The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The optimum fluid regimen has not been established. This prospective, randomized, blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid (hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution (Hartmann's Solution).\n\nMETHODS.\n120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid (N = 60) or crystalloid (N = 60) intra-operatively. The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting. Patients were interviewed to assess nausea, vomiting, anti-emetic use, dizziness, sore throat, headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2, 24 and 48 hours post operatively. Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup.\n\nRESULTS.\nAt 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea (38.2 % vs 17.9%, P = 0.03) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively (1.49 \u00b1 0.3 vs 0.68 \u00b1 0.2, P = 0.028). The incidence of vomiting and anti-emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups. Sore throat, dizziness, headache and general well being were not different between the groups. A comparable reduction on post-operative FVC and FEV-1 and PEFR was observed in both groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIntra-operative administration of colloid increased the incidence of early postoperative nausea and has no advantage over crystalloid for symptom control after gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study aimed to find if using either of two kinds of fluids during surgery could help reduce the feelings of nausea and vomiting that patients often have after surgery. The fluids we used were known as colloid and crystalloid, and we administered them via an IV drip during a specific type of gynecologic surgery called laparoscopy.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe randomly divided 120 patients to either receive the colloid or crystalloid fluid during their surgery. The amount of fluid we gave was based on the patient's weight and how many hours they had gone without food. After surgery, we checked up on the patients four times (30 minutes, 2 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery) to ask them about their symptoms. In a smaller set of patients, we also tested how well their lungs were working.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that two hours after surgery, more patients that had received the colloid fluid felt nauseous (38.2% vs 17.9%) and their nausea was also worse than those who had received the crystalloid fluid. Vomiting and use of anti-nausea medication were low in both groups. We didn't see any differences when comparing symptoms like sore throat, dizziness, headache or general well-being. Both kinds of fluid caused similar reductions in lung function.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOverall, we found that the use of colloid fluid during surgery increased post-surgery nausea and didn't have any advantages over crystalloid fluid in controlling post-surgery symptoms in gynecological laparoscopic surgery."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2256, "completion_tokens": 766, "total_tokens": 3022}}
