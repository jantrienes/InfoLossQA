This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

However, precise dose-response studies have not been completed, especially in patients at high risk for PONV who require combination therapy. This study sought to identify which dose of haloperidol 1mg or 2mg could be combined with dexamethasone without adverse effects in high-risk patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nFemale adults (n = 150) with three established PONV risk factors based on Apfel's score were randomized into one of three study groups. At the end of anesthesia, groups H0, H1, and H2 were given intravenous (IV) saline, haloperidol 1 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg, respectively. All patients were given dexamethasone 5 mg during the induction of anesthesia. The overall early (0\u20132 h) and late (2\u201324 h) incidences of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti-emetic administration, pain, and adverse effects (cardiac arrhythmias and extrapyramidal effects) were assessed postoperatively. The sedation score was recorded in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).\n\nRESULTS.\nThe total incidence of PONV over 24 h was significantly lower in groups H1 (29 %) and H2 (24 %) than in group H0 (54 %; P = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between groups H1 and H2. In the PACU, group H2 had a higher sedation score than groups H1 and H0 (P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFor high-risk PONV patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, when used with dexamethasone, 1-mg haloperidol was equally effective as 2 mg in terms of preventing PONV with the less sedative effect.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01639599).\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study looked at the best dosage of a drug called haloperidol to use in combination with another drug, dexamethasone, to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery. The focus was on people who were at high risk of nausea and vomiting, specifically women having keyhole surgery on their reproductive organs.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study involved 150 adult women who had a high risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. They were divided into three groups. At the end of the anesthesia, the first group was given a harmless saline solution, the second group was given 1 mg of haloperidol, and the third group was given 2 mg of haloperidol. Everyone was given 5 mg of dexamethasone when they were first put to sleep for the surgery. The researchers then kept track of nausea, vomiting, use of other medicines to stop vomiting, pain, and side effects in the next 24 hours. They also assessed how sleepy the patients were after the surgery in the recovery room.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall, fewer people felt sick or vomited in the 24 hours after surgery in the groups given haloperidol (29% in the 1 mg group and 24% in the 2 mg group) compared to the group given saline (54%). But there was no difference in results between the 1 mg and 2 mg haloperidol groups. The people given 2 mg of haloperidol were sleepier than the others after the surgery.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFor women having keyhole surgery on their reproductive organs who are at high risk of feeling sick or vomiting after surgery, 1 mg of haloperidol worked just as well as 2 mg in preventing these issues when used with dexamethasone. Plus, they didn't get as sleepy with the 1 mg dose.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the code NCT01639599.\n"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2393, "completion_tokens": 763, "total_tokens": 3156}}
