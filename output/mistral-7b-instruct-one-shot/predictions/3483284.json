Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Transient rises in extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have important signaling roles; and acting through purinergic receptors, can increase blood flow and oxygenation of tissues; and act as neurotransmitters. Increased blood flow not only increases substrate availability but may also aid in recovery through removal of metabolic waste products allowing muscles to accomplish more work with less fatigue. The objective of the present study was to determine if supplemental ATP would improve muscle torque, power, work, or fatigue during repeated bouts of high intensity resistance exercise.\n\nMETHODS.\nSixteen participants (8 male and 8 female; ages: 21\u201334 years) were enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study using a crossover design. The participants received either supplemental ATP (400 mg/d divided into 2 daily doses) or placebo for 15 d. After an overnight fast, participants underwent strength and fatigue testing, consisting of 3 sets of 50 maximal knee extensions performed on a Biodex\u00ae leg dynamometer.\n\nRESULTS.\nNo differences were detected in high peak torque, power, or total work with ATP supplementation; however, low peak torque in set 2 was significantly improved (p < 0.01). Additionally, in set 3, a trend was detected for less torque fatigue with ATP supplementation (p < 0.10).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nSupplementation with 400 mg ATP/d for 15 days tended to reduce muscle fatigue and improved a participant\u2019s ability to maintain a higher force output at the end of an exhaustive exercise bout.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThe body has a compound called adenosine-5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP), which is mostly found inside our cells and plays a significant role in energy supply. Brief increases in this compound level outside the cells can be useful as it helps improve blood flow and oxygen supply to tissues. It can also act as a neurotransmitter to help nerves communicate with each other. Better blood flow can assist in our body's recovery after activity by removing waste products from metabolism. It may also empower muscles to do more work without tiring. This study aims to determine if taking extra ATP can enhance muscle power and reduce fatigue during intense workouts.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe included sixteen people (8 men and 8 women; aged between 21-34 years) in a tightly controlled study that neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was getting the ATP supplements or a placebo. The participants were given either ATP supplements (400mg/day divided into two daily doses) or placebo for 15 days. After fasting overnight, the participants were made to do strength and fatigue tests, involving three sets of 50 maximum knee extensions executed on a machine called a Biodex\u00ae leg dynamometer.\n\nRESULTS.\nATP supplementation didn't make any difference in high peak power or total work. But, it did show significant improvement in low peak power in the second set. There was also a notable trend pointing towards less fatigue with ATP supplementation in the third set.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTaking 400 mg of ATP supplements every day for 15 days seemed to decrease muscle fatigue and improved a participant's capacity to maintain a higher force towards the end of an exhaustive exercise."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2252, "completion_tokens": 448, "total_tokens": 2700}}
