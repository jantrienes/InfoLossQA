This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.\n\nAIM.\nThe aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nOne hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.\n\nRESULTS.\nSynergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%\u201399% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P < 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nConvincingly, the combined application of 5% KNO3 with the diode laser can be recommended for treating DH patients.\n\n## Simplification\nCONTEXT.\nPeople who experience sensitivity in their teeth (also known as dentinal hypersensitivity or DH) often feel a sharp pain when they eat certain foods or drink certain liquids. Up to now, there hasn't been a universal treatment for this type of tooth sensitivity, though some doctors have been using various methods, including laser treatments.\n\nAIM.\nThe goal of this study was to find a way to treat tooth sensitivity using the smallest amount possible of a particular chemical and a low level of laser energy, and then keep track of those patients for a long period of time. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nOne hundred and twenty patients were randomly split into four groups: one group was treated with potassium nitrate; a second group had a procedure done with a specific type of laser; a third group both received the chemical and the laser treatment; the fourth group received a placebo or fake treatment. They measured the levels of the patients' tooth sensitivity by asking them to describe their pain before and after the treatment. This was done using tests with different materials and temperatures over a period of 6 weeks. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe group where we combined the chemical and laser treatment (Group 3) reported a significant decrease in their tooth sensitivity. In fact, by the 6th week, almost all of the patients in that group no longer felt the pain (97%-99% of them reported relief). This group performed better than the other treatment groups. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nConsidering these results, using a combination of low-dose potassium nitrate and laser treatment seems to be an effective way to treat tooth sensitivity."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2208, "completion_tokens": 663, "total_tokens": 2871}}
