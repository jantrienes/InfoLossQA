This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Salbutamol 100 \u03bcg/actuation via pMDI was permitted as reliever medication. The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to treatment period in FEV1 60-min post-dose.\n\nRESULTS.\n613 patients received treatment (formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg n = 206; 9 \u03bcg n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) male; 324 (52.9%) Japanese and 289 (47.1%) European. End of study increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose were significantly greater (p < 0.001 for both) with formoterol 4.5 and 9 \u03bcg bid (113% of baseline for both) than with placebo, as were all secondary outcome measures. The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of \u2265 4 was 50.2% for formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg (p = 0.0682 vs. placebo), 59.2% (p = 0.0004) for 9 \u03bcg, and 41.3% for placebo. Reduction in reliever medication use was significantly greater with formoterol vs. placebo (9 \u03bcg: -0.548, p < 0.001; 4.5 \u03bcg: -0.274, p = 0.027), with 9 \u03bcg being significantly superior to 4.5 \u03bcg (-0.274, p = 0.029). Formoterol was well tolerated with the incidence and type of adverse events not being different for the three groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFormoterol 4.5 \u03bcg and 9 \u03bcg bid was effective and well tolerated in patients with COPD; there was no difference between formoterol doses for the primary endpoint; however, an added value of formoterol 9 \u03bcg over 4.5 \u03bcg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT00628862 (ClinicalTrials.gov); D5122C00001 (AstraZeneca Study code).\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nA study was carried out to see how safe and effective the drug formoterol is for patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard for a person to breathe. \n\nMETHODS.\nThis tested the drug on patients aged 40 years and over across multiple countries. The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. \n\nRESULTS.\n613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo. They also reduced the reliever medication use a lot more than those taking placebo. The drug formoterol was well accepted and the side effects were not significantly different in any of the groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study found that formoterol is effective and safe for COPD patients. Two doses of the drug were tested and although both were helpful, the higher dose seemed to have more benefits for some patients.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study was registered under the numbers NCT00628862 on ClinicalTrials.gov and D5122C00001 as AstraZeneca's study code."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2459, "completion_tokens": 951, "total_tokens": 3410}}
