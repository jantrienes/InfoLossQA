Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nPatients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (\u00b1standard deviation) was 71.2 (\u00b110.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155). The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) number of follow-up visits during the 1-year study period was 1.3 (\u00b11.3) for G1, 1.6 (\u00b11.3) for G2, and 1.3 (\u00b11.1) for G3 (P=0.48). Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of \u22651 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28). Sub-analysis of adherence rates for patients who attended \u22652 follow-up visits were 91.3% (n=21/23) for G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) for G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) for G3, (P=0.11).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nHelp from a patient navigator did not increase the likelihood of keeping \u22651 follow-up appointment in an office-based setting. Adherence rates for follow-up appointments reached close to 70% or above in a self-selected patient population.\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis study looked at how having a 'patient navigator' - a person who helps guide a patient through their healthcare journey - could change how regularly patients with glaucoma go to their follow-up eye check-ups. This is important because missed appointments can lead to worse vision problems. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS. \nThe study used people who were diagnosed with some form of glaucoma after taking an eye test in Philadelphia, USA. These people were put into three groups for one year: one group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator, the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator, and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator. Then, they compared how well each group stuck to their appointment schedule. \n\nRESULTS.\n155 patients were included in this study. They were generally around 71 years old, mostly women, and primarily African-American. The number of follow-up visits during the year was about the same between the three groups. Around 70% to 82% of patients in all groups attended at least one follow-up visit. When looking at only the people who attended two or more follow-up visits, the group with a patient navigator within the community had the highest turn out. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nEven though having a patient navigator didn't make people more likely to go to an office for their check-ups, people did have a decent rate of attendance at their follow-up visits on their own. It is unclear if the community-based care with a navigator helped with the higher rate of attendance for two or more check-ups, which suggests more study is needed."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2441, "completion_tokens": 775, "total_tokens": 3216}}
