This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

This current study aimed to compare the preventive effect of hydrocortisone on intra- and post-operative shivering in patients undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nIn a clinical trial study, ninety patients who candidate for surgery with spinal anesthesia were selected and randomly divided into three groups. The first and second groups were received 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg hydrocortisone, respectively, and the third group was received normal saline, and postoperative shivering was compared between the three groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe investigation of the incidence of inter- and post-operative shivering in patients in the three groups revealed that within the study period, 31 patients suffered from shivering among which 9, 5, and 17 cases were in 1 mg/kg hydrocortisone group, 2 mg/kg hydrocortisone group, and placebo group, respectively, and according to the Chi-square test, the difference among the three groups was significant (P = 0.004).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAccording to the obtained results, the overall conclusion of the study is that using hydrocortisone at least with the dose of 1 mg/kg as a preventive drug reduced the incidence of intra- and post-operative shivering with spinal anesthesia.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nShivering after surgery is a common issue for patients who have had spinal anesthesia. This study is looking into how a drug called hydrocortisone might help prevent these shivering episodes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe tested this in a clinical trial with ninety patients who were all having surgery that required spinal anesthesia. We split them into three groups. The first two groups got different doses of hydrocortisone (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg respectively), and the third group got a saline (or saltwater) solution, which acted as a control. We then compared whether people in each group experienced shivering after their operations.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that out of the 31 patients who experienced shivering, 9 were from the first group (1 mg/kg hydrocortisone), 5 were from the second group (2 mg/kg hydrocortisone), and 17 were from the third group (normal saline). These differences were statistically significant, meaning they likely weren't due to pure chance.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur results suggest that giving patients hydrocortisone, at least in the dose of 1 mg/kg, before surgery can help reduce the chances of shivering during and after an operation involving spinal anesthesia."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2070, "completion_tokens": 548, "total_tokens": 2618}}
