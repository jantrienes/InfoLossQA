Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Outcome measures included patient self-ratings on the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a validated, nOH-specific tool that assesses symptom severity and symptom impact on daily activities.\n\nRESULTS.\nFrom randomization to endpoint (n = 162), improvement in mean OHQ composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by 0.90 units (p = 0.003). Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by 0.73 units (p = 0.010), with maximum change in \"dizziness/lightheadedness.\" Improvement in symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by 1.06 units (p = 0.003), with maximum change for \"standing a long time.\" Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP) increased by 11.2 vs 3.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), and mean supine systolic BP by 7.6 vs 0.8 mm Hg (p < 0.001). At endpoint, supine systolic BP >180 mm Hg was observed in 4.9% of droxidopa and 2.5% of placebo recipients. Adverse events reported in \u22653% of double-blind droxidopa recipients were headache (7.4%) and dizziness (3.7%). No patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn patients with symptomatic nOH, droxidopa improved symptoms and symptom impact on daily activities, with an associated increase in standing systolic BP, and was generally well tolerated.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE.\nThis study provides Class I evidence that in patients with symptomatic nOH who respond to open-label droxidopa, droxidopa improves subjective and objective manifestation of nOH at 7 days.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL\nThe aim was to find out if a drug called droxidopa can help improve a condition where a person's blood pressure drops when they stand up (nOH), specifically in people with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy.\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with the above conditions were given droxidopa in doses that were adjusted according to their response. This was followed by a 7-day break, after which they were given either droxidopa or a placebo for 7 days. Their progress was tracked using a special questionnaire that measures the severity of their symptoms and how it affects their daily activities.\n\nRESULTS\nThe results showed that the patients given droxidopa had a better improvement in their symptoms compared to those given a placebo. They especially felt better about dizziness and standing for long periods. Their standing blood pressure also increased more than those on the placebo. Side effects were rare and included minor headache and dizziness. No patients stopped the treatment because of side effects.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDroxidopa appears to help improve symptoms in patients whose blood pressure drops when they stand up. It seems to improve their daily life functioning and increases their standing blood pressure. Generally, the drug is well tolerated.\n\nEVIDENCE LEVEL\nThis study offers strong evidence that droxidopa helps improve symptoms in patients whose blood pressure drops when they stand up over a 7-day period.\n"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2366, "completion_tokens": 1082, "total_tokens": 3448}}
