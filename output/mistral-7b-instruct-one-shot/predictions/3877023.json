This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

This patient subset was part of a larger cohort. Image quality was assessed by determining qualitative parameters, signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR), and quantitative contour sharpness.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe image quality parameters were higher for short-bore MR imaging. Regarding all sequences, the relative differences were 39% for the mean overall qualitative image quality, 53% for the mean SNR values, and 34\u201337% for the quantitative contour sharpness (P<0.0001). The CNR values were also higher for images obtained with the short-bore MR scanner. No sequence was of very poor (nondiagnostic) image quality. Scanning times were significantly longer for examinations performed on the open MR scanner (mean: 32\u00b122 min versus 20\u00b19 min; P<0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn this randomized controlled comparison of spinal MR imaging with an open versus a short-bore scanner, short-bore MR imaging revealed considerably higher image quality with shorter scanning times.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00715806\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study aimed to compare the picture quality of two different methods used in the scanning of the spine through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\u2014the high-field horizontal open method and the short-bore method. \n\nMETHODS.\n93 patients (80% of them being women, with an average age of 53) were randomly chosen to have their spines scanned using either a 1-T horizontal open scanner or a 1.5-T short-bore scanner. The quality of the images produced by each scanner was then assessed by looking at certain aspects, such as the level of detail and brightness, and how sharp the outline of the images appeared.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe short-bore method produced higher quality images. On average, the short-bore images were 39% better in quality, 53% brighter, and 34-37% sharper in outline (P<0.0001). Images from short-bore scans also showed superior contrast. Importantly, none of the scans were so poor in quality that they couldn't be used. The short-bore scanner also took less time to complete the scans.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nWhen comparing the quality of spine imaging using an open scanner versus a short-bore scanner, the study found that the short-bore method produced better quality images and took less time.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, with the number NCT00715806."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2172, "completion_tokens": 403, "total_tokens": 2575}}
