This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

The purpose of this study was evaluation of effect of Semelil (ANGIPARSTM), a new herbal drug for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers or diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn this double blind clinical trial, 49 type 2 diabetes patients with different degrees of neuropathy were evaluated in two groups (ANGIPARSTM and placebo groups). All patients were assessed at the start and 12 weeks after treatment, with laboratory tests, United Kingdom screening test, Michigan neuropathy screening score, Michigan diabetic neuropathy score, vibration perception thresholds, nerve conduction study, monofilament test and visual analog scale.\n\nRESULTS.\nMichigan diabetic neuropathy score was decreased notably in ANGIPARSTM group. In the nerve conduction study, appropriate meaningful changes were observed in the distal latency and amplitude in the motor Ulnar nerve in ANGIPARSTM group.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe results showed limited evidence of efficacy of ANGIPARSTM in diabetic neuropathy treatment and more studies with a larger sample size and longer duration are required.\n\n## Simplification\nWHY THE STUDY WAS DONE:\nThe study aimed to find out whether a new herbal medicine called Semelil (or ANGIPARSTM) has any positive effects on diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulcers are a common condition in people with diabetes, and often lead to significant health problems and costs.\n\nHOW THE STUDY WAS DONE:\nIn the study, 49 people with type 2 diabetes and varying degrees of foot ulcers were divided into two groups. One group was given the new medicine and the other was given a placebo (a treatment with no active ingredient). The patients went through a series of tests before and after the study to measure the effects of the medicine.\n\nWHAT THE STUDY FOUND:\nThe study found some evidence that the new medicine had a positive effect on the patients' foot ulcers. There were noticeable changes in the motor Ulnar nerve, which is one of the nerves in the arm that can be affected by diabetes.\n\nTHE STUDY'S CONCLUSIONS:\nThe study concluded that while the medicine had some effect, more research with larger groups of people and over longer periods of time is needed to truly gauge its effectiveness."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1972, "completion_tokens": 719, "total_tokens": 2691}}
