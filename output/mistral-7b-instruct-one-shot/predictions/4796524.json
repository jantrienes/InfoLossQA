This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

This study designed to reduce complications related to stent extraction.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\n90 patients prepared for renal transplantation during 1 year randomly classified to groups, study group: patients with attached stent to Foley catheter, control group: patients with conventional technique (stent separated from Foley) then in their follow up; UTI, stent crustation, luts severity compared to each other.\n\nRESULTS.\nSecond week and fourth week UTI reported 25.6%, 2.3% in study group versus 34.9%, 4.7% in control group (P value 0.48 and 0.5). Urinary leakage was 3.3% overall, that all of them occurred in separate stent group, 37.5% vs. 0% in the linked stent group. Stent crustation in separate stent was 25% compared with 0% in the linked stent.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nLow complications rate in linked stent group, despite the lack of significant statistical differences, but indicate the effectiveness and success of the new technique.\n\n## Simplification\nINTRODUCTION.\nWhen a person has a kidney transplant, a tube called a stent is often used to help the new kidney function properly. But there are problems with this. Sometimes, the stent can become clogged up and need to be removed, which can lead to pain, infection, and other complications. This study is trying to find a better way to use the stent to avoid these problems.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nWe looked at 90 patients who were going to have a kidney transplant within a year. We split them into two groups. In one group, the stent was attached to a catheter. In the other group, the stent was used in the standard way, separate from the catheter. We then compared rates of infection, how often the stent got blocked, and how bad any urinary symptoms were between the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter two and four weeks, fewer patients in the group where the stent was attached to the catheter had an infection compared to the standard group. Overall, urinary leakage was slight, but it only happened in the standard group. Stent blockage only happened in the standard group too.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAlthough the differences between the two groups weren't big enough to be statistically significant, the group where the stent was attached to the catheter had fewer complications. This suggests that this new technique could be a better way to use the stent following a kidney transplant."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2086, "completion_tokens": 440, "total_tokens": 2526}}
