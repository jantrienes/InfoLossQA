The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

This study evaluated safety and efficacy of a combination approach of chemotherapy followed by chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) +/\u2212 cetuximab, and the prognostic role of miR-21 in patients with LAPC treated with a multimodality approach.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThis was a randomised phase II trial in which patients with inoperable LAPC were offered gemcitabine and capecitabine (GEM-CAP) for 16 weeks. Patients with stable disease or response after GEM-CAP were randomised to capecitabine or UFT plus radiotherapy (RT) (A), or capecitabine or UFT plus cetuximab plus RT (B). The primary outcome of the study was overall survival (OS). Clinical outcome was compared according to baseline circulating miR-21 levels.\n\nRESULTS.\n17 patients were enrolled and treated with GEM-CAP, with 13 patients achieving disease control and being randomised to arms A (n:7) and B (n:6). After a median follow-up of 61.2 months, median progression free survival (PFS) was 10.4 months and 12.7 months, median OS was 15.8 months and 22.0 months in arms A and B respectively (p > 0.05). Patients with high baseline plasma miR-21 had worse PFS (3.5 vs. 12.7 months; p:0.032) and OS (5.1 vs 15.3 months; p:0.5) compared to patients with low miR-21. Circulating miR-21 levels reflected miR-21 expression within the tissues.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAddition of Cetuximab to CRT following induction chemotherapy did not improve survival. High miR-21 baseline plasma expression was associated with poor clinical outcome in LAPC patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemo-radiotherapy.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis research focused on a type of pancreatic cancer that is hard to treat and often results in death. Specifically, it tested if a combined treatment of chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy with or without an extra drug called cetuximab would help. It also checked if a biomarker (something in your body that can be measured to show the presence of disease), called miR-21, could predict how patients would respond to the treatment.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nIn this trial, patients who couldn't undergo surgery for their pancreatic cancer were given a specific combination of drugs for 16 weeks. Only patients whose cancer didn't worsen or even improved after this initial treatment were then given another drug either with or without cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy. The key measure of success was overall survival rate. They also compared people's response to the treatment based on their levels of the biomarker miR-21.\n\nRESULTS.\n17 patients took the initial drugs, and 13 of them improved enough to receive the extra treatments. After about 5 years, they recorded how long it took for patients' cancers to get worse and how long the patients lived overall. They didn't see a big difference whether patients received the extra drug cetuximab or not. They did find that patients with high levels of the biomarker miR-21 generally did worse compared to those with lower levels, in terms of both how quickly their cancer got worse and how long they lived.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAdding cetuximab to the chemo-radiotherapy after the initial combination drug treatment didn't seem to improve survival rates. Having a high level of the miR-21 biomarker at the start was linked to patients faring worse. This suggests it might be a useful predictor for this particular combination treatment for this type of hard-to-treat pancreatic cancer."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2347, "completion_tokens": 637, "total_tokens": 2984}}
