This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that compared with monotherapy using a higher dose of palonosetron, using a lower dose of palonosetron in combination with droperidol could reduce the incidence of PONV and achieve similar prophylaxis against PONV after the aforementioned surgery.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nA total of 129 patients who were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II, aged between 18 and 70 years, and scheduled for eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery, were enrolled in this study. They were randomized into three groups: Group P2.5 (2.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron), Group P7.5 (7.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron), and Group P+D (2.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron and 15 \u03bcg/kg droperidol). Patients received the different antiemetic regimens intravenously 5 min before surgery. The severity of nausea and vomiting and the complete response (CR) rate during a 72-h postoperative period were assessed.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll patients completed the trial. The nausea score of Group P2.5 was significantly higher than those of the other two groups at 0\u20134 h and 24\u201348 h (P<0.05). Vomiting scores among all groups were similar during all intervals (P>0.05). Compared with Group P2.5, the CR rate was significantly improved at all intervals in Group P+D, except at 4\u201372 h, and was also elevated at 24\u201372 h in Group P7.5 (P<0.05). Fewer patients in Group P2.5 did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study (49%) compared with those in Group P7.5 (67%) and Group P+D (81%; P<0.01).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nCombining low-dose palonosetron with droperidol potentiated prophylaxis for PONV and achieved a similar prophylactic effect as that with a higher dose of palonosetron.\n\n## Simplification\nOBJECTIVE:\nThis study investigates if combining a low dose of the drug palonosetron with another drug called droperidol can help to reduce sickness (nausea and vomiting) experienced after a certain eye surgery, compared to using a higher dose of palonosetron alone. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nThis trial involved 129 adults, aged 18 to 70, that are categorised as healthy or having mild illness by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. They were going to have eye and orbital implant surgery. These patients were divided into three groups and each group received different anti-sickness treatments just before their surgery. Their levels of nausea, vomiting, and overall response to treatment were assessed for 72 hours after surgery. \n\nRESULTS:\nAll involved patients finished the study. The group receiving a low dose of palonosetron had more severe nausea than the other two groups at 0-4 and 24-48 hours after surgery. Vomiting levels were similar across all the groups. The complete response (no nausea or vomiting) rate was better in the group receiving a low-dose of palonosetron and droperidol than in the low dose palonosetron alone group, except at 4-72 hours, and was also better at 24-72 hours in the high dose palonosetron group. Less than half (49%) of the patients in the low dose palonosetron alone group didn't experience any sickness, compared to 67% in the high dose group and 81% in the combined treatment group.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nCombining a low dose of palonosetron with droperidol was better at preventing post-surgery sickness and produced similar results to using a high dose of palonosetron alone."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2407, "completion_tokens": 526, "total_tokens": 2933}}
