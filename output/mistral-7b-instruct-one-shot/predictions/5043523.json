Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study.

The present study aims to test this hypothesis using data from the Food4Me study. This was a 6-month Internet-based randomised controlled trial conducted across seven centres in Europe where individuals received either general healthy eating advice or varying levels of personalised nutrition advice. Participants who received genotype-based personalised advice were informed whether they had the risk (CT/TT) (n = 178) or non-risk (CC) (n = 141) alleles of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in relation to cardiovascular health and the importance of a sufficient intake of folate. General linear model analysis was used to assess changes in folate intake between the MTHFR risk, MTHFR non-risk and control groups from baseline to month 6 of the intervention.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no differences between the groups for age, gender or BMI. However, there was a significant difference in country distribution between the groups (p = 0.010). Baseline folate intakes were 412 \u00b1 172, 391 \u00b1 190 and 410 \u00b1 186 \u03bcg per 10 MJ for the risk, non-risk and control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of changes in folate intakes from baseline to month 6. Similarly, there were no changes in reported intake of food groups high in folate.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese results suggest that knowledge of MTHFR 677C \u2192 T genotype did not improve folate intake in participants with the risk variant compared with those with the non-risk variant.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01530139\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12263-016-0539-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThe researchers wanted to see if knowing about your personal genetic risks would encourage you to make healthier diet and lifestyle choices. They ran a 6-month online trial across seven locations in Europe. Some people received general healthy eating advice while others received advice tailored to their personal nutrition needs. One specific group learned whether they had a certain gene variant that increased their risk of heart disease. They were told about the importance of eating enough folate, a type of B vitamin. The researchers then analyzed changes in their folate intake over six months. \n\nRESULTS.\nThere wasn't any difference in age, gender, or body weight between the groups. Although, the number of participants from each country was not evenly spread across the groups. The amount of folate the groups ate at the start of the trial was about the same. Over six months, no group's folate intake changed significantly. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe finding implies that just knowing if you have a risky gene variant does not necessarily encourage you to eat more folate. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial is recorded on ClinicalTrials.gov under the number NCT01530139\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThere is additional information online for this study, which can be accessed by authorized individuals."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2209, "completion_tokens": 624, "total_tokens": 2833}}
