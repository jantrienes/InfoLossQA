The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study.

Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.\n\nRESULTS.\nContrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47\u2009=\u20094.438; p\u2009=\u20090.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2\u2009=\u20093.3; p\u2009=\u20090.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAlthough mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nResearch has shown that putting CO2 in the nose can help reduce pain in animals, probably by activating a specific type of neuron (nerve cells). Some evidence suggests that inhaling CO2 might also help people with facial pain. This is thought to work by activating the same kind of neurons in the nose, leading to effects that can help control pain. This study aims to see how CO2 in the nose affects facial pain caused by capsaicin, a substance that causes a burning sensation.\n\nMETHODS:\nIn this experiment, 48 healthy volunteers who never had facial pain before were made to feel a type of facial pain through the nasal application of capsaicin. They then had either CO2 or air alternately puffed into their nostrils for 60 seconds each. After that, they were split into two groups, where one group continuously received CO2 in the nose while the other received a placebo. They were asked to rate their level of pain every minute. \n\nRESULTS:\nThe results weren't as promising as the previous animal studies. The CO2 only slightly reduced the pain by about 5.3% compared to air and these effects were not seen after continuous implementation of CO2 or the placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough a small reduction in pain was observed in this study where CO2 was administered to activate a specific type of neuron, the results were not significant enough to make a real difference in the clinical treatment of facial pain."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2350, "completion_tokens": 1041, "total_tokens": 3391}}
