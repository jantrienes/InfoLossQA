The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Between April 2014 and January 2015, sixty-nine patients with 74 HCCs were randomly treated with RFA using either internally cooled-wet (ICW) electrodes in SB mode (SB-RFA, n = 36) or SC electrodes in SM mode (SM-RFA, n = 38). Technical parameters including the number of ablations, ablation time, volume, energy delivery, and complications were evaluated. Thereafter, 1-year and 2-year local tumor progression (LTP) free survival rates were compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn the SB-RFA group, less number of ablations were required (1.72\u00b10.70 vs. 2.31\u00b11.37, P = 0.039), the ablation time was shorter (10.9\u00b13.9 vs.14.3\u00b15.0 min, p = 0.004), and energy delivery was smaller (13.1\u00b16.3 vs.23.4\u00b112.8 kcal, p<0.001) compared to SM-RFA. Ablation volume was not significantly different between SB-RFA and SM-RFA groups (61.8\u00b124.3 vs.54.9\u00b123.7 cm3, p = 0.229). Technical failure occurred in one patient in the SM-RFA group, and major complications occurred in one patient in each group. The 1-year and 2-year LTP free survival rates were 93.9% and 84.3% in the SB-RFA group and 94.4% and 88.4% in the SM-RFA group (p = 0.687).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth SB-RFA using ICW electrodes and SM-RFA using SC electrodes provided comparable LTP free survival rates although SB-RFA required less ablations and shorter ablation time.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL:\nWe ran a study to compare two methods of a treatment called radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for people with liver cancer. One method uses something called switching bipolar (SB) RFA with cooled-wet electrodes, the other uses switching monopolar (SM) RFA with separable clustered electrodes.\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe got the go-ahead from our ethics board for this study. From April 2014 to January 2015, we randomly selected 69 patients with liver cancer to undergo one of the two RFA methods we're comparing. Parameters like how many treatments were needed, how long each treatment lasted, energy used, side-effects and the benefits of the treatment were tracked for each patient. We then compared how many patients remained without cancer after 1 and 2 years between the two groups.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nThe group who underwent SB-RFA needed fewer treatments, each treatment went quicker, and required less energy compared to the SM-RFA group. There was no significant difference in overall treatment volume between the two groups. There was one technical issue with the SM-RFA method, and there was one major side effect in each group. Yet, the two-year cancer-free rates were nearly the same for both groups (about 84-88% remained cancer-free).\n\nCONCLUSION:\nBoth methods had similar cancer-free rates after 2 years, however, the SB-RFA treatment method was quicker and needed fewer sessions."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2331, "completion_tokens": 1034, "total_tokens": 3365}}
