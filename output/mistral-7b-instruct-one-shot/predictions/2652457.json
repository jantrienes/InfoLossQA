This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

In this study, a computer assisted learning (CAL) package, containing educationally appropriate knowledge about autism was developed; and the effectiveness of this CAL package was evaluated.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe CAL package was developed using computer software, \"Xerte\" and \"Flash Macromedia\". The effectiveness of the CAL package was evaluated in 32 childcare students in the UK, who were randomised to watch the CAL package or to read the information leaflet containing the same information (n = 16 in each group). Retention performance, level of enjoyment, and level of confidence to identify a child with autism, after the interventions, were evaluated. The data obtained from two studied groups was analysed using unpaired Student's t-test, 95% confidence interval, and effect size.\n\nRESULTS.\nStudents who watched the CAL package had superior retention performance percentage scores (p = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.83\u201312.19, effect size = 0.8) and level of enjoyment (p = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.03\u20132.75, effect size = 0.7) compared with students who read the information leaflet. However, there was no significant difference in level of confidence to identify a child with autism (p = 0.39, 95% CI = -1.80\u20130.72, effect size = -0.3).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CAL package developed was an effective method of educating people who work with children about autism.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was performed to show the importance of increasing autism awareness among those who work with children, as it could lead to an earlier diagnosis. For this, the researchers developed a computer program which teaches properly about autism and then checked how well it did the job.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe computer program, a learning tool, was created using two types of computer software. To test its effectiveness, they gave it to 32 childcare students in the UK. Half of these students got to learn with this computer program, while the other half read a leaflet containing the same information. To see how well they learned, the researchers checked how much they remembered, how much they enjoyed the process, and how confident they felt in recognizing a child with autism. Then, they used statistical methods to analyze the data from both groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nStudents who used the computer program remembered more information and enjoyed learning more as compared to students who read the leaflet. However, both groups had the same level of confidence in recognizing a child with autism.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFrom this study, the researchers concluded that the computer program they developed was a useful tool in teaching people who work with children about autism."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2059, "completion_tokens": 614, "total_tokens": 2673}}
