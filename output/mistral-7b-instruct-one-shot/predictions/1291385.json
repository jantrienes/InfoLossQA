The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The aim of the study was to compare the effect of co-administered dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium (diclofenac K) with diclofenac K alone on the postoperative pain, swelling and trismus after surgical removal of third molars.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nA prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. A total of 100 patients were randomly allocated to two treatment groups of dexamethasone (prophylactic 8 mg and postoperative 4 mg IV) and diclofenac K (50 mg Oral before and after surgery), and diclofenac K alone (as with first group). The overall analgesic efficacy of the drug combinations was assessed postoperatively by determination of pain intensity using a category rating scale. Facial swelling was measured using a tape measure placed from tragus to gonion to tragus, while interincisal mouth-opening of patients was measured using a vernier calibrated caliper pre-operatively and post-operatively.\n\nRESULTS.\nCo-administration of dexamethasone and diclofenac K was significantly superior to diclofenac alone for the relief of pain (P < 0.05), and facial swelling up to post-operative 48 hour (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference for trismus relief between the two medication protocols (P > 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis study illustrates enhanced effects of co-administered dexamethasone and diclofenac K on short-term post-operative pain and swelling, compared to diclofenac potassium alone in third molar surgery.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis research aims to see if combining two types of medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids, can result in better relief from inflammation and pain after surgery, and with fewer side effects. The study focused on the effects of a steroid (dexamethasone) and an anti-inflammatory (diclofenac potassium) when used together, compared to just using diclofenac potassium alone. The effects were measured on patients undergoing the surgical removal of their third molars, more commonly known as wisdom teeth.\n\nRESEARCH METHODS.\nThis was a study where patients didn't know which treatment they were getting to ensure an unbiased result. It was done at a hospital in Nigeria. One hundred patients who were having their wisdom teeth removed were randomly selected and divided into two groups. One group received both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium, while the other group only received diclofenac potassium. The researchers then measured the overall effectiveness of the medications for relief from pain. They also measured the swelling of the patients' faces and the ability of their mouths to open before and after the operation.\n\nRESULTS.\nUsing both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together was found to provide significantly better relief from pain and facial swelling in the first 48 hours post-surgery compared to using diclofenac potassium alone. However, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the patient's mouth-opening ability.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAccording to this study, using both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together improves short-term relief from post-surgery pain and swelling, compared to using diclofenac potassium alone in patients getting their wisdom teeth removed."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2301, "completion_tokens": 960, "total_tokens": 3261}}
