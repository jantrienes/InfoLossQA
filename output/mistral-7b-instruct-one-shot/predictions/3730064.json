This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal NV areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal NV areas were compared before and after the injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nSeven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal NV secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). In group I, the preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 \u00b1 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 \u00b1 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 \u00b1 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). The corneal NV area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 \u00b1 4.33% to 6.72 \u00b1 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal NV area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 \u00b1 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 \u00b1 11.64%, p = 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal NV compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal NV require further investigation.\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis study aims to compare the short-term effects of two kinds of injections, namely, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, on the shrinking of unusual blood vessels in the cornea (the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the eye).\n\nMETHODS.\nSixteen patients suffering from abnormal blood vessels in the cornea were randomly chosen to receive one of either a bevacizumab or ranibizumab injection. They were checked before the injection, a week after the injection, and a month after the injection to measure how much their blood vessels shrunk. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe patients, aged around 51, developed abnormal blood vessels in the cornea due to various reasons like eye infections or chemical burns. After the bevacizumab injection, a clear reduction in unusual blood vessels was noticed both a week and a month after the treatment. The ranibizumab injection also resulted in reduced abnormal vessels after a week, but the change was not significant a month later. In group 1, treated with bevacizumab, the shrinkage in unusual vessels was significantly higher than in group 2, treated with ranibizumab.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study concluded that bevacizumab injection was more effective in reducing the unusual blood vessel growth in the cornea compared to the ranibizumab injection. However, further research is needed to understand the effectiveness and the right dosage of these two treatments."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2283, "completion_tokens": 508, "total_tokens": 2791}}
