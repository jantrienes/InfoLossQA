This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

During the treatment, patients in the study group received mental clinical nursing pathway care, while those in the control group were given the usual nursing care, such as timely inspection, nurse's reactions to patient's behavior, and execution of medical orders. Thereafter, the \"self-rating idea of suicide scale\" and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) were used to compare the differences in the suicidal ideation of patients with malignant tumors between the two groups before and after the treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no statistical differences in the scores of despair factor, optimistic factor, sleep factor, and cover factor between the two groups before the treatment (P>0.05). After different styles of nursing, the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the score of cover factor between the two groups (P>0.05). The KPS of patients receiving mental clinical nursing pathway care was higher than those receiving usual nursing care, and there was a statistical significant difference between the two groups (P<0.01). Interestingly, the patients' suicidal ideation scale was negatively correlated with KPS (r =\u22120.29, P<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor individuals diagnosed with a malignant tumor, using a mental health clinical nursing pathway can effectively decrease the degree of suicidal ideation and positively impact the quality of life.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was made to look into how special mental health nursing plans can help reduce thoughts of suicide and improve life quality in patients suffering from serious cancer types.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo groups of 100 serious cancer patients each were formed - one was the study group and the other was the control group. Patients in the study group were given special mental health nursing care, while those in the control group received normal nursing care. After this, we used two tools - a 'self-rating suicide thoughts scale' and a method to assess physical and mental abilities (Karnofsky Performance Status/KPS), to see the change in suicidal thoughts among the cancer patients in the two groups, before and after the treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the different nursing styles were given, the two groups didn't really differ on the factors of despair, optimism, sleep, and hiding their feelings. After the special nursing, patients from the study group showed lower levels in these areas than the control group, except for hiding their feelings where there was no big difference. Patients who did receive the special mental health nursing showed higher physical and mental abilities (KPS), and there was a clear difference between the two groups. Additionally, the more the physical and mental abilities increased, the less the suicide thoughts occurred.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor patients diagnosed with a serious type of cancer, following a special mental health nursing plan can significantly lessen thoughts of suicide and greatly improve their quality of life."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2126, "completion_tokens": 705, "total_tokens": 2831}}
