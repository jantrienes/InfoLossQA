This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Patients and parents completed the revised KINDL questionnaire for measuring health-related QoL in children and adolescents (KINDL-R) at baseline and endpoint. The mean change in CDRS-R total and item scores were used to compare improvement in symptomatology in patients taking OFC and placebo. Tests were 2-sided using a Type I error cutoff of 0.05, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.\n\nRESULTS.\nBaseline QoL as measured by the KINDL-R was substantially impaired relative to published norms for a healthy school-based sample. OFC-treated patients demonstrated an improvement over placebo at endpoint with respect to mean change from baseline in the patient-rated KINDL-R Self-esteem subscale score (p = 0.028), and in the parent KINDL-R ratings of emotional well-being (p = 0.020), Self-esteem (p = 0.030), and Family (p = 0.006). At endpoint, OFC-treated patients still had a lower QoL compared to the normative population. OFC showed significant improvement (p \u2264 0.05) versus placebo on the CDRS-R total score and on 7 of the 17 CDRS-R items.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nPatients aged 10\u201317 years with an acute episode of bipolar depression and their parents reported greater improvements (parents noticed improvements in more areas than did their offspring) on some aspects of QoL when treated with OFC compared with placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, KINDL-R endpoint scores remained lower than those of the, presumably healthy, control population.  \nClinical trial registration information A Study for Assessing Treatment of Patients Ages 10\u201317 with Bipolar Depression; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00844857\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study looked at whether a combination of two drugs, olanzapine and fluoxetine (OFC), is effective in helping improve the life quality of kids and teenagers suffering from bipolar depression. \n\nMETHODS.\nPatients between the ages of 10 and 17 who have bipolar I disorder and are currently in a depressive phase were selected for this study. These patients were then divided into two groups: one received the drug combination (OFC), and the other received a placebo (a substance with no treatment effect). They were treated for up to 8 weeks. Using a questionnaire filled out by both patients and their parents at the beginning and end of the study, we were able to measure their life quality. We also checked the degree of depression symptoms by comparing scores of specific scales before and after treatment. \n\nRESULTS.\nAt the start of the study, the patients' quality of life was much lower than what you'd expect from a healthy child or teenager of the same age. After treatment, those who received the drug combination showed improvement in how they felt about themselves and in their emotional well-being, according to both the children and their parents. The parents also noted improvements in family dynamics. However, even after treatment, these patients' quality of life remained lower than that of a typical healthy child or teenager. The group that received the drug combination also demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared to the placebo group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBased on the study, children and teenagers experiencing a depressive phase of bipolar disorder, as well as their parents, reported better improvements in some aspects of life quality when treated with the drug combination than with the placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, their life quality was still lower than that of their healthy peers.
