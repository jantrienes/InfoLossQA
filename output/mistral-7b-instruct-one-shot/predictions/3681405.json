This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Both treatments were followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The end point of this study included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and survival rate associated with clinical remission.\n\nRESULTS.\nStatistical survival difference was found between the preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery arm and the surgery-alone arm. However, the median survival time (MST) in the preoperative chemotherapy arm was lower than that of surgery-alone arm (MST, 45.42 months vs 57.59 months) (P = 0.016). When comparing the effect of preoperative chemotherapy at each stage of NSCLC, a statistical survival difference was found in stage II NSCLC but not in stage I and IIIA (MST 40.86 months vs 80.81 months) (P = 0.044). However, no statistically significant difference in PFS was noticed between the two arms, except for stage I NSCLC (hazard radio [HR] = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.561\u20131.629; P = 0.027). The survival rate was higher for patients who had clinical remission after preoperative chemotherapy, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (MST 42.10 months vs 35.33 months) (P = 0.630).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPreoperative chemotherapy did not show benefits in OS and PFS for stage I\u2013IIIA NSCLC patients.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL:\nWe wanted to see if giving chemotherapy before surgery improved life expectancy and disease outlook for patients with a certain type of lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer) in stages I to IIIA, but not in the very earliest sub-stage of Stage I.\n\nMETHODS:\nIn this study, 356 patients with Stage I (except the earliest sub-stage), II, and IIIA lung cancer were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group received chemotherapy before surgery (179 patients), and the other group had surgery first (177 patients). Both groups received additional chemotherapy after the surgery. We were particularly interested in comparing overall survival, the duration of time patients lived without their disease getting worse, and the survival rate of patients who showed signs of recovery.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe found some difference in survival rates between the group that received preoperative chemotherapy and the group that only had surgery. However, patients who had chemotherapy first survived on average for a shorter amount of time (about 45 months vs about 58 months in the surgery-only group). When we looked at each cancer stage separately, we found some difference in survival rates only in Stage II patients. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in how long patients lived without their disease getting worse, except in Stage I patients. Finally, patients who seemed to get better after preoperative chemotherapy lived longer, but this difference was not big enough to be sure it wasn't due to chance.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGiving chemotherapy before surgery did not significantly improve overall survival or delay disease progression for patients in stages I-III of non-small cell lung cancer."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2236, "completion_tokens": 593, "total_tokens": 2829}}
