This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Open pyeloplasty remains the standard against which new technique must be compared. We compared laparoscopic (LP) and open pyeloplasty (OP) in a randomized prospective trial.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nA prospective randomized study was done from January 2004 to January 2007 in which a total of 28 laparoscopic and 34 open pyeloplasty were done. All laparoscopic pyeloplasties were performed transperitoneally. Standard open Anderson Hynes pyeloplasty, spiral flap or VY plasty was done depending on anatomic consideration. Patients were followed with DTPA scan at three months and IVP at six months. Perioperative parameters including operative time, analgesic use, hospital stay, and complication and success rates were compared.\n\nRESULTS.\nMean total operative time with stent placement in LP group was 244.2 min (188-300 min) compared to 122 min (100-140 min) in OP group. Compared to OP group, the post operative diclofenac requirement was significantly less in LP group (mean 107.14 mg) and OP group required mean of (682.35 mg). The duration of analgesic requirement was also significantly less in LP group. The postoperative hospital stay in LP was mean 3.14 Days (2-7 days) significantly less than the open group mean of 8.29 days (7-11 days).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nLP has a minimal level of morbidity and short hospital stay compared to open approach. Although, laparoscopic pyeloplasty has the disadvantages of longer operative time and requires significant skill of intracorporeal knotting but it is here to stay and represents an emerging standard of care.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is a condition that can lead to kidney problems if not treated. The traditional treatment is a type of surgery known as open pyeloplasty. In this study, we compared this traditional treatment to a newer technique called laparoscopic pyeloplasty.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, we performed 28 laparoscopic and 34 open pyeloplasty surgeries. The laparoscopic surgeries were performed through the abdominal cavity. The traditional surgeries were done based on the patient's specific needs. After surgery, we monitored patients with scans. We also compared how long the surgeries took, how much pain medication was used, how long patients stayed in the hospital, and the rates of complications and success.\n\nRESULTS.\nOn average, the laparoscopic surgeries took longer. However, the patients who had laparoscopic surgery needed significantly less pain medication and stayed in the hospital for a shorter amount of time.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nLaparoscopic surgery has some downsides, such as the longer surgery time and the advanced skills required. However, these surgeries have lower risks and quicker recovery times. Thus, laparoscopic surgery is becoming a new standard for treating this condition."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2205, "completion_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 2588}}
