This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

The first line of treatment for oral LP (OLP) has been corticosteroids, but because of their adverse effects, alternative therapeutic approaches are being carried out, of which the recent natural alternative is propolis.\n\nAIM.\nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy of topical propolis in the management of OLP.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe research group consisted of 27 patients diagnosed with symptomatic OLP, among which 15 patients were in the control group and the rest 12 were in the study group. The patients in the control group received triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (topical application) while the patients in the study group received propolis gel. Both the groups were evaluated for pain and erythema at baseline (1st visit), first follow-up (7th day), and second follow-up (14th day) using numerical rating scale and modified oral mucositis index.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe patients in both the study and control groups showed a statistically significant reduction (P = 0.000 for the study group and P = 0.000 for the control group) in pain and erythema scores from baseline to second follow-up visit. However, on comparison of the reduction in pain and erythema scores between the two groups, the difference was found to be statistically insignificant (P = 0.255).\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED.\nChi-square and Cramer's V test were used.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe topical propolis was found to be of comparative effectiveness with respect to triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% in the management of OLP.\n\n## Simplification\nINTRODUCTION.\nLichen planus is a lasting skin disease that we don't know the cause of and is often treated with steroids. These steroids can have negative side effects, so researchers are trying to find other ways to treat it. Right now, they're looking into using propolis, which is a natural product created by bees.\n\nAIM.\nThe goal of this study is to see if propolis can be used effectively to treat lichen planus.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study involved 27 people who have been diagnosed with a type of lichen planus that affects the inside of the mouth. Fifteen of these people were given a common treatment (a 0.1% mix of a steroid), while the other twelve were given a gel made from propolis. Over two weeks, both groups were regularly checked for pain and redness.\n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups - those treated with steroids and those treated with propolis - showed a significant decrease in pain and redness by the end of two weeks. The decrease in these symptoms between the two groups wasn't significant enough to be conclusive.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED.\nChi-square and Cramer's V test were used to analyze the results.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn conclusion, propolis (the product made by bees) seemed to be as effective as steroids in treating this type of lichen planus."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2170, "completion_tokens": 725, "total_tokens": 2895}}
