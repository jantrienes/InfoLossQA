This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 \u00b1 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7\u201314 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPatient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicaltrials.gov. Identifier NCT01278537\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis research was designed to see if educating older cancer patients about their surgery would affect their recovery time or their health and quality of life one year after their procedure.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween February 2011 and January 2014, the research took place in two major medical centers in Germany. We had patients who were 65 years or older who were getting surgery for stomach, urinary, and chest cancer. We randomly put these patients into two groups. One group received an information booklet and kept a diary\u2014a way to give more power to the patient. The other group was given the usual care. We measured how long they had to stay in the hospital after their surgery and their health and life quality after a year. We also looked at their stress and any complications after surgery. Lastly, we wanted to identify any factors that could predict their hospital stay and life quality at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had 652 patients with an average age of around 72, and most were men. On average, patients stayed in the hospital for 9 days after their surgery. There wasn't a significant difference in hospital stay or life quality after a year between the two groups. While three out of four people had some kind of complication after the surgery, the frequency and severity were the same in both groups. However, those who received the information booklet and kept a diary reported having less pain after their surgery. The factors that determined how long patients stayed in the hospital were how severe the surgery was, how long the anesthesia lasted, any major complications after surgery, a patient's nutrition level, and their physical ability before surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nGiving patients more information about their surgery and having them keep a diary did not shorten their hospital stay. However, it did result in less reported pain after surgery. How long a patient had to stay in the hospital was determined by their nutrition level, physical ability, the severity of the surgery, and how long the anesthesia lasted.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT01278537."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2531, "completion_tokens": 617, "total_tokens": 3148}}
