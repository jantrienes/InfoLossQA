This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

We examined engagement generated by content based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) in a motivationally tailored smoking cessation intervention on Facebook.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study aimed to identify which intervention content based on the TTM (Decisional Balance and 10 processes of change) generated the highest engagement among participants in pre-action stages of change (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation).\n\nMETHODS.\nParticipants (N=79, 20% female, mean age 20.8) were assessed for readiness to quit smoking and assigned to one of 7 secret Facebook groups tailored to their stage of change. Daily postings to the groups based on TTM Decisional Balance and the 10 processes of change were made by research staff over 3 months. Engagement was operationalized as the number of participant comments to each post. TTM content-based predictors of number of comments were analyzed and stratified by baseline stage of change, using negative binomial regression analyses with and without zero inflation.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 512 TTM-based posts generated 630 individual comments. In Precontemplation and Contemplation groups, Decisional Balance posts generated above average engagement (P=.01 and P<.001). In Contemplation groups, posts based on the TTM processes Dramatic Relief and Self-Liberation resulted in below average engagement (P=.01 and P=.005). In Preparation groups, posts based on Consciousness Raising generated above average engagement (P=.009). Participant engagement decreased over time and differed between groups within Precontemplation and Contemplation stages, but was independent of day of the week and time of day the content was posted to the groups. No participant baseline characteristics significantly predicted engagement.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParticipants not ready to quit in the next 30 days (in Precontemplation or Contemplation) engaged most when prompted to think about the pros and cons of behavior change, while those in the Preparation stage engaged most when posts increased awareness about smoking and smoking cessation. Findings support tailoring intervention content to readiness to quit and suggest intervention components that may be most effective in generating high participant engagement on social media.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at how social media can be used to encourage young adults to quit smoking. Previous attempts to change people's behavior - like quitting smoking - through social media haven't been very successful because people didn't really engage with them. We're trying a new approach in this study, using a model that helps people to change their behavior and creating content on Facebook that suits each person's willingness to quit.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe aim of the study is to find out which content, based on this behavioral change model, gets the most responses from people who are thinking about quitting smoking, but haven't started the process yet.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe involved 79 people who smoke in the study (mostly men, with an average age of around 21 years old). They were assessed to find out how ready they were to quit smoking, then put into one of 7 private Facebook groups. These groups were tailored to their readiness to quit. A member of the research team would post daily content matching their readiness level for three months. We measured the success of the posts by how many comments they got.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe 512 posts got a total of 630 comments. For those who weren't planning on quitting within the month, posts asking them to weigh the pros and cons of changing their behavior got the most comments. For people who were getting ready to quit, posts raising awareness about smoking issues got the most comments. No matter what time or day the posts were published, the engagement levels dropped over time and varied between the different groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParticipants who weren't planning to quit anytime soon engaged the most with posts asking them to think about the good and bad sides of changing their behavior. Those getting ready to quit liked posts about facts related to smoking and how to quit. This supports the idea of using material based on how ready someone is to quit smoking. Certain types of content seem to work better in getting people engaged on social media."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2408, "completion_tokens": 613, "total_tokens": 3021}}
