This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

A prospective, controlled CPAP parallel study of new referrals with suspected OSAS randomized into group A) home-based or B) hospital-based approach. Following detection of AHI \u2265 15/hr by Embletta sleep study (group A) or polysomnography (group B), patients received CPAP for 3 months after an overnight autoCPAP titration at home or in hospital respectively. Modified intention-to-treat analysis of those with AHI \u2265 15/hr on CPAP (n = 86 vs 86) showed no difference in Epworth sleepiness score, the primary endpoint, but greater improvement in Sleep-Apnoea-Quality-of-Life-Index[difference 0.3,(95%CI 0.02, 0.6), p = 0.033] at 3 months in group A. The mean costs for the patients in group A and group B were HK$8479(989) and HK$22,248(2407) respectively. The mean difference between groups was HK$-13,769(USD 1770 equivalent) per patient with 95% CI. (\u221214324, \u221213213), p < 0.001. The waiting time of patients with AHI \u2265 15/hr who were started on CPAP treatment from the first clinic consultation to the diagnostic sleep test, autoCPAP titration, and CPAP treatment was 189.6, 148.8 and 145.0 days shorter in group A than group B respectively. Home-based approach is non-inferior to hospital-based approach in managing patients with suspected OSAS, with shorter waiting time, and substantial cost savings.\n\n## Simplification\nThis is a study comparing two ways of handling patients who might have Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS), which is a sleep disorder that causes your throat muscles to relax and block your airway during sleep. \n\nThe study had two groups. Group A patients were looked after at home. Group B patients were treated in a hospital. Both groups of patients were given CPAP, a machine used for treating sleep apnea, for three months. \n\nThe goal of the study was to see if there was a difference in the patients' sleepiness score but the study found no difference between the two groups. However, those treated at home reported a better improvement in their sleep quality and life quality.\n\nIn terms of cost and waiting time, the home-based approach was significantly better. It was cheaper by about USD 1770 per patient and also reduced waiting times by about 5-6 months from their first doctor visit to getting the CPAP machine.\n\nTherefore, this study suggests that treating patients with suspected OSAS at home can be as effective as treating them in the hospital. Plus it saves money and time.\n"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2081, "completion_tokens": 947, "total_tokens": 3028}}
