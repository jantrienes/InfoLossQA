Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study.

The aim of this study was to establish a standard chemoradiotherapy treatment regimen in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe CONVERT trial was an open-label, phase 3, randomised superiority trial. We enrolled adult patients (aged \u226518 years) who had cytologically or histologically confirmed limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0\u20132, and adequate pulmonary function. Patients were recruited from 73 centres in eight countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 45 Gy radiotherapy in 30 twice-daily fractions of 1\u00b75 Gy over 19 days, or 66 Gy in 33 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy over 45 days, starting on day 22 after commencing cisplatin\u2013etoposide chemotherapy (given as four to six cycles every 3 weeks in both groups). The allocation method used was minimisation with a random element, stratified by institution, planned number of chemotherapy cycles, and performance status. Treatment group assignments were not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time from randomisation until death from any cause, analysed by modified intention-to-treat. A 12% higher overall survival at 2 years in the once-daily group versus the twice-daily group was considered to be clinically significant to show superiority of the once-daily regimen. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00433563) and is currently in follow-up.\n\nFINDINGS.\nBetween April 7, 2008, and Nov 29, 2013, 547 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive twice-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (274 patients) or once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (273 patients). Four patients (one in the twice-daily group and three in the once-daily group) did not return their case report forms and were lost to follow-up; these patients were not included in our analyses. At a median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 35\u201358), median overall survival was 30 months (95% CI 24\u201334) in the twice-daily group versus 25 months (21\u201331) in the once-daily group (hazard ratio for death in the once daily group 1\u00b718 [95% CI 0\u00b795\u20131\u00b745]; p=0\u00b714). 2-year overall survival was 56% (95% CI 50\u201362) in the twice-daily group and 51% (45\u201357) in the once-daily group (absolute difference between the treatment groups 5\u00b73% [95% CI \u22123\u00b72% to 13\u00b77%]). The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse event in patients evaluated for chemotherapy toxicity was neutropenia (197 [74%] of 266 patients in the twice-daily group vs 170 [65%] of 263 in the once-daily group). Most toxicities were similar between the groups, except there was significantly more grade 4 neutropenia with twice-daily radiotherapy (129 [49%] vs 101 [38%]; p=0\u00b705). In patients assessed for radiotherapy toxicity, was no difference in grade 3\u20134 oesophagitis between the groups (47 [19%] of 254 patients in the twice-daily group vs 47 [19%] of 246 in the once-daily group; p=0\u00b785) and grade 3\u20134 radiation pneumonitis (4 [3%] of 254 vs 4 [2%] of 246; p=0\u00b770). 11 patients died from treatment-related causes (three in the twice-daily group and eight in the once-daily group).\n\nINTERPRETATION.\nSurvival outcomes did not differ between twice-daily and once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, and toxicity was similar and lower than expected with both regimens. Since the trial was designed to show superiority of once-daily radiotherapy and was not powered to show equivalence, the implication is that twice-daily radiotherapy should continue to be considered the standard of care in this setting.\n\nFUNDING.\nCancer Research UK (Clinical Trials Awards and Advisory Committee), French Ministry of Health, Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (Cancer Research Fund, Lung Cancer, and Radiation Oncology Groups).\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nThis study is about finding the best treatment plan for a type of lung cancer called limited-stage small-cell lung cancer. The usual treatment is a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but it's not clear what the best way to do this is.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a trial where we gave the same group of adults two types of treatment. Every patient in the trial had the same type of lung cancer. Some patients received radiotherapy two times a day for 19 days, while others received it once a day for 45 days. Everyone also got the same chemotherapy treatment at the same time. Our goal was to see who lived longer and also noticed the side effects in both groups.\n\nFINDINGS:\nWe started the trial in 2008 with 547 patients. We lost track of 4 patients so they weren't included in our results. After about four years, people who received radiotherapy twice a day lived about 30 months on average after being diagnosed, while people who received it once a day lived about 25 months. About 56% of patients who received radiotherapy twice daily were still alive two years after diagnosis, against 51% of those who got it once daily. The side effects were similar in both groups, just more patients in the twice-a-day group had a severe decrease in white blood cell count. On an unfortunate note, 11 patients died because of the treatment.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\nThe study found that giving the treatment twice a day or once a day didn't really make a difference in how long people lived. Also, the side effects were similar for both treatment plans. For now, we should continue giving radiotherapy twice a day as the standard treatment because we designed the trial aiming to prove once-daily treatment was superior.\n\nFUNDING:\nThis study was funded by several cancer research organizations and institutes from the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Europe."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2983, "completion_tokens": 1012, "total_tokens": 3995}}
