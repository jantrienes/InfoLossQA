This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

A total of 84 patients with ureteral calculi 5 to 10 mm in diameter were divided into two groups. Alfuzosin 10 mg (once daily) and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) were prescribed to group 1 (n=41), and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) only was prescribed to group 2 (n=44). The drug administration began immediately after ESWL and continued until stone expulsion was confirmed up to a maximum of 42 days after the procedure.\n\nRESULTS.\nThirty-nine of 41 (95.1%) patients in group 1 and 40 of 43 (93.0%) patients in group 2 ultimately passed stones (p=0.96). The number of ESWL sessions was 1.34\u00b10.65 and 1.41\u00b10.85 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.33). The patients who required analgesics after ESWL were 8 (19.5%) in group 1 and 13 (30.2%) in group 2 (p=0.31). Visual analogue scale pain severity scores were 5.33\u00b11.22 and 6.43\u00b11.36 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.056). The time to stone expulsion in groups 1 and 2 was 9.5\u00b14.8 days and 14.7\u00b19.8 days, respectively (p=0.005). No significant adverse effects occurred.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of alfuzosin in combination with ESWL seems to facilitate stone passage and to reduce the time of stone expulsion but does not affect the stone-free rate.\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE:\nWe studied whether the drug alfuzosin can help treat kidney stones that are less than 10 mm in size after a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe did a controlled, single-blind medical trial from June 2010 to August 2011. During this trial, 84 people with kidney stones that are 5 to 10 mm in size were randomly split into two groups. The first group was given alfuzosin and another drug called loxoprofen sodium. The second group only received loxoprofen sodium. The patients were given these drugs immediately after their ESWL procedure and treatment was continued until their kidney stones passed or up to six weeks after the procedure.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nIn the first group, 39 out of 41 patients (95.1%) passed their kidney stones, while in the second group, 40 out of 43 patients (93.0%) passed their stones. There wasn't a significant difference in the number of treatment sessions each group needed or in the number of patients that needed painkillers following treatment. However, the first group that received alfuzosin reported slightly less pain and passed their kidney stones about 5 days faster than the second group. We didn't notice any big negative side effects of the treatment. \n\nWHAT THIS MEANS:\nThis research suggests that using alfuzosin along with ESWL can make kidney stones pass quicker. However, it doesn't seem to affect the overall success rate, i.e., the chance of the kidney stone being completely removed."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2314, "completion_tokens": 492, "total_tokens": 2806}}
