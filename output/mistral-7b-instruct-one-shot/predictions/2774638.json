The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study.

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P < .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P < .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P < .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P < .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P < .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P < .001). Dairy was the primary calcium source for both groups (55% of intake for black women and 57% of intake for white women).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CFFFQ can be used to identify postmenopausal women with inadequate calcium intakes (<800 mg/d) and to identify key sources of dietary calcium. Older black women consume less daily calcium than do older white women.\n\n## Simplification\nINTRODUCTION:\nMore and more foods are being boosted with extra calcium. Because of this, it might be hard for traditional methods that measure how much calcium a person gets from their food to accurately work out how much they're really getting, especially if these methods are using off-the-shelf software. We wanted to create and test a special questionnaire that focused on calcium intake, which would also take into account foods naturally full of calcium and those that have extra calcium added to them. We also wanted to take a closer look at where black and white women going through menopause, in particular, get their calcium from and whether or not they're getting enough.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years. They were asked to recall everything they've eaten in the last 24 hours and then answer our 46-item special calcium questionnaire. \n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that the daily calcium intake measured by our questionnaire strongly matched with the 24-hour food recall. Interestingly, our questionnaire showed a higher total daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall. As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall underestimated the amount of calcium intake compared to our questionnaire. Our results also showed that dairy was the main source of calcium for both black and white women. Though our questionnaire estimated a higher amount of calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall, it was more accurate in identifying low calcium intakes.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur special questionnaire can be used to find out if women going through menopause are not getting enough calcium in their diet (less than 800 milligrams per day). Additionally, it can shed light on the main sources of dietary calcium. We also found that older black women tend to consume less daily calcium than older white women."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2452, "completion_tokens": 843, "total_tokens": 3295}}
