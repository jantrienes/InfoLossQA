The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Although citrulline contributes to the amelioration of atherosclerosis via endothelial nitric oxide production, it remains unclear whether it affects RCT. This study was undertaken to clarify the effects of citrulline on expressions of specific transporters such as ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 and ABCG1, and the cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I or HDL in vitro and ex vivo. Citrulline increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA and protein levels in THP-1 macrophages, translating into enhanced apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. In the human crossover study, 8 healthy male volunteers (age 30\u201349 years) consumed either 3.2 g/day citrulline or placebo for 1 week. Citrulline consumption brought about significant increases in plasma levels of citrulline and arginine. Supporting the in vitro data, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated under autologous post-citrulline sera demonstrated enhancement of both apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux through increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 expressions, compared to MDM differentiated under pre-citrulline sera. However, the placebo did not modulate these parameters. Therefore, in addition to improving endothelium function, citrulline might have an anti-atherogenic property by increasing RCT of HDL.\n\n## Simplification\nThe process of moving cholesterol from the body's tissues back to the liver, known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), is important for preventing heart disease. This study looks at how an amino acid, citrulline, might affect RCT.\n\nCitrulline is known to help reduce the risk of heart disease by supporting the production of a molecule, nitric oxide, which helps keep blood vessels healthy. However, we didn't know if citrulline could impact RCT. \n\nIn this study, we investigated if citrulline could influence some transport mechanisms related to RCT, specifically two proteins (ABCA1 and ABCG1) which help in the process. Also, we examined if citrulline had any effect on how well cholesterol is removed from immune cells (called macrophages) by a protein, apolipoprotein A-I, or by HDL (good cholesterol), both in the lab and in the human body. \n\nWe found that adding citrulline did increase the level of the two important proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1, in the macrophages. This led to better removal of cholesterol by apolipoprotein A-I and HDL. \n\nNext, we looked at people's response to citrulline. Eight healthy men, aged 30-49, were given either citrulline or a placebo (a substance with no effect) for a week. After consuming citrulline, their blood levels of citrulline and another amino acid, arginine, went up significantly. Checking their immune cells again, we saw that the cells were now better at releasing cholesterol, thanks to higher levels of those two proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1. No such changes were observed with the placebo.\n\nOur results suggest that, apart from helping blood vessels stay healthy, citrulline could also reduce the risk of heart disease by boosting the RCT process."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2250, "completion_tokens": 1379, "total_tokens": 3629}}
