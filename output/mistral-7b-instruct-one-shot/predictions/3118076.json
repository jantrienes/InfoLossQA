This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original Fragment: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification Fragment: null for Omissions OR <exact span in simplification> for Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly include the above elements.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Omissions\n- Original Fragment: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Simplification Fragment: null\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

They were divided into two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe results of this study indicated that flapless implant surgery using either immediately loading implants or DL implants, demonstrate enhancement of implant esthetics.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL AND PURPOSE.\nThe goal of this study was to understand how effective a specific type of dental implant surgery, known as flapless implant surgery, is in improving the appearance of the soft tissues in the mouth. We also compared the performance of two types of implants - ones that are immediately put to use (IL) versus those that are left to adjust for a while (DL).\n\nHOW WE DID THE STUDY.\nWe conducted this study with 20 patients who were missing some teeth in the front part of their upper mouth. We split them into two groups. In the first group (IL), we placed 10 implants that we immediately put to use and fitted with a permanent crown after 14 days. In the second group (DL), we placed 10 implants but only started using them after 4 months. We used different styles of implants for each group. To measure the outcome, we took note of various factors related to the soft tissues in the mouth at different times.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe success of first group was 80%, which was slightly less than the 90% success rate of the second group. However, when we compared the two, we found that the difference wasn't statistically significant. We also found no significant difference in most measurements of the soft tissues between the two groups over time. However, one measurement did increase significantly more in the second group compared to the first.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that flapless implant surgery, whether we start using the implants right away or after a delay, can help improve the appearance of the mouth."}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2157, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 2445}}
