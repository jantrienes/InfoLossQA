The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days.

Participants in the two groups were prescribed the same goals for energy intake (1250\u20131550 kcal per day) and physical activity (200 min per week).\n\nRESULTS.\nWhile both groups produced significant improvements in weight and HbA1c after 6 months of treatment, PCD participants lost 7.3 kg [95% confidence interval (CI): \u22125.8 to \u22128.8 kg], compared with 2.2 kg (95% CI: \u22120.7 to \u22123.7 kg) in the DSME group (P<0.0001). Significantly more PCD than DSME participants lost \u2a7e5% of initial weight (54.0% vs 14.0%, P<0.0001) and \u2a7e10% (26.0% vs 6.0%, P<0.0001). HbA1c declined by 0.7% (95% CI: \u22120.4 to \u22121.0%) in the PCD group, compared with 0.4% (95% CI: \u22120.1 to \u22120.7%) in DSME (P<0.026). Across both groups, larger weight losses were associated with greater reductions in HbA1c (r=0.52, P<0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese findings demonstrate that a commercially available portion-controlled meal plan can induce clinically meaningful improvements in weight and glycemic control in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. These data have implications for the management of obesity in primary care, as now provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n### Simplification\nOBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this study is to see how effective a ready-to-eat, portion-controlled diet is on weight and blood sugar levels over six months in overweight patients with Type 2 diabetes.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe had 100 participants on average about 55 years old, weighing about 102.9 kilos, with a blood sugar level of 7.7%. They were placed randomly into two groups. One group used the portion-controlled diet as part of a nine-session lifestyle program, while the other group had a nine-session program focused on teaching them to manage Type-2 diabetes. Both groups had the same goals for daily calorie intake (1250-1550 calories) and weekly exercise (200 minutes).\n\nRESULTS\nOn the whole, both groups improved in weight and blood sugar levels after 6 months. However, those on the portion-controlled diet lost an average of 7.3 kilos compared to 2.2 kilos in the diabetes management group. More people in the portion-controlled diet group lost at least 5% of their starting weight and 10% of their starting weight. Blood sugar levels also decreased more in the portion-controlled group compared to the diabetes management group. Across both groups, the more weight lost, the better the decrease in blood sugar levels.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings show that ready-to-eat, portion-controlled meals can significantly improve weight and blood sugar control in overweight people with Type 2 diabetes. These results matter to doctors and health services who want to help patients deal with being overweight.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
