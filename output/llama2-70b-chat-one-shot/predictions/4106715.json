The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (N=301 smokers) tested 200 and 400 \u03bcg doses administered 4 or 5 times over 6 months compared to placebo. 3'AmNic-rEPA recipients with the highest serum anti-nicotine antibody response (top 30% by AUC) were significantly more likely to attain 8 weeks continuous abstinence from weeks 19 through 26 than the placebo recipients (24.6% vs. 12.0%, p=0.024, OR=2.69, 95% CI, 1.14\u20136.37). The 5 injection 400 \u03bcg dose regimen had the greatest antibody response and had significantly higher abstinence rates than placebo. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept that 3'AmNic-rEPA elicits antibodies to nicotine and is associated with higher continuous abstinence rates, justifying its further development as a treatment for nicotine dependence.\n\n### Simplification\nScientists have been testing a new nicotine vaccine, called NicVAX\u00ae, to see if it can help smokers quit. They wanted to know if more of the vaccine in the body leads to better quit rates and if giving more doses of the vaccine increases its effectiveness.\n\nThey conducted a study with 301 smokers, where some received either 200 or 400 \u03bcg doses of the vaccine, four or five times over six months, and others received a fake form of the vaccine (placebo). They found out that those who had the most significant immune response to the vaccine (the top 30%) were more likely to quit smoking for at least eight weeks compared to those who took the placebo (24.6% vs. 12.0%).\n\nInterestingly, those who had the regimen of five shots of the higher dose (400 \u03bcg) were more likely to quit smoking than the placebo group too.\n\nSo, this study shows that NicVAX\u00ae can stimulate the body to produce nicotine antibodies and help smokers quit. This encourages further research to develop the vaccine as a potential treatment for nicotine addiction.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
