The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Totaly 120 cases enrolled were randomly assigned to a lateral decubitus position group and supine position group. The hospital stay, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, length of incision, X-ray fluoroscopy time, and out-of-bed activity time in the lateral decubitus position group were significantly lower than those in the supine position group. There was not statistical significance on union time and Harris values in the two position groups. Moreover, only complications of superficial wound infection were observed in the lateral decubitus position group, but two complications of deep venous thrombosis and wound deep infection were found in the supine position group. The present findings suggested that PFNA applied in elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture can get satisfactory effects, and the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures using lateral decubitus position showed a satisfactory clinical outcome and a lower radiological complication rate.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study aimed to compare how effective two different positions (lateral decubitus or on their side, and supine or laying flat on their back) were during a hip fracture treatment called Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) in 120 elderly Chinese patients. \n\nIn simple terms, these patients were randomly divided into two groups and treated while in different positions. Measures they looked at included the patients' length of hospital stay, surgery time, blood loss during surgery, size of the surgical cut, length of time the X-ray was used during surgery, and the time it took for patients to get out of bed after surgery. \n\nResults showed that all these were significantly less in the group that had surgery while lying on their side compared to those who had surgery while lying flat on their back. However, they also found there was no major difference between the groups regarding the time it took for the fracture to heal and the overall hip health after surgery.\n\nNotably, they found fewer complications in the group that had surgery while lying on their side. Only surface wound infections were noticed in this group, while the group who had surgery while lying on their back experienced more severe issues such as deep vein blood clots and deep wound infections.\n\nOverall, their findings suggest that PFNA treatment can be effective for elderly patients with this type of hip fracture, and having the surgery while lying on one's side may lead to better results and fewer complications.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
