The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

If cervical ripening using a prostaglandin is required, a pre-labour overnight hospitalisation and separation from family and support companions is necessary. Recent evidence shows that balloon catheter cervical ripening is just as effective as prostaglandins, but does not cause uterine stimulation. For women with low risk pregnancies, this offers the possibility of undergoing the overnight ripening process in their own home. We conducted a pilot randomised trial to assess the outcomes, clinical pathways and acceptability to both women and clinicians of outpatient balloon catheter ripening compared with usual inpatient care.\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-eight women with low risk term pregnancies were randomised (2:1) to either outpatient (n = 33) or inpatient double-balloon catheter (n = 15) cervical ripening. Although not powered for statistically significant differences, the study explored potential direction of effect for key clinical outcomes such as oxytocin use, caesarean section and morbidities. Feedback on acceptability was sought from women at catheter insertion and 4 weeks after the birth, and from midwives and doctors, at the end of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nClinical and perinatal outcomes were similar. Most women required oxytocin (77 %). The outpatient group were 24 % less likely to require oxytocin (risk difference \u221223.6 %, 95 % CI \u221243.8 to \u22123.5). There were no failed inductions, infections or uterine hyperstimulation attributable to the catheter in either group. Most women in both groups reported discomfort with insertion and wearing the catheter, but were equally satisfied with their care and felt the baby was safe (91 % both groups). Outpatient women reported feeling less isolated or emotionally alone. Most midwives and doctors (n = 90) agreed that they are more comfortable in sending home a woman with a catheter than prostaglandins and 90 % supported offering outpatient ripening to eligible women.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient balloon catheter ripening should be further investigated as an option for women in an adequately powered randomised trial.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nProspectively registered, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612001184864.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nIn Australia, one out of four births are induced, or started artificially. Usually, this requires a woman to stay in a hospital overnight for a procedure involving a hormone called prostaglandin. However, new studies show that a balloon catheter, a tube with an inflatable section, can also be used for something called cervical ripening and is just as effective as prostaglandins. The bonus is that it doesn't cause stimulation of the womb. For low-risk pregnancies, this method allows women to have the procedure at home. We conducted an initial small-scale study to compare this at-home method with the usual in-hospital procedure in terms of results, how it's done, and how acceptable it is to both women and clinicians.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had 48 women with low-risk pregnancies take part in the study. Two thirds of them tried the at-home method while one third stayed in the hospital. We looked at a few key things, like whether labor-inducing drugs were needed, if a C-section was performed, and any health problems. We also got feedback on how acceptable this procedure was both from women and healthcare professionals.\n\nRESULTS.\nOutcomes for mother and baby were similar in both groups. Most women, 77%, needed labor-inducing drugs. However, the group at home was 24% less likely to need these drugs. There were no treatment failures, infections, or over-stimulation of the womb in either group. Most women reported discomfort with the balloon catheter but were equally satisfied overall. They felt their baby was safe and experienced less loneliness. Healthcare professionals were more comfortable with sending a woman home with a balloon catheter than prostaglandins, and most agreed they would offer the at-home method to eligible women.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study suggests that, for inducing labor, the at-home method using a balloon catheter deserves further investigation. It should be studied in a larger, more accurate trial.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in advance at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
