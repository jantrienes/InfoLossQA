The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 20 patients each. Patients of group A were administered bimatoprost 0.03% eye drops once daily, and those of group B brimonidine 0.2% eye drops twice daily for a period of 4 weeks. After a washout period of 4 weeks, the patients were crossed over that is, group A was administered brimonidine 0.2% and group B bimatoprost 0.03%. Fall in IOP at 4 weeks was recorded. The daily cost of each drug was calculated by maximum retail price and the average number of drops per bottle. The cost-effectiveness was then calculated as the cost of drug/mm Hg fall in IOP.\n\nSTATISTICS.\nIndependent samples t-test was used to compare the efficacy of both drugs.\n\nRESULTS.\nIOP lowering with bimatoprost (8.9 \u00b1 1.598 mm Hg) was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than brimonidine (6.55 \u00b1 1.26 mm Hg). The number of drops/ml were 33.43 \u00b1 0.52 and 25.49 \u00b1 0.26, respectively, for bimatoprost and brimonidine. Treatment with bimatoprost was costlier than brimonidine with daily costs/eye Rs. 4.02 \u00b1 0.06 and 3.14 \u00b1 0.03, yearly costs/eye Rs. 1467.46 \u00b1 20.74 and 1147.75 \u00b1 11.15, respectively. Bimatoprost was more cost-effective than brimonidine with the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) respectively Rs. 13.10 \u00b1 2.61/mm Hg and Rs. 13.96 \u00b1 2.86/mm Hg. Incremental CER Rs. 10.43/mm Hg implies lower costs/mm Hg extra IOP lowering by bimatoprost than Rs. 13.96 for brimonidine.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn spite of being costlier, bimatoprost is more efficacious and cost-effective than brimonidine.\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL:\nWe wanted to see if two particular eye drops, bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2%, work well and are good value for money for people with a specific eye condition causing increased eye pressure (called primary open-angle glaucoma) or high eye pressure (ocular hypertension).\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe carried out a study involving 40 volunteers who had these conditions but only mild eye pressure. We randomly divided them into two different groups. Half of them were given bimatoprost drops once a day, while the other half used brimonidine drops twice a day, for a month. After resting for a month, we switched the groups: the first group started using brimonidine, and the second group used bimatoprost. We recorded the drop in eye pressure after a month for both groups. We then calculated the cost per day of both treatments, and how much it cost per unit of pressure dropped (cost-effectiveness).\n\nHOW WE FIGURED OUT THE RESULTS:\nWe used a common statistical method to compare how effective both drugs were.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that bimatoprost was significantly more effective, reducing eye pressure more than brimonidine. However, bimatoprost was also more expensive on a per drop basis than brimonidine. Despite the higher price, when looking at the cost in relation to how much it lowers eye pressure, bimatoprost ended up being a more cost-effective option than brimonidine.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAlthough it's a bit more expensive, bimatoprost is more effective and gives you more bang for your buck than brimonidine when it comes to treating these eye conditions.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
