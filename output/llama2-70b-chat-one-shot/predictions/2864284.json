The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Chloroquine resistance in P. vivax is emerging in Asia. Therapeutic responses across Afghanistan have not been evaluated in detail.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween July 2007 and February 2009, an open-label, randomized controlled trial of chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in patients aged three months and over with slide-confirmed P. vivax mono-infections was conducted. Consistent with current national guidelines, primaquine was not administered. Subjects were followed up daily during the acute phase of illness (days 0-3) and weekly until day 56. The primary endpoint was the overall cumulative parasitological failure rate at day 56 after the start of treatment, with the hypothesis being that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was non-inferior compared to chloroquine (\u0394 = 5% difference in proportion of failures).\n\nRESULTS.\nOf 2,182 individuals with positive blood films for P. vivax, 536 were enrolled in the trial. The day 28 cure rate was 100% in both treatment groups. Parasite clearance was more rapid with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine than chloroquine. At day 56, there were more recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm (8.9%, 95% CI 6.0-13.1%) than the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-5.8%), a difference in cumulative recurrence rate of 6.1% (2-sided 90%CI +2.6 to +9.7%). The log-rank test comparing the survival curves confirmed the superiority of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over chloroquine (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that a lower initial haemoglobin concentration was also independently associated with recurrence. Both regimens were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nChloroquine remains an efficacious treatment for the treatment of vivax malaria in Afghanistan. In a setting where radical therapy cannot be administered, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine provides additional benefit in terms of post-treatment prophylaxis, reducing the incidence of recurrence from 4-8 weeks after treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT00682578.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nIn Afghanistan, the standard treatment for most cases of malaria (a disease caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite) is a drug called chloroquine. But some malaria parasites in Asia are becoming resistant to this drug. The effectiveness of the drug in Afghanistan hasn't been extensively tested.\n\nMETHODS.\nFrom July 2007 to February 2009, we ran a study on patients who were at least three months old and had malaria. We tested the effect of chloroquine and another drug called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. We checked them daily at first, then weekly for eight weeks. We saw which treatment was better at preventing the malaria parasite from returning.\n\nRESULTS.\nOut of 2,182 people with malaria that we found, 536 took part in the test. After four weeks, everyone in both treatment groups was cured. But we saw that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine cured the disease faster. After eight weeks, fewer people in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group got sick again. Both treatments were safe and didn\u2019t make anyone seriously ill.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe chloroquine drug is still good for treating malaria in Afghanistan. The alternative drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine can also give extra protection stopping the disease from coming back.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nWe registered this trial online at ClinicalTrials.gov, where it is registered under the number NCT00682578.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
