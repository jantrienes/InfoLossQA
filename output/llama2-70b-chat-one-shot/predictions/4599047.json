The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Patients were treated between June 2008 and December 2011 at 31 investigational sites. Three hundred ninety-one subjects were included in the randomized study group consisting of 190 Superion\u00ae and 201 X-STOP\u00ae control subjects. The primary composite endpoint was individual patient success based on four components: improvement in two of three domains of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire, no reoperations at the index level, no major implant/procedure-related complications, and no clinically significant confounding treatments.\n\nRESULTS.\nAt 3 years, the proportion of subjects achieving the primary composite endpoint was greater for Superion\u00ae (63/120, 52.5%) than for X-STOP\u00ae (49/129, 38.0%) (P=0.023) and the corresponding success rates exceeded 80% for each of the individual components of the primary endpoint in the Superion\u00ae group (range: 81%\u201391%). Improvements in back and leg pain severity as well as back- and disease-specific functional outcomes were also maintained through 36 months.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe 3-year outcomes from this randomized controlled trial demonstrate durable clinical improvement consistently across all clinical outcomes for the Superion\u00ae in the treatment of patients with moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\n### Simplification\nPURPOSE:\nThis report talks about a 3-year study conducted on a treatment device named Superion\u00ae. The device was used for patients dealing with moderate lower back spinal degeneration, which was approved for testing by the US Food and Drug Administration. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nPeople aged 45 years and above, suffering from moderate lower back spinal degeneration, were tested using the Superion\u00ae device. This was done between 2008 and 2011 at 31 different testing sites. In total, 391 people participated in the study. These included 190 patients treated with Superion\u00ae and 201 others who were given an alternative, X-STOP\u00ae, for comparison. The success of the treatment was judged based on improvements in patients in various areas, no repeat operations, no severe complications from the implant or procedure, and no significant additional treatments needed.\n\nRESULTS:\nThree years after treatment, a larger percentage of the Superion\u00ae treated patients showed successful recovery (around 52.5%) compared to those with X-STOP\u00ae (around 38%). For each separate aspect of recovery, over 80% of the Superion\u00ae patients showed improvements. These patients also maintained less severity of back and leg pain, and better back-functioning and disease-related outcomes over the 36 months.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe study results, after three years, consistently show the Superion\u00ae device to be effective in treating patients with moderate lower back spinal degeneration. The positive outcomes remained stable throughout the time-frame.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. Annotate the sample above. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.
