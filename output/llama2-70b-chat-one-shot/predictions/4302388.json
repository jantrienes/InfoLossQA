The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

In the present study, we evaluated Se status in UK pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 UK primiparous women to treatment with Se (60 \u03bcg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. UK pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than US women, GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women, and low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3\u00b700, range 0\u00b790\u20135\u00b780 mg/l). Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0\u00b7040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0\u00b7054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0\u00b738, 95 % CI 0\u00b717, 0\u00b787, P= 0\u00b7021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0\u00b730, 95 % CI 0\u00b709, 1\u00b700, P= 0\u00b7049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH. Therefore, UK women of childbearing age need to improve their Se status.\n\n### Simplification\nThis abstract is about a study that explored the connection between a mineral called selenium (Se) and high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy, specifically, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and pre-eclampsia (PE). Mothers-to-be who consume inadequate amounts of selenium may be more likely to develop these conditions.\n\nThe study involved 230 first-time mothers in the UK who were randomly chosen to either receive a selenium supplement or a placebo from the 12th week of pregnancy onwards. Researchers took multiple measurements and assessments related to the women's selenium levels throughout the pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers found that the selenium levels of pregnant women in the UK were lower compared to those of pregnant women in other countries. Factors like age, level of education, and social class positively impacted selenium levels. Women who ate Brazil nuts or consumed more than two seafood servings a week also showed higher selenium levels. \n\nThe research revealed that the lower the selenium level in the toenails (which is an indicator of the body's selenium status), the higher the chances were for a woman to develop PIH or PE. Women who took the selenium supplement were found to be less at risk of developing these conditions.\n\nTo sum up, the study concluded that women in the UK planning to have children should increase their selenium intake, as low levels of this mineral may increase their chances of developing PIH or PE.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
