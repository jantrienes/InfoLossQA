The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

We hypothesized that vitamin D3 supplementation would ameliorate FLS by decreasing related serum cytokines\u2019 levels.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a randomized, double blind study of 45 IFN\u03b2-treated PwMS, 21 patients were assigned to 800\u00a0IU of vitamin D3 per day (low dose), while 24 patients received 4,370\u00a0IU per day (high dose) for one year. FLS were assessed monthly by telephonic interviews. Serum levels of 25-hydroxy-D (25-OH-D), calcium, PTH, IL-17, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 were measured periodically. EDSS, relapses, adverse events and quality of life (QoL) were documented.\n\nRESULTS.\n25-OH-D levels increased to a significantly higher levels and PTH levels decreased in the high dose group. There was no significant change in FLS. IL-17 levels were significantly increased in the low dose group, while patients receiving high dose vitamin D had a heterogeneous IL-17 response. No significant differences in relapse rate, EDSS, QoL, serum IL-10 and IFN\u03b3 were found. Hypercalcemia or other potential major adverse events were not observed.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nVitamin D supplementation to IFN\u2212\u03b2 treated PwMS, at the doses used, seems safe and associated with dose-dependent changes in IL-17 serum levels, while not affecting IFN\u2212\u03b2 related FLS.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01005095\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nPeople with Multiple Sclerosis often get flu-like symptoms when receiving a treatment called interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2). There seems to be a link with a spike in certain proteins (cytokines) in the blood after the injection. We think taking Vitamin D3 might help reduce these flu-like symptoms by lowering the levels of these proteins in the blood.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe ran a study with 45 people who were being treated for their Multiple Sclerosis with IFN-\u03b2. Half of them were given a small dose of Vitamin D3 each day and the other half were given a larger dose, every day for a year. We checked in with them regularly via phone to see if they were having flu-like symptoms. We also checked certain things in their blood and noted any relapses or changes in the quality of their life.\n\nRESULTS.\nPeople who took the higher dose of Vitamin D3 had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood and lower levels of a certain hormone. However, we didn't see any major change in their flu-like symptoms. In the low dose group, levels of a certain protein (IL-17) rose significantly. No major changes were found in other factors we were monitoring, such as relapse rate and quality of life. We also didn't observe any serious side effects from the vitamin D supplementation.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIt seems safe for people receiving IFN-\u03b2 treatment for their Multiple Sclerosis to take Vitamin D supplements. The dose does measurably impact levels of the protein IL-17, but it doesn't seem to affect the flu-like symptoms related to the IFN-\u03b2 treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis clinical trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the ID: NCT01005095.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
