The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8\u201318.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3\u201318 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C >6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000\u201310,000, platelets >100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n\nRESULTS.\nA1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 \u00b1 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 \u00b1 1.2%; P < 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 \u00b1 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 \u00b1 0.21; P < 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P < 0.05). From baseline to week 24 insulin dose decreased 18% in the etanercept group compared with a 23% increase in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of \u03b2-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL.\nThe goal of this study was to test if a drug called etanercept could help children with newly detected type 1 diabetes continue making their own insulin for longer.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN. \nThis was a six-month experiment carried out at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo's Diabetes Center. A diverse group of 18 kids aged between 7.8-18.2 years participated. They were randomly split into two groups. One group received etanercept, and the other got a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect). The researchers used standard criteria, including age, health status, insulin injections, and general health markers to select the participants. They treated all participants equally whether they finished the study or not.\n\nFINDINGS. \nAt the end of the study, the group that received etanercept had a lower average blood sugar level and seemed to be making more of their own insulin than the placebo group. Their average insulin dose decreased by 18%, while the placebo group's average dose increased by 23%. Importantly, none of the patients dropped out due to side effects from the etanercept.\n\nCONCLUSIONS. \nThis small preliminary study suggests that etanercept might help children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes maintain their ability to produce insulin. Therefore, etanercept might delay the point at which patients need to rely entirely on insulin injections. More extensive research is needed to confirm this possibility and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.

Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other.
