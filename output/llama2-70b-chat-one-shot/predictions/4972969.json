The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

We tested the effects of OSS on workload and 12 facility performance indicators for emergency triage assessment and treatment, HIV testing, and malaria and pneumonia case management among outpatients by two subgroups: 1) mid-level practitioners (MLP) who attended IMID training (IMID-MLP) and 2) health workers who did not (No-IMID).\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-six health facilities participated in the IDCAP trial, with 18 randomly assigned to Arm A and 18 to Arm B. Two MLP in both arms received IMID. All providers at Arm A facilities received nine monthly OSS visits from April to December 2010 while Arm B did not. From November 2009 to December 2010, 777,667 outpatient visits occurred. We analyzed 669,580 (86.1 %) outpatient visits, where provider cadre was reported. Treatment was provided by 64 IMID-MLP and 1,515 No-IMID providers. The effect of OSS was measured by the difference in pre/post changes across arms after controlling for covariates (adjusted ratio of relative risks = a RRR).\n\nRESULTS.\nThe effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among IMID-MLP (aRRR = 1.21; p = 0.48) and No-IMID (aRRR = 0.90; p = 0.44) was not statistically significant. Among IMID-MLP, OSS was effective for three indicators: malaria cases receiving an appropriate antimalarial (aRRR = 1.26, 99 % CI = 1.02-1.56), patients with negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial (aRRR = 0.49, 99 % CI = 0.26-0.92), and patients with acid-fast bacilli smear negative result receiving empiric treatment for acute respiratory infection (aRRR = 2.04, 99 % CI = 1.06-3.94). Among No-IMID, OSS was effective for two indicators: emergency and priority patients admitted, detained or referred (aRRR = 2.12, 99 % CI = 1.05-4.28) and emergency patients receiving at least one appropriate treatment (aRRR = 1.98, 99 % CI = 1.21-3.24).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nEffects of OSS on workload were not statistically significant. Significant OSS effects on facility performance across subgroups were heterogeneous. OSS supported MLP who diagnosed and treated patients to apply IMID knowledge. For other providers, OSS supported team work to manage emergency patients. This evidence on OSS effectiveness could inform interventions to improve health workers' capacity to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article 10.1186/s12889-016-3375-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was about how we can improve how health workers diagnose and treat infectious diseases. We tried two different methods: a special classroom training that covered all aspects of managing infectious diseases, and on-the-job, hands-on guidance. The aim was to see if the hands-on guidance, or On-Site Support (OSS), made a difference in how health workers handled emergency cases, HIV testing, and treatment of malaria and pneumonia patients. Specifically, we wanted to compare how health workers who had gone through the classroom training performed against those who hadn't.\n\nMETHODS.\n36 health facilities took part in the study, split evenly into two groups. Two health workers from each group were chosen to go through the special classroom training. Everyone in one group got hands-on guidance for nine months, while the other group did not. We analyzed almost a year's worth of outpatient visits (over 669,000) in which the care provider was mentioned, to see what effect the hands-on guidance had.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that having on-site guidance didn't significantly change the number of patients a health worker saw each day. But for health workers who had been through the classroom training, the guidance helped in three areas: treating malaria correctly, not prescribing antimalarial drugs if a test was negative, and treating respiratory infections in people who tested negative for tuberculosis. For health workers who hadn't been through the special classroom training, the guidance was helpful in managing emergency patients better.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWhile on-site guidance didn't change how many patients a healthcare worker saw, it did show positive effects on how they managed patients, especially in emergency situations. This sort of hands-on guidance seems to help health workers use their training better, and improve care. These findings could help improve interventions to improve the capacity of health workers to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nThere is more material related to this study available online for those with proper authorization.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
