The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

A demographic checklist and a standard questionnaire covering health-promoting lifestyle, health-related QoL, self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers dimensions were used to gather required data. Independent-samples t test, paired-samples t-test, and ANCOVA were used to analyze the data.\n\nRESULTS.\nAnalysis of covariance showed that after adjusting for effects of pretest scores, the difference between mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender's health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers) in the intervention group 1 and control group were significant (P< 0.0001). In addition, changes in mean scores of lifestyle scale (42.4 \u00b1 13.6), QoL scale (29.1 \u00b1 14.2), self-efficacy (16.1 \u00b1 2.6), perceived affect (16.1 \u00b1 8), social support (35.4 \u00b1 12.4), and barriers (17.2 \u00b1 15.8) before and after intervention were significant in the intervention group 2 (P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nApplication of family-centered empowerment model among methamphetamine users and their families is practically feasible and can result in enhancement and improvement of their QoL, lifestyle, and health promotion model constructs.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nThis study looks at how involving families in the treatment process can help drug users get better, experience fewer side effects, and improve their quality of life.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nThe aim was to see if educating drug users and their families, using methods grounded in empowerment and health promotion, could enhance their lifestyles and improve their overall health.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nWe tested this on drug users who were getting treatment at a medical center in Tehran. They were split up into three groups: one group of the drug users themselves, one group of their family members, and a third control group. We asked them a series of questions about their lifestyle, health, self confidence, emotions, social support, and potential obstacles.\n\nRESULTS:\nAfter adjusting for previous test scores, there was a significant improvement in the lifestyle, health, and other areas for the drug users and their families who went through the empowerment program. The control group didn't see these changes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nUsing a family-centered empowerment approach with drug users and their families is possible and can lead to better health, improved lifestyle, and more positive attitudes towards health.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.

Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other.
