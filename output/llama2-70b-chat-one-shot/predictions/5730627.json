The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score changes from baseline (primary endpoint) at week 8 (flexible-dose study) or week 6 (forced-dose study) were assessed with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Improvement scale (CGI-I; key secondary endpoint) and changes from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV subscales. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.\n\nRESULTS.\nLeast squares (LS) mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment were \u221217.0 \u00b1 1.03 with placebo, \u221225.4 \u00b1 0.74 with LDX, and \u221222.1 \u00b1 0.73 with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study and \u221213.4 \u00b1 1.19 with placebo, \u221225.6 \u00b1 0.82 with LDX, and \u221223.5 \u00b1 0.80 with OROS-MPH in the flexible-dose study. LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment difference for the change from baseline significantly favored LDX over OROS-MPH in the forced-dose [\u22123.4 \u00b1 1.04, p = 0.0013, effect size (ES) \u22120.33] but not the flexible-dose (\u22122.1 \u00b1 1.15, p = 0.0717, ES \u22120.20) study. The percentage of improved participants on the dichotomized CGI-I at end of treatment was significantly greater with LDX than with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study (81.4 vs. 71.3%, p = 0.0188) but not the flexible-dose study (LDX 83.1%, OROS-MPH 81.0%, p = 0.6165). The LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment differences for change from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales nominally favored LDX in the forced-dose study (hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.49, nominal p = 0.0081, ES \u22120.27; inattentiveness subscale \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.63, nominal p = 0.0013, ES \u22120.33), but there were no significant differences between active treatments in the flexible-dose study. In both studies, LDX and OROS-MPH were superior to placebo for all efficacy-related endpoints (all nominal p < 0.0001; ES range \u22120.43 to \u22121.16). The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX and OROS-MPH, respectively, were 66.5 and 58.9% in the forced-dose study and 83.2 and 82.1% in the flexible-dose study. TEAEs occurring in \u2265 5% of participants that were also reported at two or more times the rate of placebo were decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, initial insomnia, dry mouth, and nasopharyngitis (LDX and OROS-MPH), irritability and dizziness (LDX only), and increased heart rate (OROS-MPH only) in the forced-dose study and decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, and dizziness (LDX and OROS-MPH) and dry mouth and upper abdominal pain (LDX only) in the flexible-dose study. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) increases from baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) were observed in the forced-dose study [LDX 1.6 \u00b1 9.65 and 3.3 \u00b1 8.11 mmHg, 6.7 \u00b1 12.78 beats per minute (bpm); OROS-MPH 2.6 \u00b1 10.15 and 3.3 \u00b1 9.13 mmHg, 7.6 \u00b1 12.47 bpm] and the flexible-dose study (LDX 2.4 \u00b1 9.46 and 2.8 \u00b1 8.41 mmHg, 4.7 \u00b1 11.82 bpm; OROS-MPH 0.4 \u00b1 9.90 and 2.2 \u00b1 8.64 mmHg, 6.0 \u00b1 10.52 bpm) at the last on-treatment assessment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLDX was superior to OROS-MPH in adolescents with ADHD in the forced-dose but not the flexible-dose study. Safety and tolerability for both medications was consistent with previous studies.

The study particularly compares two drugs: lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH).\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nWe studied and compared the effects of LDX and OROS-MPH on ADHD symptoms in teenagers.\n\nMETHODS.\nTeenagers diagnosed with ADHD participated in two separate studies. In one 8-week study, the dose was flexible and in another 6-week study, the dose was fixed. We measured the changes in their ADHD symptoms at the end of each study. We also tracked any side effects as well as their vital signs.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe results showed that both LDX and OROS-MPH improved ADHD symptoms more than a placebo (a dummy pill). But, LDX had a slightly better result in the fixed-dose study, whereas in the flexible-dose study, there wasn't much difference between LDX and OROS-MPH. We also found common side effects, including loss of appetite, weight loss, sleep problems, dry mouth, and minor infections. The drugs also slightly increased blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings show that LDX was more effective than OROS-MPH in the fixed-dose study, but not in the flexible-dose study. Both drugs were safe and similar findings have been reported in previous studies. Both types of drugs were effective in treating ADHD symptoms in teenagers.\n\nACCESS TO MORE MATERIAL.\nYou can find additional material related to this article online if you're authorized.
