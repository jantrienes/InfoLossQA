The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

About 10,000 infants with Thalassemia major are born every year. The present study was under taken with a hope to prevail better quality of life to the Thalassemic patients. Pallor being the chief complaint, a randomized controlled trial was undertaken with Dhatri Avaleha as it is specially mentioned for Pandu, Kamala & Haleemaka Roga. Children between age group of 1 to 15 years were randomly divided in two groups: Drug treated group (Group A) and Control group (Group B). Assessment was done on subjective and objective parameters after 30 and 60 days of treatment with follow up of two month. Statistically significant (P<0.01) result was obtained in Blood transfusion interval in group 'A' in comparison to group 'B'. Dhatri Avaleha may have a potential to increase blood transfusion interval and decrease secondary infection and thus it can be used as supportive therapy with modern medical management.\n\n### Simplification\nThalassemia is the most common genetic disease in India, with around 10,000 babies born each year with severe Thalassemia. This study was done to try improve the quality of life for people living with Thalassemia. The main symptom these patients suffer is pallor, or paleness. \n\nThey used a traditional Indian medicine called Dhatri Avaleha, known for treating conditions like anemia, jaundice, and liver disease. The study involved children aged between 1 to 15 years old. They were split into two groups. Group A received the Dhatri Avaleha treatment, and Group B did not.\n\nThe children were monitored before treatment, after 30 days of treatment, after 60 days of treatment, and for two months after the treatment. The results showed that the children who took Dhatri Avaleha (Group A) could go longer without needing a blood transfusion than the children who didn't take the medicine (Group B).\n\nWhat this means is that Dhatri Avaleha could potentialy be used to lengthen the time between blood transfusions and lower the chance of secondary infections. This suggests it could be a good extra treatment to use alongside regular medical care for Thalassemia.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
