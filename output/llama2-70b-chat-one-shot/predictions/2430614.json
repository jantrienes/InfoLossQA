The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD) was a potential alternative for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. A comparison of the efficacy and safety of these three drug combinations was necessary to make evidence based drug treatment policies.\n\nMETHODS.\nFive hundred and thirty-four, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal children were randomised in blocks of 15 to the AS+AQ, AL or AS+CD groups. Administration of study drugs was supervised by project staff and the children were followed up at r home on days 1,2,3,7,14 and 28 post treatment. Parasitological and clinical failures and adverse events were compared between the study groups.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS.\nIn a per-protocol analysis, the parasitological and clinical failure rate at day 28 post treatment (PCF28) was lower in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or AS+CD groups (corrected for re-infections: 6.6% vs 13.8% and 13.8% respectively, p = 0.08; uncorrected: 14.6% vs 27.6% and 28.1% respectively, p = 0.005). In the intention to treat analysis, the rate of early treatment failure was high in all three groups (AS+AQ 13.3%; AL 15.2%; and AS+CD 9.3%, p = 0.2) primarily due to vomiting. However, the PCF28 corrected for re-infection was lower, though not significantly, in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or the AS+CD groups (AS+AQ 18.3%; AL 24.2%; AS+CD 20.8%, p = 0.4) The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAS+AQ is an appropriate first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Ghana and possibly in the neighbouring countries in West Africa. The effectiveness of AL in routine programme conditions needs to be studied further in West Africa.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00119145\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study is about comparing three different drug combinations used to treat uncomplicated malaria. These combinations are Artesunate+amodiaquine (AS+AQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), and Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD). Comparing the effectiveness and safety of these treatments will help make decisions about which medication to recommend for treating malaria.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested these three combinations on 534 children who were otherwise healthy. The children were divided into three groups, each receiving one of the drug combinations. They were watched closely by our project staff who delivered the medicines. We checked on them several times after the treatment - 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days later. We were looking for whether the medication failed to get rid of the malaria, and if any child had negative side effects from the medication.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS.\nWhen comparing the results, less children in the AS+AQ group had failed treatments and signs of malaria compared to the other two groups. However, many children in all three groups threw up after taking the medication. It should be noted that the AS+AQ group's treatment failure rate was lower, though not significantly. It also helps to know, the overall rate of side effects was similar in all groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBased on our findings, AS+AQ seems to be a suitable first choice for treating uncomplicated malaria in Ghana or in West African countries. The effectiveness of the AL combination needs to be further studied in this region.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number NCT00119145.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
