Recent studies have shown that electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) may be an alternative to active exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with myopathy. The aim of our study was to investigate the EMS effects on muscle mass preservation of critically ill patients with the use of ultrasonography (US).\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-nine critically ill patients (age: 59 \u00b1 21 years) with an APACHE II admission score \u226513 were randomly assigned after stratification upon admission to receive daily EMS sessions of both lower extremities (EMS-group) or to the control group (control group). Muscle mass was evaluated with US, by measuring the cross sectional diameter (CSD) of the vastus intermedius and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps muscle.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-six patients were finally evaluated. Right rectus femoris and right vastus intermedius CSD decreased in both groups (EMS group: from 1.42 \u00b1 0.48 to 1.31 \u00b1 0.45 cm, P = 0.001 control group: from 1.59 \u00b1 0.53 to 1.37 \u00b1 0.5 cm, P = 0.002; EMS group: from 0.91 \u00b1 0.39 to 0.81 \u00b1 0.38 cm, P = 0.001 control group: from 1.40 \u00b1 0.64 to 1.11 \u00b1 0.56 cm, P = 0.004, respectively). However, the CSD of the right rectus femoris decreased significantly less in the EMS group (-0.11 \u00b1 0.06 cm, -8 \u00b1 3.9%) as compared to the control group (-0.21 \u00b1 0.10 cm, -13.9 \u00b1 6.4%; P < 0.05) and the CSD of the right vastus intermedius decreased significantly less in the EMS group (-0.10 \u00b1 0.05 cm, -12.5 \u00b1 7.4%) as compared to the control group (-0.29 \u00b1 0.28 cm, -21.5 \u00b1 15.3%; P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEMS is well tolerated and seems to preserve the muscle mass of critically ill patients.

Some studies have suggested that electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), a procedure that uses small electrical currents to make the muscles contract, could be a good substitute for exercise in patients with chronic lung or heart disease who also suffer from muscle weakness. Our study was designed to find out if EMS can help seriously ill patients keep their muscle mass, measured using ultrasound.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied 49 very sick patients, around 59 years old on average, who scored 13 or more on a scale measuring severity of illness. The patients were randomly divided into two groups when they arrived at the hospital: one that received daily EMS treatment on both legs, and a control group that did not receive the treatment. To evaluate the muscle mass, we used ultrasound to measure the thickness of two muscles in the thigh.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn the end, 26 patients were fully evaluated. Both groups lost some muscle mass, but the group treated with EMS lost significantly less muscle mass than the control group. Specifically, the two thigh muscles we measured shrank less in the EMS group than in the control group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEMS appears to be well received by patients and seems to help very sick patients maintain their muscle mass. This suggests that it could be a useful tool to prevent muscle loss and help with rehabilitation in this patient group. However, we need to do further research to fully understand its potential uses.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis clinical trial has been registered: NCT00882830.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
