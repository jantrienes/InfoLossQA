The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Brief advice was delivered during routine consultation by the practitioner after an onsite training session. Both interventions were based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change.\n\nMEASUREMENTS.\nSelf-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups.\n\nFINDINGS.\nAmong participants completing the last follow-up, 6-month prolonged abstinence was 18.3% in the tailored letters intervention group, 14.8% in the brief advice intervention group and 10.5% in the assessment-only control group. Assuming those lost to follow-up to be smokers, the rates were 10.2%, 9.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Analyses including all follow-ups confirmed statistically significant effects of both interventions compared to assessment only. Using complete case analysis, the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4; P = 0.047] but not for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.4; P = 0.068) for prolonged abstinence, or for alternative assumptions about participants lost to follow-up.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study demonstrated long-term efficacy of low-cost interventions for smoking cessation in general practice. The interventions are suitable to reach entire populations of general practices and smoking patients. Computer-generated letters are a promising option to overcome barriers to provide smoking cessation counselling routinely.\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL.\nThis study aimed to see if personalized, computer-generated letters or simple advice from a physician could help people stop smoking. We also wanted to compare these two methods to see which one is more effective.\n\nDESIGN.\nWe ran a controlled experiment where participants were placed into groups somewhat randomly.\n\nSETTING.\nWe selected 34 doctor's offices in a particular part of Germany to take part in the study (87% agreed to participate).\n\nPARTICIPANTS.\n1499 smokers between the ages of 18 and 70 from these doctor's offices took part in the study (80% agreed to participate).\n\nMETHODS.\nOne group of participants received up to three personalized letters with advice on how to quit smoking. Another group received quick advice from their doctor during a regular visit. Both methods were based on a well-known theory about how people change their behaviours.\n\nMEASUREMENTS.\nWe asked participants whether they had quit smoking at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after the start of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nAmong the participants who completed the study, 18.3% of those who received the letters and 14.8% of those who received advice from their doctor had quit smoking for at least 6 months. This is compared to 10.5% in the group that didn't receive any intervention. Even when including participants who didn't finish the study (assuming they hadn't quit smoking), we found both interventions to be more effective than doing nothing. The letters also proved to be more effective than the doctor's advice for those who managed to quit smoking for at least 24 hours.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study showed that both of these low-cost methods can help people quit smoking in the long term. They can easily be used across all doctor's offices and for all smoking patients. The computer-generated letters, in particular, are a promising way to regularly provide advice on quitting smoking without needing to overcome the usual obstacles.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
