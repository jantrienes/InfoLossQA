The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.\n\nRESULTS.\nRiociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: \u2212285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \u2212357 to \u2212213); p<0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; \u2212131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \u2212214 to \u221248); p=0.0025) patients. Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p<0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17). Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(\u22124.7 mm Hg (95% CI \u22126.9 to \u22122.6; p<0.0001 and \u22124.8 mm Hg (\u20138.2 to \u22121.5; p=0.0055), respectively). For all patients, changes in 6 min walk distance correlated with changes in PVR (r=\u22120.29 (95% CI \u22120.41 to \u22120.17); p<0.0001) and cardiac index (r=0.23 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.35); p=0.0004).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nRiociguat improved haemodynamics in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent CTEPH.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.\nNCT00855465.\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL.\nThe aim of this study was to see if the drug riociguat helped patients with a certain type of non-operable chronic lung disease.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested 261 patients (average age 59, 66% women) who had this chronic lung disease and could not have surgery or still had the disease after surgery. We gave some patients the drug riociguat and others a placebo. We tested certain indicators of heart and lung function at the start of the experiment and 16 weeks later. \n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that riociguat reduced resistance to blood flow in the lungs in both groups of patients, improving their heart's ability to pump blood. The drug also reduced blood pressure in the lungs. Furthermore, patients who showed improvement in the indicators we were testing also walked longer in a 6-minute walking test, suggesting they had better overall health. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings suggest that riociguat can improve heart and lung function in patients with this non-operable chronic lung disease.

Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other.
