The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Patients were randomized into three groups. Patients were premedicated intravenously with normal saline in group 1, 50 \u00b5g fentanyl in group 2, and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine in group 3. All patients received intravenous propofol for sedation. Propofol consumption in mg/kg/h was noted. The incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, desaturation, and coughing was noted. The time to achieve a Post Anesthesia Discharge Score (PADS) of 10 was also noted.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were 68 patients in group 1, 70 in group 2, and 72 in group 3. The amount of propofol consumed was significantly higher in group 1 (9.25 [7.3\u201313.2]) than in group 2 (8.8 [6.8\u201312.2]) and group 3 (7.6 [5.7\u20139.8]). Patient hemodynamics and oxygenation were well maintained and comparable in all groups. The time to achieve a PADS of 10 was significantly higher in group 3 compared to the other two groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of 50 \u00b5g fentanyl or 0.5 mg/kg ketamine in a single dose during EUS reduces the dose of propofol required for sedation. However, unlike the addition of fentanyl, the addition of ketamine increased the time to recovery. Thus, 50 \u00b5g fentanyl is a good additive to propofol infusion for sedation during EUS to reduce the requirement for propofol without affecting the time to recovery.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nWe wanted to see if using a small dose of either ketamine or fentanyl could lower the amount of propofol needed when putting people to sleep for a certain type of ultrasound scan. We also wanted to make sure this wouldn't affect the safety of the patients or how long it took them to wake up from the anaesthesia.\n\nMETHODS: \nWe ran a test with 210 adults who were going to have this ultrasound scan where you have to be sedated. We divided them into three groups. Group 1 received only a harmless saltwater solution as a control, Group 2 received a small dose of fentanyl, and Group 3 got a small amount of ketamine. Everybody also got the usual sedative, propofol. We measured how much of this sedative each group required. We also noted if they had any reactions like low blood pressure, slow heart rate, trouble breathing, or coughing, and how long it took for them to be lucid enough to be sent home.\n\nRESULTS:\nGroup 1 had 68 patients, Group 2 had 70, and Group 3 had 72. The first group needed more of the propofol than the other two groups. Regardless of which treatment they received, everyone's blood flow and oxygen levels were fine. However, the patients who'd received the ketamine took longer to be awake and alert enough to leave.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nUsing a little bit of either fentanyl or ketamine when this type of ultrasound is happening can lower the amount of the usual sedative needed. But, if we use ketamine, it took the patients longer to wake up enough to go home. We found that a small dose of fentanyl could be a good add-on to the propofol sedative during this procedure. This can lower the amount propofol we need to use, but it doesn't make it take any longer for patients to be ready to go home.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
