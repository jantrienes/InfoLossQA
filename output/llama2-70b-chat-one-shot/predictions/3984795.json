The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

After initial screening the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group had significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL (P < 0.05) value. VSL#3 improved insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01), decreased hsCRP, and favorably affected the composition of gut microbiota. Omega-3 had significant effect on insulin sensitivity and hsCRP but had no effect on gut microbiota. Addition of omega-3 fatty acid with VSL#3 had more pronounced effect on HDL, insulin sensitivity and hsCRP. Subjects with low HDL, insulin resistance, and high hsCRP had significantly lower total lactobacilli and bifidobacteria count and higher E. coli and bacteroides count.\n\n### Simplification\nWe ran a study with 60 adults who were a bit overweight but otherwise healthy, all between 40 and 60 years old. The aim was to see the effects of probiotics (specifically, VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acids on our body\u2019s response to insulin, cholesterol levels in the blood, and inflammation. \n\nParticipants were randomly sorted into four groups. The first group was given a placebo; the second group took omega-3 fatty acids; the third group took the probiotic VSL#3; the fourth group had both omega-3 and the probiotic, for a period of 6 weeks. We collected blood and stool samples at the start and end of the study.\n\nThe group that took the probiotic VSL#3 showed a significant reduction in bad cholesterol and triglycerides, along with an increase in good cholesterol. This probiotic also improved the body's response to insulin (which reduces risk of diabetes), reduced inflammation, and positively changed gut bacteria composition. \n\nOmega-3 alone improved the body's response to insulin and reduced inflammation, but didn't appear to affect gut bacteria. However, when omega-3 was used with VSL#3, the effects on good cholesterol, body's response to insulin, and inflammation were more pronounced.\n\nWe noticed that people with low amounts of good cholesterol, insulin resistance, and high inflammation had worse gut bacteria composition. They had significantly less 'good' bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and more of some specific 'bad' bacteria (E. coli and Bacteroides).\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. Annotate the sample above. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.
