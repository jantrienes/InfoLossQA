The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of regular Taekwondo (TKD) training on physical fitness, mood, sociability, and cognitive functions in these children. Methods: This study included 30 children from multicultural families in Korea who were randomly assigned to a TKD group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). The children in TKD group underwent 16 weeks of TKD training once a week for 60 min. Each participant underwent a basic fitness test and sociability questionnaire before and after the intervention. Furthermore, we examined the changes in the mood and cognitive function by determining the profile of mood states (POMS), and Stroop color and word test, respectively. Results: Results of the Stork test of balance were significantly higher in the TKD group after intervention (p < 0.05). In terms of sub-variables, POMS, tension, and depression scores were significantly lower (p < 0.05) after the intervention, while the vigor score was significantly higher in the intervention group than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, sociability and 'being left out' score, a sub-variable of sociability, was significantly lower (p < 0.05) after the intervention, while sociability score was significantly higher (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that participation in regular TKD training can be effective for balanced improvements in variables of basic fitness and that it exerts a positive effect on the mood and development of sociability.\n\n### Simplification\nPurpose: In South Korea, children from families with diverse cultural backgrounds often face challenges regarding their physical, social, mental, and intellectual development. Not enough action is taken to see if activities like Taekwondo can improve these areas. We wanted to find out if regular Taekwondo classes can improve fitness, mood, social skills, and thinking abilities in these children. \n\nMethods: For our study, we had 30 children from multicultural families. We divided them into two groups: 15 children attended Taekwondo sessions once a week for 16 weeks, and the other 15 children didn't. We measured their fitness levels and how well they socialize by using questionnaires before and after the Taekwondo classes. We also evaluated changes in their mood and ability to think by examining their state of mind and their performance in a color and word test. \n\nResults: The balance of the children who participated in Taekwondo improved significantly. They experienced less tension and depression, as well as increased energy levels compared to the other group. Their social skills also improved, and they felt less left out after the Taekwondo program. \n\nConclusions: The results suggest that regular Taekwondo training can improve basic fitness levels, mood, and social abilities in children from families with multiple cultural backgrounds.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
