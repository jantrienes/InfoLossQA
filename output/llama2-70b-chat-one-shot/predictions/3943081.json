The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of chest physiotherapy in prevention of postextubation atelectasis in pediatric patients.\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS.\nIn a case-control study from March 2007 to March 2011, two groups of patients (35 patients in each group) susceptible to lung collapse were enrolled in the study. The studied patients had neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy, and cerebral palsy. The patients were randomly divided into two groups (case and control); The case group underwent daily chest physiotherapy through vibrator and chest percussion and the control group was under supervision. In the latter group, the underlying disease was treated and the lung collapse was managed, if occurred.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe frequency of atelectasis was lower in the case group who received prophylactic chest physiotherapy compared to the control group (16.6% vs. 40%).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nChest physiotherapy as well as appropriate and regular change of position can considerably reduce the rate of pulmonary collapse in pediatric patients.\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL.\nCertain studies have disagreed on whether chest physiotherapy (a treatment involving physical movement and manipulation to breathe better) can help prevent instances of lung collapse in children after they have been on a breathing machine. Our goal was to look into how effective chest physiotherapy is in stopping a collapsed lung in children patients. \n\nWHAT WE DID.\nBetween March 2007 and March 2011, we ran a study comparing two groups of patients (35 kids in each group) who were at risk of lung collapse. These kids had muscle and nerve illnesses like spinal muscular atrophy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy, and cerebral palsy. We randomly put the patients into two groups (test and comparison); The test group received daily chest physiotherapy using a vibrating machine and manual chest hitting, and the comparison group was simply monitored. For the latter group, we treated their disease and managed any lung collapse if it happened.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nOccurrence of lung collapse was lower in the group that received chest physiotherapy (16.6% vs. 40%).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nChest physiotherapy and regular position changes can greatly lower the chance of lung collapse in child patients.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.

Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text.

It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.
