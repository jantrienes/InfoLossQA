The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Dexmedetomidine can cause a biphasic cardiovascular response, and induce transient hypertension. Hypotension is a common complication of spinal anesthesia. Decreasing anxiety of patients before procedure is important for high quality of procedure. This study aimed to compare the incidence of hypotension and patients' anxiety and comfort levels when dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered before and after spinal anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nSeventy-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II were randomly allocated into two groups. Spinal anesthesia was performed using 12 mg of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine. In Group A, 1 \u03bcg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered for 10 min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/hr after 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Patients in Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Perioperative vital signs, anxiety (using the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and comfort (using the numerical rating scale) were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in Group A (16.1%) than in Group B (48.4%) during infusion of dexmedetomidine (p = 0.01). The need for treatment of hypotension is higher in Group B than Group A (p = 0.02). The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation did not significantly differ between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences regarding the patients' anxiety and comfort.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nHypotension is more frequently occurred, and the treatment of hypotension is more needed in Group B. The intravenously administration of dexmedetomidine before spinal anesthesia has no advantages in hemodynamic status and patients' comfort compared to that after spinal anesthesia during lower limb surgery.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02155010. Retrospectively registered on May 22, 2014.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nDexmedetomidine is a drug that helps to reduce pain, anxiety, and causes sleepiness without affecting breathing. However, it can cause changes in blood pressure. Sometimes, after spinal anesthesia, patients can experience low blood pressure. We wanted to understand if giving dexmedetomidine before or after the anesthesia could affect blood pressure changes and patient comfort level.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested this idea on 74 patients, who were all generally healthy or had only mild systemic illness. They were divided into two groups. Both received spinal anesthesia and dexmedetomidine, but the order in which they received the drug was different.\nGroup A received the drug after the anesthesia, while Group B received it before. We monitored their vital signs during and after surgery and also used questionnaires to understand their level of anxiety and comfort.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was a difference in blood pressure changes between the two groups. Fewer patients in Group A experienced low blood pressure compared to Group B. Also, more patients in Group B required treatment for low blood pressure. However, heart rate and oxygen levels were similar in both groups and there were no significant differences in the patients' anxiety and comfort levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study found that more patients experienced low blood pressure and required treatment when given Dexmedetomidine before rather than after spinal anesthesia. However, giving the drug before or after anesthesia didn't make a significant difference in patients' comfort or anxiety levels during lower limb surgeries.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial is recorded in the U.S National Library of Medicine under the identification number NCT02155010 and was first registered on the database on May 22, 2014.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
