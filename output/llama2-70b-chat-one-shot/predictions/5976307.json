The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

We investigated whether etomidate\u2013midazolam is associated with fewer cardiopulmonary adverse events and has noninferior efficacy compared to propofol\u2013midazolam for screening colonoscopy in the elderly.\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was performed. Patients aged over 65 years who were scheduled to undergo screening colonoscopy were randomized to receive either etomidate or propofol based on midazolam. The primary outcome was all cardiopulmonary adverse events. The secondary outcomes were vital sign fluctuation (VSF), adverse events disturbing the procedure, and sedation-related outcomes.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) (P\u200a=\u200a.040). VSF was detected in 17 (27.4%) and 31 (50.0%) patients in the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively (P\u200a=\u200a.010). The incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol group (8.1%) (P\u200a=\u200a.008). Moreover, the incidence rate of myoclonus was significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol group (1.6%) (P\u200a=\u200a.004). There was no statistical significance between the 2 groups with respect to sedation times and sedation-related outcomes including patients\u2019 and endoscopist's satisfaction. In the multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179\u20130.926, P\u200a=\u200a.032).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nWe recommend using etomidate\u2013midazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol\u2013midazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score.\n\n### Simplification\nABSTRACT.\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS::\nRecent research shows that using etomidate for sedation during a colonoscopy could be safer than propofol for older people. Both are comparable in their effectiveness. We studied whether using etomidate with another sedative, midazolam, might lead to fewer heart and lung-related side effects compared to using propofol and midazolam. \n\nMETHODS.\nWe carried out a clinical trial at a single center. We focused on patients over 65 years old who were due for a routine colonoscopy. These patients were randomly chosen to receive either etomidate or propofol along with midazolam. We mainly wanted to see which group had less heart and lung issues. We also looked at the patient's vital signs, any issues that interfered with the procedure, and the results related to the use of sedatives.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe number of heart and lung-related issues was higher in the patients who received propofol (72.6%) as compared to those who received etomidate (54.8%). Changes in vital signs were observed in 27.4% of patients receiving etomidate and 50.0% of patients receiving propofol. Procedure-related complications were also significantly higher among patients in the etomidate group (25.8%) compared to the propofol group (8.1%). There were also more cases of muscle twitching observed in the etomidate group (16.1%) compared to the propofol group (1.6%). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of sedation times and how satisfied the patients and doctors were with the sedation process. When it came to changes in vital signs, patients receiving etomidate were much less likely to experience these than those receiving propofol.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFor patients who are at a high risk of complications or have severe medical conditions, we recommend using etomidate with midazolam. On the other hand, for patients at lower risk, propofol with midazolam could be a better choice.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
