The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

The order of the fourth explorations was randomly assigned. During these explorations, we measured blood glucose every 15 min for 4 h and compared the mean and glycemic fluctuations for each test. A resting ECG was performed before and after quinine infusion in each participant.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe mean glycemic level during the 4-h infusion was 83 \u00b1 5 mg/dl without quinine versus 74 \u00b1 5 \u200b\u200bmg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) using saline solute versus 92 \u00b1 7 mg/dl without quinine versus 82 \u00b1 5 mg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) when associated with the glucose solute. In isotonic dirty solute, quinine induces a cumulative glycemic decrease of 17.5% (p = 0.01) characterized by a nadir estimated at \u221226.5% at the 60th minute (65 \u00b1 23 mg/dl), p <0.001 followed by a gradual increase until the 4th hour. There were no signs of hypoglycemia or significant prolongation of the QT interval at the ECG. Overall, quinine did not induce a significant change in blood glucose with glucose compared to saline.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe intravenous infusion of quinine at a therapeutic dose induces a light drop in blood glucose with a significant nadir at the 60th minute in the healthy subject without hypoglycemia. This suggests the need for close monitoring in patients at risk of hypoglycemia such as those with severe malaria especially during the first hour of quinine infusion.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was conducted to see how quinine, a medication used for malaria, affects blood sugar levels in healthy people.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested blood sugar responses to a 4-hour dose of saline (salt) solution or a glucose (sugar) solution, with and without quinine. We used ten healthy volunteers, mainly men, averaging 28 years old. The experiments were conducted in a random order. In each experiment, we checked the blood sugar every 15 minutes for 4 hours and compared the average and changes in blood sugar for each test. We also performed a resting ECG (a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat) before and after giving quinine to each participant.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe average blood sugar level during the 4-hour test was slightly lower with quinine than without it, both in the salt and sugar solutions. The largest drop (17.5%) occurred at the 60th minute but then it gradually increased until the 4th hour. There were no indications of too low blood sugar or significant heart rhythm changes as shown by the ECG. Overall, quinine didn't cause a significant change in blood sugar levels compared to the saline solution.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nGiving quinine through IV at a normal dose resulted in a small drop in blood sugar levels, which hit its lowest point at the 60th minute in healthy people. There were no signs of dangerously low blood sugar. This implies that patients at risk of low blood sugar levels, such as those with severe malaria, should be watched closely during the first hour of quinine treatment.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
