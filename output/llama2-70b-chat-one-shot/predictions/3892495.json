The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Subjects (n=8) were randomly provided with either 1 g/kg body weight of glucose in 200 mL water (CHO) or 200 mL water alone (CON) 30 min prior to exercise and subsequently walked on a treadmill at 50% of VO2max for 60 min. Plasma hGH concentrations were significantly higher in subjects who received CHO compared to those who received CON at 15 and 30 min. The fat oxidation rate in the CHO was significantly lower than the CON while walking for 5~15, 25~35 and 45~55 min. Plasma FFA levels were also significantly lower in the CHO compared to the CON at 30, 45 and 60 min. Plasma glucose levels in the CHO were significantly lower while plasma insulin levels were significantly higher than in the CON at 15 and 30 min. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the elevation of plasma hGH levels due to the intake of a pre-exercise meal may not be strongly related to fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels during low-intensity exercise.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study was about seeing how having a meal before exercising affected growth hormone levels in the blood and the burning of fat during walking exercise. The people in the study (8 of them) were given either a glucose drink or just water half an hour before they started walking on a treadmill at half of their maximum exercise output for an hour. \n\nThe people who had the glucose drink had significantly more growth hormone in their blood, compared to those who only had water, after 15 and 30 minutes. However, the rate at which they were burning fat was significantly lower at certain time intervals (5-15 minutes, 25-35 minutes, and 45-55 minutes into their walk). Their level of free fatty acids in the blood was also lower after 30, 45, and 60 minutes of walking. The glucose drinkers had lower blood sugar levels but higher insulin levels after 15 and 30 minutes. \n\nIn conclusion, this study suggests that having a meal before exercising might raise growth hormone levels in the blood, but it doesn't seem to be strongly tied to fat burning and free fatty acid levels in the blood during mild exercise like walking.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
