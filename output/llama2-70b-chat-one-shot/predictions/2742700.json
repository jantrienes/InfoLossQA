The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

While several care models have shown effectiveness in achieving various outcomes among these patients, it remains unclear what care model is most effective in improving blood pressure control in primary care. In this prospective study, 54 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and blood pressure of >140/90 identified through the registry, were randomized into three groups. Group A attended a nurse educator-conducted class on diabetes and hypertension, group B attended the same class and was asked to monitor their home blood pressure using provided device, and group C served as control (usual care). Of the 24 subjects who completed the study, only 20% achieved the target blood pressure of <130/80 and there was no statistical difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures among the three groups (p > 0.05). Efforts to intensify management of hypertension among type 2 diabetes patients did not result in better blood pressure control compared to usual care. Studies looking into factors which limit patients' participation in group classes and determining patients' preferences in disease management would be helpful in ensuring success of any chronic disease management program.\n\n### Simplification\nThere's a need for better ways to treat diabetes patients who also have high blood pressure at their primary doctor's office. There are a number of ways these patients are managed, but we don't know what the best approach is to control blood pressure for these people. \n\nIn this study, we asked 54 people with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure to join three different groups. Group A went to a class run by a nurse about diabetes and high blood pressure. Group B went to the same class and was given a device to track their blood pressure at home. Group C, the control group, got the usual care they'd get from their doctors. \n\nOf the 24 people finished the study, only 20% reached the goal blood pressure we set. We didn't see any meaningful difference in average blood pressure from any of the groups. So trying to improve high blood pressure management for these patients didn't result in better blood pressure levels than the usual care. \n\nResearch into why patients might not want to go to group classes and what they prefer when managing their disease could help make these treatment programs more successful in the future.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
