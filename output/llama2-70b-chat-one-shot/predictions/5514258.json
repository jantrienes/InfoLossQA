The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

This study uses the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to describe the epidemiology of salivary gland cancer patients and to investigate whether treatment with adjuvant radiation improves overall survival.\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS.\nA total of 8243 patients diagnosed with a major salivary gland cancer were identified from the NCDB. All patients received primary surgical resection of their malignancy. Patients were risk-stratified by adverse features, and overall survival rates were determined. Patients were considered high risk if they had extracapsular extension and/or positive margin after resection. Patients were considered intermediate risk if they did not meet the criteria for high risk but had pT3-T4 disease, pN+ disease, lymphovascular space invasion, adenoid cystic histology, or grade 2-3 disease. Patients who did not meet criteria for high or intermediate risk were considered low risk. Overall patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment factors, and outcomes were summarized with descriptive statistics and analyzed with STATA.\n\nRESULTS.\nMedian follow-up in this cohort was 42.4 months, with the median age of 58 years. Patients in the high-risk group had greater survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; P = .002; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.91) if they received adjuvant radiation therapy. In contrast, patients in the intermediate- (HR, 1.01; P = .904; 95% CI, 0.85-1.20) and low-risk groups (HR, 0.85; P = .427; 95% CI, 0.57-1.26) did not experience a survival benefit with adjuvant radiation therapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis large analysis compared survival outcomes between observation and adjuvant radiation alone in risk-stratified patients after resection of major salivary glands using a national database. The use of adjuvant radiation for high-risk major salivary gland cancers appears to offer a survival benefit. Although an overall survival benefit was not seen in low- and intermediate-risk salivary gland cancers, this study could not address impact on local control because of the limitations of the NCDB.\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL.\nThis study looked at the overall outcomes of people who have cancer in their salivary glands (the part of the mouth that produces saliva) after surgery. The researchers wanted to see if getting additional radiation therapy after surgery would affect how long these patients lived. \n\nMETHODS.\nThey gathered information about 8243 patients who had surgery for this type of cancer. Each patient was categorized into a risk level (high, medium, or low) based on certain features of their disease (how far it had spread, cancer type, and so on). Then, the researchers tracked how long each patient lived after the operation. They used certain statistical methods to analyze the data.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe average time the researchers were able to follow up with patients was just over 42 months, and the average age was 58. The study found that patients at high risk of the disease spreading lived longer if they got radiation therapy after surgery. But, this was not the case for people at medium and low risk. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study suggests that for patients at high risk, additional radiation therapy after surgery for salivary gland cancer might help them live longer. However, it did not seem to change the survival rates for patients with medium or low risk. However, the study did not look at whether this additional treatment helped control the disease locally, which is one of the areas the researchers were unsure about, due to limitations in the original information they gathered about patients.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
