The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Nevertheless, breastfeeding rates remain low despite public health efforts. Our study aims to investigate the effect of controlled limited formula usage during birth hospitalisation on breastfeeding, using the primary hypothesis that early limited formula feeds in infants with early weight loss will not adversely affect the rate of exclusive or any breastfeeding as measured at discharge, 3 and 6 months of age.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nWe randomly assigned 104 healthy term infants, 24 to 48 hours old, with \u2265 5% loss of birth weight to controlled limited formula (CLF) intervention (10 ml formula by syringe after each breastfeeding, discontinued at onset of lactation) or control group (standard approach, SA). Groups were compared for demographic data and breastfeeding rates at discharge, 3 months and 6 months of age (p-values adjusted for multiple testing).\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty newborns were analysed in CLF and 50 in SA group. There were no differences in demographic data or clinical characteristics between groups. We found no evidence of difference between treatment groups in the rates of exclusive as well as any breastfeeding at discharge (p-value 0.2 and >0.99 respectively), 3 months (p-value 0.12 and 0.10) and 6 months of infants\u2019 age (p-value 0.45 and 0.34 respectively). The percentage weight loss during hospitalisation was significantly higher in the SA group (7.3% in CLF group, 8.4% in SA group, p = 0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study shows that controlled limited formula use does not have an adverse effect on rates of breastfeeding in the short and long term. Larger studies are needed to confirm a possible potential in controlled limited formula use to support establishing breastfeeding and to help to improve the rates of breastfeeding overall.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nISRCTN registry ISRCTN61915183\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL OF THE STUDY.\nBreastfeeding is good for a baby's health and overall wellbeing-- but not enough women do it. We wanted to see if giving newborns a small amount of baby formula right after birth would hurt or help breastfeeding rates. We also wanted to know whether this approach would hinder breastfeeding when the baby is three or six months old.\n\nHOW THE STUDY WAS DONE.\nWe picked 104 healthy babies that had lost more than 5% of their birth weight and were between one and two days old. We split them into two groups. In one group, we gave the babies 10 ml of baby formula feed after each breastfeeding session (this was stopped as soon as the mother's milk came in). The other group followed the standard approach. We tracked breastfeeding rates when the babies left the hospital, and then checked in when they were three and six months old.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nIn both groups, 50 newborns were examined. The groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical characteristics. There was no noticeable difference in breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge, at three months, or at six months between the two groups. One thing that did differ, was the amount of weight the babies lost in the hospital - babies in the standard approach lost more weight.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS.\nOur study shows that giving newborns a small amount of baby formula feed doesn't seem to hurt breastfeeding rates in the short or long term. More studies need to be done to see if this approach can help more moms breastfeed and keep breastfeeding for longer.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS.\nThe study is registered with the ISRCTN under the number ISRCTN61915183.\n\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
