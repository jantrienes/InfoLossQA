The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of religious programs based on Islam on spiritual wellbeing in elderly patients with hypertension who referred to the health centers of Isfahan in 2014.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThis study was a randomized clinical trial. The participants (52 elderly patients with hypertension) were randomly divided in to experimental and control groups. Religious program was implemented for the experimental group in eight sessions in two Isfahan health centers. Spirituality wellbeing survey (SWB) questionnaire was completed in three steps, namely, pretest, posttest and follow-up (1 month) in two groups. In the study, Chi-square test, independent t-test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance were performed for analyzing the data.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the intervention, there was no significant difference between the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing of the two groups. However in the posttest step and follow-up stage, the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe religious program based on Islam promoted the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension; further, nurses can use these programs to promote the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nMany older people with high blood pressure suffer from poor spiritual health which can negatively affect them mentally, socially, and physically. Given this, it's important to explore ways of boosting their spiritual wellness. In this study, we examined the effects of religious programs based on Islam on improving spiritual health among elderly people with high blood pressure attending health clinics in Isfahan in 2014.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe carried out our experiment by selecting 52 older people with high blood pressure and splitting them randomly into two groups. One group attended an Islamic-based religious program for eight sessions in two health centers in Isfahan. A questionnaire designed to measure spiritual wellbeing was completed by both groups during three stages; before the program (pre-test), at the end of the program (post-test), and a month after the program (follow-up). We used statistical tests to analyze the data we collected.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the religious program, there was no significant difference between the spiritual wellbeing scores of the two groups. However, after the program and a month later, the group that attended the program had significantly higher spiritual wellbeing scores than the group that did not attend the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings suggest that an Islamic-based religious program can enhance the spiritual wellbeing of elderly people with high blood pressure. Therefore, health professionals like nurses can use such programs to improve their patients' spiritual health.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. Annotate the sample above. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.
