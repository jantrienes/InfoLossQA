The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D.

Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct (mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group CBT treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group CBT in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group CBT for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching CBT skills.\n\nRESULTS.\nIntent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=\u22122.21, P=.03). Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=\u22121.65, P=.10). Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=\u2212.29, 95% CI \u22120.38 to \u22120.19, z=\u22125.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions (B=\u2212.20, 95% CI \u22120.32 to \u22120.07, z=\u22123.12, P=.002) experienced significant decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom reduction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool to sustain engagement in CBT for depression over time. There were no differences in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is known to help with depression. But it faces some obstacles when used in low-income communities like people's lack of commitment to regular therapy sessions and homework. However, using automated text messages may help solve these issues, as they can remind patients about their treatment and encourage them to stick with it.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe study tests if a texting service improves people's commitment and results in group therapy sessions for depression. The texts include prompts for mood monitoring and reminders about therapy content. The focus is specifically on whether this service boosts the number of therapy sessions attended, how long patients stay in therapy, and whether it successfully lessens depression symptoms in Spanish-speaking Latino patients with low income.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients were divided into two groups. One received the typical CBT treatment for depression alone (40 participants), while the second group received the same treatment plus the texting service (45 participants). The texting service included daily mood checks, daily reminders about therapy topics, and reminders about medication and therapy sessions. The therapist could access these texts and use them as part of the therapy process.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe study found that those who received texts as part of their treatment stayed in therapy for significantly longer. On average, they remained for 13.5 weeks, compared to just 3 weeks for the standard treatment group. Generally, the texting group also attended more therapy sessions, although this wasn't a significant difference. Both groups showed a substantial reduction in depression symptoms over the course of the treatment. Still, there wasn't a noticeable difference in symptom reduction between the two groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAutomated text messages can be a useful tool to keep patients engaged in their depression treatment. Even though both groups showed a decrease in symptoms, the texting service helped patients to stick with their therapy for longer. The fact that depression levels didn't differ much between the groups might have been influenced by a low number of responses from participants who quit therapy early.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
