The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nMETHODS.\nWomen with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nRESULTS.\nOPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nSometimes, doctors need to induce labor in pregnant women, which means they have to artificially start the labor process. This is a common procedure that affects both the woman and the health care system. One way to reduce the impact, is to carry out the procedure in an outpatient setting, meaning the patient can go home after the procedure instead of staying at the hospital. There's not much information on how outpatient and inpatient inductions compare, and also some safety worries if outpatient inductions use a certain medication used in inpatient settings. This study is aiming to see if it's feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients to induce labor in an outpatient setting using a Foley catheter, compared to inpatient inductions using vaginal PGE2.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn the study, 101 women who needed labor induced were split into two groups. 50 women were in the outpatient group and used a Foley catheter for induction. These women were able to go home overnight after a reassuring test. The other 51 women were in the inpatient group and used vaginal PGE2 for induction. The main things checked were how long the hospital stay was, how the baby was born, how long it took from induction to delivery, any side effects, and how satisfied the patients were.\n\nRESULTS.\nWomen in the outpatient group spent less time in the hospital before giving birth, but those in the inpatient group were more likely to have a vaginal birth within 12 hours of going to the Birthing Unit. Overall vaginal birth rates, the time from induction to delivery, and total time spent in the hospital were almost the same for both groups. However, the outpatient group felt less pain and had better sleep but were more likely need additional labor induction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient labor induction was feasible and acceptable for women who are not in a good condition to give birth naturally, however, it did not show a significant reduction in total time spent in the hospital and was associated with increased need for labor induction.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis study has been reported to the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
