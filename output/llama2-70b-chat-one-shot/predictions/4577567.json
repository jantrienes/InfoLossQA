The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

However, the stride parameters emerging from such an analysis have never been used to design a training protocol aimed at increasing stride length. With this aim, we investigated the effects of stride frequency manipulation during three weeks of uphill (2%) training on stride length at iso-efficiency speed. Twelve male race walkers were randomly allocated to one of two training groups: stride frequency manipulation (RWM, n=6) and free stride frequency (RWF, n=6). Results. Kinematic parameters measured before and after the 3-week training in RWM showed increased stride length (4.54%; p<0.0001) and contact time (4.58%; p<0.001); inversely, a decreased stride frequency (4.44%; p<0.0001) and internal work (7.09%; p<0.05) were found. In RWF the effect of the training showed a decrease in stride length (1.18%; p<0.0001) and contact time (<1%; p<0.0001) with respect to baseline conditions and an increased stride frequency and internal work of 1.19% (p<0.0001). These results suggest that using slopes (2%) as RWM could help coaches to provide some training methods that would improve an athlete's performance, through increasing stride length without altering his or her race walking technique or metabolic demands.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looked at whether manipulating the speed of steps (stride frequency) during uphill training could increase the distance covered in a single step (stride length) in race walking. The researchers took twelve male race walkers and split them randomly into two groups. One group had structured step frequency during their training, and the other had no specific step frequency set.\n\nThe results showed that the group with structured step frequency saw an increase in the distance of their step and the time their foot was in contact with the ground. Simultaneously, the speed of their steps and energy used decreased. The group without specific step frequency had a decrease in the distance of their step and foot contact time but saw an increase in the speed of their steps and energy used.\n\nThis research suggests that training on slopes with specific step frequencies could offer coaches a useful technique to improve race walkers\u2019 performance by increasing the distance of their steps without changing the walker's style or creating extra energy demand.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
