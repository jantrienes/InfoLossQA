The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Twenty people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I through III) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a balance-based exergaming group (N = 10) or a balance training group (N = 10) for an 8-week balance training period. Postural stability was assessed using the limits of stability (LOS) and one-leg stance (OLS) tests. Balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the timed up and go (TUG) test. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter training, participants in the balance-based exergaming group showed significant improvements in LOS performance, and in the eyes-closed condition of the OLS test. Both training programs led to improvements in BBS and TUG performance. Furthermore, balance-based exergaming training resulted in significantly better performance in directional control in the LOS test (78.9 \u00b1 7.65 %) compared with conventional balance training (70.6 \u00b1 9.37 %).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBalance-based exergaming training resulted in a greater improvement in postural stability compared with conventional balance training.

We had twenty people with Parkinson's disease take part. These people were either at the early, middle or later stages of the disease. Half of them were put into a group that did the Kinect exergame for balance, and the other half were put into a group that did traditional balance training. This went on for 8 weeks. We used certain tests (LOS, OLS, BBS and TUG) to measure their balance and stability before and after the training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the training, we found that the group that did the Kinect exergame had better results in some stability tests. Both groups improved in the BBS and TUG balance tests. In one of the LOS tests, the exergaming group did much better than the traditional training group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe group that did the Kinect exergame improved more in their stability than the group that did traditional training. Our study suggests that these kind of exercise games can be helpful for people with Parkinson's disease.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe details of the trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov.NCT02671396\n\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL.\nThere's more information online in the supplement of the article.
