The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The present study was undertaken with the aim to compare the efficacy of high and low oral doses of haloperidol in the treatment of acute and transient psychotic disorders. The sample comprised of forty patients of both sexes diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic disorder who were randomly assigned to high dose (20 mg/day) and low dose (5 mg /day) haloperidol groups with equal number of subjects (n=20) in both groups. Weekly assessment was done on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Haloperidol Side-effects Check List (day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 & 42). Both groups showed significant improvement in BPRS from baseline scores on all assessments. Comparison of the improvement rate in both study groups revealed no significant difference.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study is about testing whether high or low doses of a drug called haloperidol are more effective at treating short-lasting mental illnesses. The researchers started out thinking that high doses might work better and faster, but some recent studies have disagreed with this idea. They decided to test it out themselves.\n\n40 patients - both male and female - who were experiencing a brief bout of mental illness were chosen for this study. These patients were randomly split into two groups, with one group receiving a high dose (20 mg/day) and the other receiving a low dose (5 mg/day) of haloperidol. Over a six-week period, the groups were checked weekly for any improvement in their symptoms and side effects from the drug.\n\nIn the end, both groups showed significant recovery from their initial symptoms at every check-up. When they compared the two groups, the researchers found no notable difference in how much the patients improved. So, it didn't really matter whether they were given a high or low dose - they ended up getting better around the same amount.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.

It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.
