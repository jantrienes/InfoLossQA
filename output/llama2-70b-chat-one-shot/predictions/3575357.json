The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Participants either received (n = 50) the PAPP for 60 minutes, twice a week during three months or (n = 50) they received health education. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured by general state of health the Short Form 12 health survey questionnaire, and the quality of life was determined with the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire. Cardiopulmonary function was measured with a spirometry and a walking test according to the Bruce protocol.\n\nRESULTS.\nThis pilot study had a significant impact on the quality of life (p = 0.05) in men, which increased. However, the quality of life in women did not improve. The average changes in the lung and cardiovascular function was not significant between groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nChanges in the quality of life measured with EQ-5D in the group of men who carried out the PAPP were statistically significant when comparing between groups. However changes in cardiopulmonary function were not as relevant when comparing between groups.

Half of them did the PAPP for an hour twice a week for three months, the rest were given health education. We used questionnaires and health tests to measure how well their hearts and lungs were working, and how much their quality of life improved.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall, the program improved the quality of life in men, but not women. There wasn't a notable change in the heart and lung function for either group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe PAPP program was found to help improve quality of life for men but didn't show significant improvements in heart and lung function for anyone.

Annotate the sample above. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.
