The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Patients who maintained clinical stability for \u2a7e12 weeks were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or lurasidone (40\u201380 mg/d, flexibly dosed) for an additional 28-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to relapse (based on Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis).\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 676 patients enrolled in the open-label phase; 285 met protocol-specified stabilization criteria and were randomized to lurasidone (N=144) or placebo (N=141). During the open-label phase, mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score decreased from 90.1 to 54.4 in patients who met clinical stability criteria and were randomized. In the double-blind phase, lurasidone significantly delayed time to relapse compared with placebo (log-rank test, p=0.039), reflecting a 33.7% reduction in risk of relapse (Cox hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.663 (0.447\u20130.983); p=0.041). Probability of relapse at the double-blind week 28 endpoint (based on Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis) was 42.2% in the lurasidone group and 51.2% in the placebo group. Minimal changes in weight, lipid, glucose, and prolactin were observed throughout the study.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study demonstrated the efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia.\n\n### Simplification\nGOAL:\nWe wanted to see how well lurasidone works as a long-term treatment for schizophrenia.\n\nMETHOD:\nWe first gave adults with a severe episode of schizophrenia a 12-24 week treatment with lurasidone. After 12 weeks, those who showed improvement were then divided into two groups. One group continued using lurasidone and the other group was given a placebo (a substance with no medical effect) for an additional 28 weeks. We then checked the time it took before their symptoms came back.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe had 676 patients in the first phase and 285 showed improvement. These were then divided into the lurasidone (144 patients) and placebo (141 patients) groups. During the first phase, there was a decrease in the severity of symptoms in those who showed improvement. In the next phase, patients using lurasidone took longer before their symptoms came back compared to the placebo group. This was a 33.7% reduction in the risk of symptoms coming back. At the end of the 28 weeks, 42.2% of the lurasidone group and 51.2% of the placebo group had their symptoms return. During the study, the patients only had minor changes in weight, fat levels, sugar levels, and hormone levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study, which involved multiple treatment centers and used a placebo control group, showed that lurasidone works well in keeping schizophrenia symptoms from returning.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
