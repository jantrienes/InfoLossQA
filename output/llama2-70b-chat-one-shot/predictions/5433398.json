The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

How this multidisciplinary care should be organized and structured has not been studied.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe objective of this article is to address the effectiveness of an integrated multidisciplinary approach versus usual care in MS patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients. Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care. The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty MS patients were included. Median MSIS 29 score decreased over six months in the control group (\u22124.89) and increased in the IMD group (+2.00), with a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.03). However, in the multivariate analysis, after adjustment of HAD-D and INTERMED score, this difference was no longer significant.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis prospective, randomized study is the first attempt to evaluate the multidisciplinary approach in MS patients. The results show that, contrary to our expectations, an integrated multidisciplinary approach is not superior to usual care on QoL.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nPeople with multiple sclerosis (MS) often require care from many different doctors, which can create a complex system for managing their health. We don't yet know the best way to organize this type of team-based care.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study aims to find out if coordinating these multiple specialists in an integrated approach is more effective than the regular forms of care for MS patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a study with MS patients, comparing two different methods of care. The first method was a new, integrated team approach where the patients would spend a half-day at the MS clinic going through a comprehensive personal health assessment. The second method was the normal standard of care. We looked at how these two methods affected patients' quality of life (QoL), which was measured with a specific scale, at the start of the trial and after six months.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe involved 50 MS patients in our study. At the end of six months, the regular care group's quality of life score decreased a little, while the integrated care group's quality of life score increased a little. This difference looked significant at first glance. But, when we adjusted for other variables, the difference didn't stand out.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis is the first study trying to evaluate the use of a team-based approach to care for MS patients. Contrary to what we thought, the results show that coordinating multiple specialists in an integrated approach doesn't seem to make a big difference in improving quality of life compared to regular care.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. Annotate the sample above. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nInclude following elements in your annotation:\n- Original: <exact span in original>\n- Simplification: <exact span in simplification> or null for omissions\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nStrictly follow the above json format.
