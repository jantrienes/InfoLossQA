The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The purpose of this study is to characterize, in vivo, carotid arterial structural and functional changes by applying radio frequency and X-strain ultrasound techniques.\n\nMETHODS.\nNinety-one subjects were assigned into two groups; a diabetes group and a control group. Structural and functional changes in the common carotid arterial wall were investigated by quality intima-media thickness (QIMT), quality arterial stiffness (QAS), and X-strain analysis with a Mylab Twice ultrasound instrument. The relationships among variables between the two groups were analyzed in this study.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was no significant difference in carotid IMT (626.5 \u00b1 169.1 \u03bcm vs. 568.5 \u00b1 122.6 \u03bcm, P = 0.1506) between two groups. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and stiffness index (\u03b2) were remarkably greater (8.388 \u00b1 3.254 m/s vs. 7.269 \u00b1 1.332 m/s; 12.51 \u00b1 14.16 vs.9.279 \u00b1 2.871), while compliance coefficient (CC) decreased significantly in the diabetes group (0.802 \u00b1 0.3094 mm2/Kpa vs. 0.968 \u00b1 0.3992 mm2/Kpa) (P < 0.05). The displacement difference of radial (RD-D), longitudinal (LD-D) and rotation (ROT-D) directions were significantly different between two groups' comparison (P = 0.0212, P = 0.0235 and P = 0.0072, respectively). The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) and the time of radial peak strain rate (RSR-T) were found to be significantly different between the two groups (341.9 \u00b1 77.56 ms vs. 369.0 \u00b1 78.26 ms, P = 0.0494; 142.7 \u00b1 22.43 ms vs. 136.2 \u00b1 30.70 ms, P = 0.0474). CS-TD and RSR-T were also found to be positively correlated with CC value (r = 0.3908, P < 0.005 and r = 0.3027, P = 0.0326, respectively). Finally, PWV was negatively correlated with CC with (r = \u20130.6177, P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn type 2 diabetes, the functional changes in CCA can be identified using the methods presented in this article earlier than the structural changes. Arterial stiffness values provided by QAS and X-strain analysis can be used as indicators of CCA functional lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are more likely to suffer from heart diseases because diabetes can cause the arteries to become stiff. This particular study attempts to study these arterial changes in detail by using two different techniques that use sound waves.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe test involved 91 individuals who were divided into two groups: one with diabetes and one without (the control group). By using a device that transmitted sound waves, we studied changes in the wall of an artery in the neck known as the carotid artery. We then compared the findings of the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe thickness of the wall of the carotid artery was pretty similar in both groups. However, the speed at which the pulse travelled and the stiffness of the artery were notably higher in the group with diabetes, whereas the artery's flexibility was significantly lower. The differences in how the arteries moved and adjusted were also significant between the two groups. Additionally, the time taken for certain changes to happen in the arteries were significantly different between the two groups. These time measures were also found to be linked positively with the flexibility of the arteries, whereas the pulse speed was linked negatively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, we can identify functional changes in the carotid artery earlier than structural changes by using the methods described in this study. This suggests the degree of stiffness and elasticity of the artery can serve as indicators of functional issues in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
