The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Statins increase PCSK9 levels; the effects of nonstatin lipid\u2010lowering therapies are unclear. Every\u20104\u2010weeks dosing of alirocumab may be appropriate for some patients in absence of background statin but is not yet approved.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nLow\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), PCSK9, and alirocumab levels were assessed in subjects (LDL\u2010C >130 mg/dL, n=24/group) after a 4\u2010week run\u2010in taking oral ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or ezetimibe placebo, when alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (days 1, 29, and 57) was added. Maximal mean LDL\u2010C reductions from day \u22121 baseline (prealirocumab) occurred on day 71 in all groups: alirocumab plus placebo, 47.4%; alirocumab plus ezetimibe, 56.6%; and alirocumab plus fenofibrate, 54.3%. LDL\u2010C reductions were sustained through day 85 with alirocumab plus placebo (47.0%); the duration of effect was slightly diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with ezetimibe (49.6%) or fenofibrate combinations (43.2%). Free PCSK9 concentrations were lowest at day 71 in all groups, then increased over time; by day 85, free PCSK9 concentrations were higher, and alirocumab levels lower, with alirocumab plus fenofibrate, and to a lesser extent alirocumab plus ezetimibe, versus alirocumab plus placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAlirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks produced maximal LDL\u2010C reductions of 47% in combination with placebo and 54% to 57% in combination with ezetimibe or fenofibrate. The oral lipid\u2010lowering therapies appear to increase PCSK9 levels, leading to increased alirocumab clearance. Although the duration of effect was modestly diminished with alirocumab plus ezetimibe/fenofibrate versus placebo, the effect was less than observed in trials with background statins, and it would not preclude the use of alirocumab every 4 weeks in patients taking these nonstatin lipid\u2010lowering therapies concomitantly.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study investigates alirocumab, a drug used to lower cholesterol levels in the body. The effect of alirocumab can be influenced by other substances in the body like PCSK9, which can increase when a person is on certain medications like statins. This study examines how alirocumab operates when interacting with other cholesterol-lowering drugs that are not statins. \n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nThe study reported the impact of alirocumab with cholesterol-lowering substances (ezetimibe, fenofibrate) in people with high cholesterol levels. Also, how the effects of alirocumab last was assessed. They gave alirocumab to people for 4 weeks combined with other substances. The results showed that alirocumab helped in reducing cholesterol levels in the body, the decreases lifted over time, particularly when alirocumab was used with fenofibrate and ezetimibe.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOverall, alirocumab was effective in reducing cholesterol when used alone or with other cholesterol-reducing substances. Even though there were slight decreases in the drug's effectiveness over time when used with ezetimibe or fenofibrate, these interactions would still allow for alirocumab to be used every 4 weeks in patients undergoing treatment with these drugs.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
