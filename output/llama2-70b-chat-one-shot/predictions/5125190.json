The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

We designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nA total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. The intensity of pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine than those receiving saline (P < 0.012).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPre-treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was found to be as effective as lignocaine in reducing propofol injection-induced pain.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\nThe drug Propofol, often used to put people to sleep before surgeries, can sometimes cause mild to severe pain when injected. In our study, we wanted to see if adding two different drugs, methylprednisolone and lignocaine, could reduce this pain. We tested this on patients about to undergo heart surgery.\n\nWHAT WE DID\nWe had 165 adult patients who were going to have non-emergency heart surgery. We split them into three groups: one group was given a harmless saline solution (55 people), one was given 20 mg of lignocaine (55 people), and the last was given 125 mg of methylprednisolone (also 55 people). We administered the drugs after applying a tourniquet and let it stay for 1 min before giving 1/4th of the typical Propofol dose. We then asked the patients to rate their pain when the Propofol was injected.\n\nRESULTS\nAbout 71% of the patients given only the saline solution experienced pain. For the group given lignocaine, the pain was reduced to about 31%. And for those given methylprednisolone, the pain was further lowered to about 36%. The added drugs significantly reduced the pain when compared to just the saline solution (we used statistical tests to confirm this).\n\nWHAT WE CONCLUDED\nAdding the drug methylprednisolone to Propofol before surgery was as effective as adding lignocaine in reducing the pain of the injection.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
