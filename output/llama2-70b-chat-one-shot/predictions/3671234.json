The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Several adjuvants have been tried along with local anesthetic for prolonging the duration of analgesia. In this study, we have observed the effect of midazolam as an adjuvant in patients undergoing infraumbilical surgery. In this prospective, randomized, double blinded, and parallel group and open label study of 90 adult patients aged 18\u201360 years, of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II, scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery, were randomly allocated in two groups. Each patient in group \"B\" received hyperbaric bupivacaine 12.5 mg along with 0.4 mL of normal saline in the subarachnoid block, and patients of group \"BM\" received 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine along with preservative free midazolam 0.4 mL (2 mg). We found that use of midazolam as adjuvant with the local anesthetic in spinal anaesthesia significantly increases the duration of analgesia (median 320 min versus 220 min) and motor block (median 255 min versus 195 min) but decreases the incidence of postoperative nausea-vomiting (PONV).\n\n### Simplification\nSpinal anesthesia is often used during surgeries below the belly button, like a C-section or a hernia operation. But one of the pain-relief medicine's biggest drawbacks is that it doesn't work for long after surgery. Several other medicines have been tried with the aim of making it last longer. In this study, we wanted to see what effect the drug midazolam would have if used along with the anesthetic in these lower body surgeries.\n\nThe study involved 90 adult patients, aged 18 to 60, who were already scheduled for such a surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group was given the normal anesthetic along with a saline solution. The second group received the same anesthetic, but with midazolam added.\n\nOur findings showed that adding midazolam to the anesthetic used in spinal anesthesia made the pain relief last longer (on average, 320 minutes compared to 220 minutes) and also made the numbness last longer (averaging 255 minutes versus 195 minutes). It also reduced the occurrence of nausea and vomiting after surgery.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.

It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.
