The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal NV areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal NV areas were compared before and after the injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nSeven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal NV secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). In group I, the preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 \u00b1 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 \u00b1 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 \u00b1 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). The corneal NV area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 \u00b1 4.33% to 6.72 \u00b1 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal NV area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 \u00b1 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 \u00b1 11.64%, p = 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal NV compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal NV require further investigation.\n\n### Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis study aims to compare the short-term effects of two kinds of injections, namely, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, on the shrinking of unusual blood vessels in the cornea (the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the eye).\n\nMETHODS.\nSixteen patients suffering from abnormal blood vessels in the cornea were randomly chosen to receive one of either a bevacizumab or ranibizumab injection. They were checked before the injection, a week after the injection, and a month after the injection to measure how much their blood vessels shrunk. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe patients, aged around 51, developed abnormal blood vessels in the cornea due to various reasons like eye infections or chemical burns. After the bevacizumab injection, a clear reduction in unusual blood vessels was noticed both a week and a month after the treatment. The ranibizumab injection also resulted in reduced abnormal vessels after a week, but the change was not significant a month later. In group 1, treated with bevacizumab, the shrinkage in unusual vessels was significantly higher than in group 2, treated with ranibizumab.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study concluded that bevacizumab injection was more effective in reducing the unusual blood vessel growth in the cornea compared to the ranibizumab injection. However, further research is needed to understand the effectiveness and the right dosage of these two treatments.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
