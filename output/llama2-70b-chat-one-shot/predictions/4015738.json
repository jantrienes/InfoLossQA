The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days.

Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid\u2013base equilibrium, and the renal function.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from urinary sample.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9. The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid\u2013base equilibrium and higher level of NGAL.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes, acid\u2013base equilibrium, kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT01320891).\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis experiment aims to study the effects of two different types of intravenous fluids used during surgery \u2013 \u2018balanced\u2019 and \u2018unbalanced\u2019. There are concerns that the traditional 'unbalanced' fluid could lead to inflammation, change of blood electrolyte levels, acidity issues, and potentially harm the kidneys. 'Balanced' fluids may reduce these impacts.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe experiment is conducted in a double-blind format, meaning neither the patients nor the doctors knew which fluid was being used. The study included 40 patients undergoing major bowel cancer surgery. They were divided into two groups. One group received 'balanced' fluids, and the other received 'unbalanced' fluids. Measurements of several variables were taken at four different time points during and after surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe group that received 'balanced' fluids had higher levels of certain proteins that are linked to lower inflammation and lower levels of a protein that can indicate tissue damage. The group receiving 'unbalanced' fluids had issues with chloride, calcium, and magnesium levels, more acid-base imbalance, and higher levels of a marker for kidney damage.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing 'balanced' fluids during surgery caused less upset in the body's blood chemicals and acid-base balance and was kinder to kidney function. It might also start an early anti-inflammatory response.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under the reference number NCT01320891.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
