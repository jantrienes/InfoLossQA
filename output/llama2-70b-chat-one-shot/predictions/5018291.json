The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

Post-operative pain scores were compared between groups as the primary objective. Comparison of Sedation Scores, rescue analgesic consumption, time to the first rescue analgesics administration, hemodynamic and SpO2 values were regarded as the secondary objective.\n\nRESULTS.\nMean VAS scores in the first 30 min and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 h of post-operative period were significantly lower in groups BK1 and BK2 in comparison with the other groups (P < 0.05). Also, time to first rescue analgesics administration was longer in the same groups (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nInfiltration of ketamine plus bupivacaine provides superior analgesic effects in PCNL surgery compared with other methods.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nResearchers have been increasingly exploring the use of ketamine - a drug known to relieve pain - for reducing post-surgery discomfort.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of injecting ketamine directly into the bloodstream, in addition to combined use with another painkiller called bupivacaine, in subsiding pain after a specific kidney stone removal surgery (tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\n100 patients slated for kidney stone removal were randomly categorized into five groups. Each group received different treatment procedures - some received saline solutions, some received bupivacaine, while others were given varying doses of ketamine or a mix of ketamine and bupivacaine. The main goal was to compare the different groups' pain levels after surgery. Other factors such as the level of consciousness, the use of extra painkillers, timing of additional painkiller use, and their overall vital signs were also inspected.\n\nRESULTS:\nPatients that received a combination of bupivacaine and ketamine (both in lower and higher doses) reported lower pain levels within the first half-hour following surgery, and consumed fewer additional painkillers during the first day after surgery, compared to other groups. After surgery, these patients also were granted a longer time before needing extra painkillers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nApplying a mix of ketamine and bupivacaine proved better at relieving pain after kidney stone removal compared to other methods.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
