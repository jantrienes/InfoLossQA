The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n### Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n### Missing information in simplification [/INST] [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\",\n        \"simplification\": \"The study\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a 'study'.\",\n        \"question\": \"How did the study control for bias?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\",\n        \"simplification\": \"low vitamin D levels\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\",\n        \"question\": \"How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"imprecise/fuzzy concepts\",\n        \"original\": \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\",\n        \"simplification\": \"a survey about participant's quality of life\",\n        \"rationale\": \"The specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\",\n        \"question\": \"What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases.\",\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"omission\",\n        \"original\": \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\",\n        \"simplification\": null,\n        \"rationale\": \"The simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\",\n        \"question\": \"Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\",\n        \"answer\": \"The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases.

The study was randomized, observer blind, multicenter, and stratified by age (6\u201323 months and 24\u201335 months), and it accounted for prior influenza immunization status.\n\nRESULTS.\nThree hundred seventy-four children were in the total vaccinated cohort (study vaccine 0.25-mL dose, n\u00a0=\u00a0164; 0.50-mL dose, n\u00a0=\u00a0167; comparator 0.25\u00a0mL, n\u00a0=\u00a043). Regulatory criteria for immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in adults were met for all virus strains and doses for both age strata. A modest but not statistically significant improvement in immune responses was observed with the higher dose and reactogenicity, and safety of the 2 doses was not significantly different.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe 0.5-mL dose of the study vaccine, when administered to children aged 6\u201335 months, resulted in a modest but not statistically significant improvement in immunogenicity with clinically similar safety and reactogenicity compared with the 0.25-mL dose. Further studies comparing full- and half-dose influenza vaccine in young children are needed.\n\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION.\nNCT00778895.\n\n### Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nWe're trying to find better ways to vaccinate babies and young children against the flu.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested a flu vaccine (that doesn't contain a preservative called thimerosal) at two different amounts (0.50ml and 0.25ml) in kids aged between 6 and 35 months. Our study was designed and conducted carefully, with the researcher not knowing who received what amount of the vaccine. We also considered what flu shots the children had had before.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe tested the vaccine on 374 children. The effectiveness (how well it boosts the immune system) of the vaccine for all three virus strains in the vaccine met the standards set for adults, and it didn't matter how much of the vaccine the kids got or how old they were. We found a small improvement in the immune response with the larger dose, but the difference wasn't significant. The two different doses had similar safety levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nGiving kids aged 6-35 months the larger dose (0.5ml) of this flu vaccine made a small improvement, but it wasn't a significant difference. Importantly, it was equally safe and well-tolerated as the smaller dose (0.25ml). We need more studies testing larger and smaller amounts of flu vaccine in young children.\n\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION.\nYou can look up the details of our study using the identifier NCT00778895.\n\n\n### Instructions\nThis annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process.
