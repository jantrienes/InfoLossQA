The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.

How did metformin's effectiveness in suppressing sVCAM-1 levels compare to liraglutide's?\n5. Besides regulating sugar and fats, is liraglutide associated with any other benefits for diabetic patients?\n6. Does liraglutide have any potential benefits related to inflammation?\n7. What format was the supplementary material provided in?\n8. Was there any additional material provided along with the study's main findings?\n9.

Who can access the supplementary material provided with the study?\n12. How were the children divided into the Taekwondo and control groups?\n13. What was the duration of each Taekwondo training session?\n14. What type of fitness test was conducted to measure the children's balance?\n15. How did the Taekwondo group and the control group compare in terms of balance as indicated by the Stork test results?\n16. What was the level of statistical significance for these tests and evaluations?\n17. How did the children's sociability scores compare before and after the Taekwondo classes?\n18. Was the increase in sociability score after the intervention statistically significant?\n19. Was the improvement in balance as indicated by the Stork test statistically significant?\n20. Who specifically is the Griffithsin gel being tested for?\n21. How important is the study of the Griffithsin gel?\n22. Beyond the effects on proteins, what else did the researchers study in their evaluation of the Griffithsin gel?\n23. How many monkeys were used in the study and what species were they?\n24. What was the concentration of Griffithsin in the gels used in the study?\n25. What technology did the scientists use to evaluate the impact of the gel on proteins?\n26. How did the researchers study the changes in the microbiome?\n27. What function do the proteins affected by the dummy gels have?\n28. What beneficial microbes increased after the application of the dummy gels?\n29. What were the effects of the Griffithsin gel and the dummy gels compared to?\n30. What does the study say about the safety of the Griffithsin gel?\n31. What is the intended use of the 0.1% Griffithsin gel?\n32. What type of clinical trial was conducted?"}]}
