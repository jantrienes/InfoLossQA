The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What condition is this treatment of normobaric hyperoxia or pure oxygen used for?\n2. When is the treatment of normobaric hyperoxia or pure oxygen applied to the patients?\n3. In what position is the posterior fossa surgery performed on the patients?\n4. How effective is the administration of normobaric hyperoxia or pure oxygen in treating pneumocephalus?\n5. Is the medical trial registered and if yes, what is the identifier?\n6. What happens if a woman needs a prostaglandin for cervical ripening?\n7. Are there any social implications for using a prostaglandin for cervical ripening?\n8. What type of research was carried out to investigate the use of balloon catheter for cervical ripening?\n9. What was one of the objectives of the pilot randomised trial?\n10. What was the ratio in which women were split into the at-home and in-hospital treatment groups?\n11. How many women participated in the at-home ripening process usinig a balloon catheter?\n12. How many women underwent the hospital-based procedure using a double-balloon catheter?\n13. Was the study suited to find statistically significant differences between the groups?\n14. What were some of the key outcomes in the study?\n15. When was feedback collected from the women who participated in the study?\n16. From whom was feedback sought at the end of the study?\n17. How did most of the women feel about the insertion of the catheter?\n18. Was there a difference in the need for oxytocin between the at-home and in-hospital groups?\n19. How did women in the at-home group feel emotionally compared to women in the hospital group?\n20. How do most midwives and doctors feel about sending a woman home with a balloon catheter compared to with prostaglandins?\n21. What is the registration number of the trial?\n22. How extensive is the past research on the relation between chronic consumption of alcohol and H. pylori infection?\n23. What other factors were measured in the study besides BMI and inflammation markers? \n24. Were the levels of interleukin (IL)-10 also measured during the study?\n25. What are some other inflammation markers that were measured during the study?\n26. Were there other cytokines measured in the study besides IL-10?\n27. Were markers of cell damage also measured during the study?\n28. Was the activity of any compounds measured during the study?\n29. How were all these different proteins and substances measured in the study?\n30. Was the age factor taken into account while dividing the subjects into groups?\n31. Were there any other factors that were made comparable among the groups?\n32. Was the age at which the subjects began drinking alcohol considered while dividing them into groups?"}]}
