The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. How were patients assigned to either the PVB group or the control group?\n2. How was the severity of the patient's pain assessed in this study?\n3. What was the average pain score of patients at rest in the PVB group?\n4. How severe was the pain for the control group while at rest?\n5. What was the pain score recorded for the PVB group when they moved?\n6. What pain levels were observed for the control group when they moved after surgery?\n7. What types of opioid medications were given to patients in this study?\n8. How much tramadol did the PVB group consume on average 24 hours after surgery?\n9. Was the single-shot thoracic PVB the only method utilized for pain relief in this study? \n10. What database did the researchers use for this study?\n11. What was one of the main aims of this study, in relation to salivary gland cancer patients?\n12. What specific treatment was the study investigating for its impact on the survival of these patients?\n13. How many patients with major salivary gland cancer were examined in this study?\n14. Where were the patient records sourced from for this study?\n15. What type of primary treatment did all the patients receive in this study?\n16. What is one condition that would categorize a patient as high risk in this study?\n17. What is another factor that could classify a patient as high risk in this study?\n18. What is one of the factors that would put a patient in the intermediate risk category in this study?\n19. What is another criterion for classifying a patient as intermediate risk in this study?\n20. For how long were the patients tracked on average in this study?\n21. What was the hazard ratio recorded for the high-risk group in this study?\n22. Which group of patients does the study suggest would benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy?\n23. Why couldn't the researchers analyze the local impact of additional radiation treatment in this study?\n24. Are there any challenges faced in getting patients to participate in cardiac rehabilitation?\n25. What kind of support was offered to patients doing home-based cardiac rehabilitation?\n26. How long did the rehabilitation study last?\n27. Did the patients\u2019 physical fitness show any improvement after the completion of the cardiac rehabilitation program?\n28. Was the improvement in physical fitness at the end of the rehab program significant?\n29. Did patients' physical fitness still show improvement a year after the rehab program?\n30. What was the willingness-to-pay for a higher probability of cost-effectiveness in the rehabilitation program?\n31. How was the cost-effectiveness of the rehabilitation program measured?\n32. What was the status of the patients when they enrolled in the study?"}]}
