The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What percentage of the portion-controlled diet group lost 10% of their starting weight?\n2. Was the difference in the percentage of participants who lost 10% of their starting weight between the portion-controlled diet group and the diabetes management group statistically significant?\n3. By how much did the blood sugar levels decrease in the portion-controlled diet group?\n4. What was the interval for the decrease in blood sugar levels for participants on the portion-controlled diet?\n5. Was the decrease in blood sugar levels in the portion-controlled diet group significantly greater than in the diabetes management group?\n6. How are weight loss and the decrease in blood sugar levels related? \n7. Can the portion-controlled meal plan lead to weight loss according to the findings of the study?\n8. Who provides management for obesity in primary care?\n9. How were the patients in the study selected?\n10. What was the anticipated outcome for the patients in this study?\n11. Can you specify the sizes of the needles used for the egg collection in this study?\n12. What classification was given to the 20 G/ 35 mm needle used in the study?\n13. And what about the 17 G/ 35 mm needle? How can we describe it?\n14.  Apart from the standard size needle, what other type of needle was used to collect the eggs in this study?\n15. Was there a relationship between a woman's weight and the number of eggs collected, and how strong was it?\n16. Did the use of a thinner needle have a noteworthy impact on the length of the procedure?\n17. Does the conclusion about needle size and number of eggs collected apply to overweight women as well?\n18. What about women with fewer eggs left, does the same conclusion hold for them?\n19. What kind of method was used in the study to assign the patients to different treatment groups?\n20. Did the group of patients who had surgery while lying on their back experience any complications post-surgery?\n21. Who typically receives Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) treatment, and for what type of injury?\n22. What effects did the insufflation of CO2 have in previous models?\n23. What specific type of neurons is activated by the insufflation of CO2 that could potentially result in pain relief?\n24. What is believed to be activated as a result of inhaling CO2 that could provide pain relief benefits?\n25. Which type of neurons is involved in the experience of craniofacial pain?\n26. How can inhaling CO2 potentially impact the neurons involved in craniofacial pain?\n27. Through what process are the effects of CO2 insufflation likely to be channeled?\n28. Where in the body are these TRPV1 receptor-positive neurons located?\n29. What happens as a result of activating TRPV1 receptor-positive neurons?\n30. What is one of the central inhibitory effects caused by the activation of TRPV1 receptor-positive neurons?\n31. Was the experiment unique or had similar ones been conducted before?\n32. Why was capsaicin administered into the nose in this study?"}]}
