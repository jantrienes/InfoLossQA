The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Has any research been done on how this medicine might work on the inflammatory cytokines in the body\u2019s immune system through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis?\n2. Where did the stroke occur in the patients this medicine was given to?\n3. What part of the body is the effect of the butylphthalide sodium chloride injection being measured on?\n4. How were the patients divided into the group that got the medicine and the group that didn't?\n5. Did they measure any hormone levels apart from adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in patients?\n6. How did they measure the hormone levels and stroke symptoms in the patients? \n7. Where was the stroke, or cerebral infarction, detected in the patients\u2019 brains?\n8. Was there a way to measure the symptoms of stroke in the group that got the medicine?\n9. Were ACTH levels measured in the group that didn't get the medicine?\n10. Was there a significant difference in ACTH levels between the group that got the medicine and the group that didn't? \n11. Was there a way to measure the symptoms of stroke in the group that didn't get the medicine?\n12. Were cortisol levels measured in the group that got the medicine?\n13. Was the collected data from the hormone measurements and the stroke test scores processed or computed in any way? \n14. Which software was used to compute the data collected from the hormone measurements and the stroke test scores?\n15. Which software was used to analyze the computed data?\n16. What kind of stroke do patients usually get the butylphthalide treatment for?\n17. What effect does butylphthalide treatment have on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients?\n18. Why is breastfeeding beneficial for babies in terms of their health?\n19. What can you tell me about the current rates of breastfeeding?\n20. Have there been any efforts to encourage more mothers to breastfeed?\n21. Despite these public health efforts, have breastfeeding rates increased significantly?\n22. When will the rate of breastfeeding be measured during the study?\n23. How were the babies divided into the two groups?\n24. What exactly did the CLF intervention entail?\n25. How long did the CLF intervention last?\n26. Were precautions taken when analyzing statistical data in the study?\n27. How many newborns were analyzed in the CLF group?\n28. Did the study only look at exclusive breastfeeding rates?\n29. What was the p-value for exclusive breastfeeding rates when the mothers and babies left the hospital?\n30. What was the p-value for the rates of any breastfeeding at the time of discharge from the hospital?\n31. How did the researchers measure the newborns' weight loss during the study?\n32. How much weight, on average, did the infants in the CLF group lose while they were in the hospital?"}]}
