The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Were there any patients who had a grade 3 or 4 view of the throat area, according to the Cormack-Lehane scale, when using the Airtraq laryngoscope?\n2. How did the performance of the Airtraq laryngoscope compare to the McCoy and Macintosh laryngoscopes in the study?\n3. What type of clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different care strategies for MS patients?\n4. How were the MS patients assigned to the different care strategies in the trial? \n5.  How many centers participated in the clinical trial?\n6. Can you describe one of the care strategies studied in the trial?\n7.  What does the integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach involve?\n8. How was the patient's quality of life measured in the trial?\n9. How did the median MSIS 29 scores change in the control group over the course of the trial?\n10. How significant was the difference in quality of life scores between the two treatment strategies?\n11. Did the difference in quality of life scores between the two groups remain significant after adjusting for other variables?\n12. Can you describe the study design of the clinical trial?\n13. For which eye surgery is postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) commonly observed? \n14. Apart from eye enucleation, is there another surgery where postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly observed?\n15. What kind of trial was conducted in the study?\n16. Apart from reducing the incident of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), what is another potential benefit of using a lower dose of palonosetron in combination with droperidol?\n17. What health classifications were the patients in, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists?\n18. Apart from eye enucleation, what other type of eye surgery were the patients in the study scheduled for?\n19. What dosage of palonosetron was administered to the patients in the P2.5 group?\n20.

What percentage of patients in Group P2.5 did not experience any nausea or vomiting at all throughout the study? \n30. How many patients in Group P7.5 were completely free of nausea and vomiting throughout the study? \n31. Was there a significant difference among the treatment groups in the proportion of patients who did not experience any nausea or vomiting?\n32.
