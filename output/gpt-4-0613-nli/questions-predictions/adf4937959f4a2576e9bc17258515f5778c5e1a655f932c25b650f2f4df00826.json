The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What other eye symptoms were observed as secondary outcomes in the study?\n2. How significant was the reduction in ocular itching?\n3. How effective was the eye drop over time?\n4. What was the main symptom the BBOS 1.5% eyedrop aimed to alleviate? \n5. How many patients did the study include?\n6. How were these patients grouped for the study?\n7. What treatment did one of the groups in the study receive?\n8. What dosage of the hypertonic saline solution did the patients receive?\n9. What treatment did the second group receive?\n10. How much normal saline did the second group receive?\n11. How long did the infusion of saline solutions take?\n12. Was any demographic information gathered from the patients?\n13. Did the study consider the patient's Body Mass Index (BMI)?\n14. Were any vital signs checked for patients in the study?\n15. Other than Systolic Blood Pressure, did the researchers check any other blood pressure measures from the patients?\n16. Did the researchers check the heart rate of the patients?\n17. Did the study monitor the average pressure in the arteries of the patients?\n18. What was the range of different ages of the patients in this study?\n19. Were there any differences in blood pressure right after the saline solutions were given?\n20. What does a p-value greater than 0.05 mean?\n21. What does a p-value less than 0.05 mean?\n22. Were there significant trends over time in the data?\n23. At what time was the hypertonic saline given to the patients?\n24. What dose of the hypertonic saline solution was given to the patients?\n25. How did the administration of hypertonic saline affect the average pressure in the arteries?\n26. How was the heart rate affected by the hypertonic saline infusion?\n27. Were there any severe episodes of low blood pressure after the hypertonic saline was given?\n28. Can you tell me more about the method of giving the children oxygen in this study?\n29. Were there specific conditions that the oxygen needed to meet before being given to the babies?\n30. Was there a specific temperature the oxygen needed to be before being delivered to the babies?\n31. How important were the conditions of 100% relative humidity and a temperature of 37\u00b0C for the oxygen therapy?\n32. Were the devices used in this study approved by a health authority?"}]}
