The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Was there a significant difference in the productivity at home between the patients who took CZP and those who took the placebo?\n2. How much improvement did the patients who took the placebo report in their productivity at home?\n3. Can we refer to this study using a specific identifier?\n4. What type of studies usually uses identifiers that start with 'NCT'?\n5. Apart from investigating the connection between selenium levels and high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy, what was another aim of the study?\n6. When was the research about selenium levels and high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy conducted?\n7. What was the source of the samples used in the selenium study?\n8. How were the selection of women for treatment or placebo determined in the SPRINT study?\n9. How much selenium was given to the women in the treatment group of the SPRINT study?\n10. When was the first measurement of selenium concentration in the women's blood taken during the study?\n11. When was the selenium concentration in the women's blood measured for the second time in the study?\n12. When was the toenail selenium concentration measurement taken in the study?\n13. Apart from the measurement of selenium concentration in the blood, was there any other measurements taken at 35 weeks into the women's pregnancy in the study? \n14. Were there standard intervals for measuring the activity of plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) in the study? \n15. Besides taking measurements during the pregnancy, when else did researchers collect data for the selenium study?\n16. What was the questionnaire completed by the pregnant women in the study?\n17. How did the activity level of the GPx3 enzyme in UK pregnant women compare to those in US and Australian pregnant women in the study?\n18. What was the baseline concentration of SEPP1, the protein known to transport selenium, in UK pregnant women in the study?\n19. What was the median SEPP1 concentration in the blood of UK pregnant women in the study?\n20. What was the range of SEPP1 concentration in the blood of UK pregnant women in the study?\n21. Did the researchers make any changes to the measurement of selenium concentration in the blood of women in the study?\n22. Did the intake of Brazil nuts influence the concentration of selenium in the blood of the pregnant women in the study?\n23. Did the intake of seafood impact the concentration of selenium in the blood of the pregnant women in the study?\n24. What kind of statistical model was employed in the study to assess the selenium-related risk factors?\n25. Among the selenium-related risk factors, which one significantly influenced the odds ratio for developing high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy?\n26. What was the odds ratio for toenail selenium concentration in the study?\n27. What was the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio of toenail selenium concentration in the study? \n28. What was the p-value for the effect of toenail selenium concentration on the odds of developing high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy?\n29. What does a p-value less than 0.05 indicate in a study?\n30. What was the effect of selenium supplementation on the odds of developing high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy in the study?\n31. What was the odds ratio of developing high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy with selenium supplementation in the study?\n32. What was the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio of selenium supplementation in the study?"}]}
