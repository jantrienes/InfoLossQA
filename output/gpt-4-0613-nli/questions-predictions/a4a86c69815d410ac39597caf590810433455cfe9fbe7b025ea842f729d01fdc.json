The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the p-value of the analysis for early treatment failure across the three groups?\n2. In which group was the PCF28 corrected for re-infection lower?\n3. What was the PCF28 rate corrected for re-infection in the AL group?\n4. How about the PCF28 corrected for re-infection in the AS+CD group?\n5. What was the p-value for the comparison of PCF28 corrected for re-infection between the groups?\n6. Which treatment is considered as the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria?\n7. What kind of probes does the test, fluorescence in situ hybridization, use to differentiate between bacteria?\n8. What kind of bacteria is the PNA-FISH test trying to differentiate Staphylococcus aureus from?\n9. How is the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria different from the other bacteria tested by PNA-FISH?\n10. How do we know the difference in survival rates between the two groups of patients was not just due to chance?\n11. By how much were the patients able to reduce their use of antibiotics?\n12. How can we be sure that the reduction in antibiotic use was not just a random event?\n13. Have other studies been done about blood flow during risky surgeries?\n14. What kind of surgeries were the patients undergoing in the study?\n15. Is the goal of maintaining a healthy blood flow during major surgeries achievable?\n16. In the study, what specific type of blood pressure variation was minimized?\n17. What was the nature of the study conducted - was it looking forward into the future or analyzing past data?\n18. Did the study randomly assign patients to the treatment and control groups?\n19. Was the study conducted at multiple locations?\n20. What was the main outcome that the researchers were examining in the study?\n21. What was the second group of patients subject to in the study?\n22. How were the blood pressure changes of the patients monitored during surgery in the study?\n23. To what extent was the arterial pulse pressure (\u0394PP) minimized in the intervention group during the study?\n24. How was the arterial pulse pressure (\u0394PP) minimized in the intervention group?\n25. Were the two groups of patients similar in their overall health condition as determined by the American Society of Anesthesiology score?\n26. How much fluid was given to the intervention group during surgery?\n27. How much fluid was given to the control group during surgery?\n28. To what kind of surgeries does the statement mainly refer?\n29. How were the patients divided into the two groups?\n30. How soon did patients in the active group leave the hospital after having their pacemaker replaced?\n31. What is the technical term used in the study for major negative events related to treatment?\n32. What percentage of patients in the active group experienced one or more major negative events related to their treatment?"}]}
