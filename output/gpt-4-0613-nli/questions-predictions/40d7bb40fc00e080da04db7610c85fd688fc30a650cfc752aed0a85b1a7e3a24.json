The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What specific oxygen therapy can the approved devices provide?\n2. Do these devices have the ability to warm the oxygen before delivery?\n3. What type of research study was conducted?\n4. What was the health condition of the newborns in this study?\n5. How was the initial therapy delivered to the babies in the study?\n6. What was the concentration of oxygen given to the newborns during the initial therapy?\n7. How were the babies divided for the study?\n8. How many babies were in each group of the study?\n9. What treatment did the babies receive after the initial nasal mask therapy?\n10. What device was used to deliver oxygen therapy to the babies in one of the groups?\n11. What device was used to deliver oxygen therapy to the babies in the other group?\n12. Did the researchers compare how often the babies needed to go back to the initial therapy?\n13. Did the study also compare any breathing problems between the two groups of babies?\n14. Was the presence of chronic lung disease among the babies also compared in the study?\n15. Did the study consider any injuries to the nose from the oxygen therapy?\n16. Did the researchers measure moisture levels in the oxygen being delivered to the babies?\n17. Was there a difference in how long the babies were kept on the heated and humidified nasal cannula therapy between the two groups?\n18. Was there a difference in the need for the babies to go back to the nasal mask therapy between the two groups?\n19. Was there a difference in the requirement for more serious breathing support, such as invasive ventilation, between the two groups?\n20. Did there happen to be a difference in the occurrence of breath pauses, or apnea, between the two groups?\n21. Was there a difference in nose injuries from the oxygen therapy between the two groups?\n22. Was there a difference in the occurrence of chronic lung disease between the two groups of babies?\n23. Did the study find any major differences between the two groups of babies?\n24. Was there a difference in the temperature and moisture levels of the oxygen delivered by the two systems?\n25. How was the treatment administered to the rats?\n26. Which parts of the rats' bodies were examined after they were sacrificed?\n27. In addition to femora, were any other part of the rats' bodies examined after they were sacrificed?\n28. What testing was performed on the femora and lumbar vertebrae that were harvested from the rats?\n29. What kind of testing was carried out on the harvested femora and lumbar vertebrae?\n30. Was there a comparison group in this study? If so, what kind of treatment did they receive?\n31. Were there any differences observed in the occurrence of diabetes between the different groups of rats?\n32. What were the effects of Raloxifene in relation to the prevention of diabetes?"}]}
