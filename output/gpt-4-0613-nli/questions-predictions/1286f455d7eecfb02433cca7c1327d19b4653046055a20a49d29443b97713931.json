The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.

What was the difference in the average systolic and diastolic blood pressures among the three groups from a statistical standpoint?\n4. How can successful management of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension be ensured in future programs?\n5. What was another primary goal of the study relating to the calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ)?\n6. Apart from calcium-fortified foods, what other types of foods does the calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) consider?\n7.

What kind of interview approach was used in the study?\n12. What was the correlation value between the calcium measures considered in the study?\n13. How strong was the relationship found between the different measurements for total daily calcium intake?\n14. How sure are we that the correlation found in the study didn't happen by chance?\n15. What was the variability in daily calcium intake estimated by the special questionnaire?\n16. On average, how much daily calcium did the participants report in the 24-hour recall?\n17. What was the variability in daily calcium intake estimated by the 24-hour recall?\n18. Was the difference in calcium intake estimated by the questionnaire and the 24-hour recall significant?\n19. How much correlation was found between underreporting of calcium by the 24-hour recall and increase in daily calcium intake?\n20. What type of statistical analysis was used on the special questionnaire data?\n21. Which different statistical method was used to analyze the special questionnaire's data?\n22. How did the researchers conclude that the special questionnaire was accurate in identifying individuals with low calcium intakes?\n23. What was the correlation between dairy consumption and calcium intake?\n24. How much of a relationship is there between fruit consumption and calcium intake?\n25. What is the correlation between fruit consumption and the amount of calcium intake?\n26. By how much did the questionnaire overestimate daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall?\n27. Is the difference in how much the questionnaire overestimates total calcium for black women statistically significant?\n28. By how much did the questionnaire overestimate the daily calcium intake for white women?\n29.
