The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What type of rats was used in this study?\n2. Where are Artemisinin combination therapies for malaria available?\n3. What might compromise the patient's adherence to the medication regimen for the malaria drug?\n4. What information did the text message reminders given to drug store staff contain?\n5. What type of trial was conducted to see if text messages could improve medication adherence?\n6. Where did the follow-ups on the patients' medication habits take place?\n7. What information was collected from the patients during the follow-up?\n8. Who else were interviewed apart from the patients in this study?\n9. What information was gathered from the interviews with the drug store staff (dispensers)?\n10. How many shops were involved in the study?\n11. What percentage of patients in the group that received text message reminders completed all of their doses?\n12. What percentage of patients in the group that did not receive text message reminders completed all of their doses?\n13. Was there a significant difference between the two groups in terms of completing all doses?\n14. What percentage of patients in the group that received text message reminders took each dose of the medicine at the correct time?\n15. What percentage of patients in the group that did not receive text message reminders took each dose of the medicine at the correct time?\n16. Was there a significant difference between the two groups in terms of taking each dose of the medicine at the correct time?\n17. What is the main goal of conducting these studies involving text message reminders?\n18. Have any scientific studies been conducted to learn more about working memory?\n19. Have these studies identified specific areas in the brain related to working memory?\n20. Who took part in this study?\n21. What type of study was conducted to understand the role of tDCS in working memory?\n22. What type of task did the participants have to perform in this study?\n23. What statistical analysis was used in the study?\n24. Did the statistical analysis show any significant results?\n25. What types of stimulation were compared in the study?\n26. To which part of the brain was the positive electrical charge (anodal stimulation) from the tDCS applied in the study?\n27. How complex was the working memory task that participants had to perform?\n28. Was the effect of the tDCS on memory statistically significant or just by chance?\n29. What was the F-value, a statistic indicating the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance, for the effect of tDCS on memory?\n30. What was the P-value, a measure of the probability that the observed results occurred by chance, for the effect of tDCS on memory?\n31. Did the position of tDCS stimulation or inhibition electrodes have any effect on the results?\n32. Does the position of the electrodes applied during tDCS have an impact on working memory?"}]}
