The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the wavelength of the diode laser used in the study?\n2. How was the diode laser used in the study?\n3. What was the power wattage of the diode laser used in the study?\n4. What treatment was given to Group 3 in the study?\n5. How did they measure the pain levels of the patients?\n6. What was done with the visual analog scale scores from the patients?\n7. To what were the visual analog scale scores compared?\n8. What other tests were the visual analog scale scores compared to?\n9. Were the visual analog scale scores compared to any other types of tests?\n10. How was the treatment carried out in Group 3?\n11. What form of treatment did Group 2 use?\n12. What form of treatment did Group 1 use?\n13. Between the diode laser and the potassium nitrate treatment, which one showed better results?\n14. What statistical method was used in the analysis?\n15. Besides the one-way ANOVA, what other statistical test was used in the analysis?\n16. What did the analysis show about the visual analog scale scores?\n17. What was the level of significance set for the analysis?\n18. What treatment method is recommended based on the results of this study?\n19. For which patients is the combined application of 5% potassium nitrate and diode laser recommended?\n20. How certain are the researchers about their recommendation for treatment?\n21. What components make up the substance located in the center of the human eye?\n22. What is the term for the accumulation of lutein, zeaxanthin, and mesozeaxanthin in the retina?\n23. Are there any supplements that contain the components needed for the macular pigment?\n24. What type of supplement was the first group taking?\n25. What type of supplement was the second group taking?\n26. Which group had a larger increase in the quantity of the macular substance in their eyes?\n27. What was the increase in the macular substance for the group that took the supplement with all three components?\n28. Which group had a smaller increase in the quantity of the macular substance in their eyes?\n29. What was the increase in the macular substance for the group that took the supplement with just lutein?\n30. Was the difference in the increase of macular substance between the two groups statistically significant?\n31. What was the p-value of the statistical test that showed the difference between the two groups?\n32. Was the p-value more or less than the usual threshold for statistical significance which is 0.05?"}]}
