The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Were there different instances of the CT scans conducted on the patients' brains, and how were they referred to?\n2. What does CT1 refer to in the study?\n3. What does CT2 refer to in the study?\n4. What main criteria were examined in the study to measure the outcome?\n5. What was the first primary endpoint assessed in the study?\n6. What was the second primary endpoint assessed in the study?\n7. Aside from the primary endpoints, were there any other criteria evaluated in the study?\n8. What was one of the secondary endpoints evaluated in the study?\n9. How was the alertness level of the patients measured in the study?\n10. When was the patients' alertness level evaluated in the study?\n11. Was anything else apart from alertness level measured as a secondary endpoint in the study?\n12. How was the attention level of the patients measured in the study?\n13. When was the patients' attention level evaluated in the study?\n14. When was the patients' attention level evaluated again?\n15. What condition were the patients suffering from in the study?\n16. How were the patients in the study divided for treatment?\n17. What was being measured in the patients during the study?\n18. How did the mean change in pneumocephalus volume differ between the patients who received the oxygen treatment and those who didn't?\n19. How did the treatment impact the pneumocephalus volume in the control arm patients compared to those in the treatment arm?\n20. How significant was the difference in the mean change in pneumocephalus volume between the two groups?\n21. How did the rate at which the air in the brain was absorbed differ between the two groups of patients?\n22. How did the rate of absorbing air in the brain compare between the group that received oxygen therapy and the group that did not?\n23. How statistically significant was the difference in air resorption rate between the group that received oxygen therapy and the group that did not?\n24. Was there a particular group of patients who experienced more pronounced results from the oxygen therapy?\n25. What test was given to both groups of patients to measure their attention levels?\n26. Did the Stroop test results show any difference in attention levels between the group of patients who received oxygen treatment and the group who did not?\n27. On what scale were the scores of the patients' alertness level distributed?\n28. Was there any difference observed in the average scores of the patients' alertness level?\n29. How significant was the difference observed in the average scores of the patients' alertness level?\n30. At what oxygen concentration is normobaric hyperoxia therapy given?\n31. How is the normobaric hyperoxia or pure oxygen administered to the patients?\n32. How long does the administration of the normobaric hyperoxia or pure oxygen last?"}]}
