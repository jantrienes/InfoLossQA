The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. How many patients were there in the control group?\n2. What proportion of patients in the control group experienced a major adverse event?\n3. What was the P-value for the comparison of adverse events between the control group and the active group?\n4. What was the P-value indicating the significance of the risk reduction?\n5. Was the difference in hospital stay length between patients who left early and those who stayed longer statistically significant?\n6. Who is the target audience of the autism awareness promotion?\n7. What resource was developed in the study to teach about autism?\n8. What kind of educational tool was developed for teaching about autism in this study?\n9. What is Xerte?\n10. What is Flash Macromedia?\n11. Which software was used to create the Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) package on autism?\n12.

What statistical method was used to analyse the data obtained from the two groups?\n15. What level of confidence was used in the statistical analysis of the data from the study?\n16. How did the students who learned about autism through the Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) package perform in terms of retaining the information compared to those who read the leaflet?\n17. What was the p-value for the difference in retention of information between the Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) package and the information leaflet groups? \n18. What was the p-value for the difference in the level of enjoyment between the CAL package and the information leaflet groups?\n19. What was the p-value for the difference in the level of confidence to identify a child with autism between the CAL package and the information leaflet groups?\n20. What topic does the Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) package focus on?\n21. What conditions can Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) cause?\n22. What are the potential long-term effects of Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) if left untreated?\n23. What kind of research design was used in the comparison study of laparoscopic versus open pyeloplasty for treating UPJO?\n24. Over what time period was the study conducted?\n25. What type of procedure was used during the open pyeloplasty surgeries?\n26. What diagnostic method was used to follow up with patients after the surgeries?\n27. When was the DTPA scan performed after the patients' surgeries?\n28. Besides the DTPA scan, what other follow-up method was used for the patients?\n29. When was the Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) performed after the patients' surgeries?\n30. How long, on average, did the laparoscopic surgeries with stent placement take?\n31. What was the shortest time for a laparoscopic surgery with stent placement in this study?\n32. What was the longest time for a laparoscopic surgery with stent placement in this study?"}]}
