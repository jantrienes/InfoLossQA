The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Besides changes in ADHD symptoms, what other measure was used to evaluate improvement?\n2. How much did the ADHD symptoms change in the placebo group of the forced-dose study?\n3. How much did the ADHD symptoms change in the LDX group of the forced-dose study?\n4. What was the change in ADHD symptoms in the OROS-MPH group in the forced-dose study?\n5. How often did treatment-emergent adverse events (side effects that appeared after treatment) occur with LDX in the forced-dose study?\n6. How often did side effects occur with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study?\n7. Which medication worked better in the forced-dose study, LDX or OROS-MPH?\n8. What do these findings say about the effectiveness of psychostimulants (the class of drugs to which LDX and OROS-MPH belong) for treating ADHD?\n9. What was the average age of the participants in the first group?\n10. What type of test was included in the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III assessment?\n11. Were there any subtests related to hearing in the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III assessment?\n12. Was there a subtest that evaluated visual skills in the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III assessment?\n13. Was there a subtest in the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III assessment that measured how quickly participants can make decisions?\n14. How many different conditions were there in which the participants were tested?\n15. Can you provide an example of one of the dual-task experimental conditions?\n16. What was the nature of the second dual-task experimental condition?\n17. Can you describe the third dual-task experimental condition?\n18. What were the auditory tasks related to in these experimental conditions?\n19. What type of visual task was included in every experimental condition?\n20. What type of analysis was used to evaluate the results of this study?\n21. Apart from repeated measures analysis of variance, was there any other type of analysis used in the study?\n22. In what field or context is the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III test usually employed?\n23. How many cases of liver cancer (HCCs) were represented in this study?\n24. What statistical method was used to compare the cancer-free survival rates after 1 and 2 years for both treatment methods?\n25. Was the difference in treatment time between the two groups found to be statistically significant?\n26. Was the amount of energy used in each treatment method different, and if so, was this difference statistically significant?\n27. What was the cancer-free survival rate in the SB-RFA group after 2 years?\n28. What was the cancer-free survival rate in the SM-RFA group after 2 years?\n29. What type of electrodes does the SB-RFA treatment method use?\n30. What do we currently know about strategies to help sexual violence survivors overcome stigma?\n31. Are there any specific settings where the lack of strategies to reduce stigma among sexual violence survivors is especially noticeable?\n32. What kind of mental health issues were reported by the women included in the study?"}]}
