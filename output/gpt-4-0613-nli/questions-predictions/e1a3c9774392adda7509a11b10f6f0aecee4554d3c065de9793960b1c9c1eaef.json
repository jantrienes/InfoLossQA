The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.

What other potential impacts is liraglutide suggested to have besides improving how the body uses sugar and fats? \n8. How is adhesion molecule activation related to diabetes?\n9. Besides the body's use of sugar and fat, what specific substance's effects were examined in the study?\n10. Was the production of insulin by beta cells in the pancreas considered in the study?\n11. What else was measured apart from sugar and fat levels?\n12. What condition did all patients in the study have?\n13. What was the average age of the patients in the study?\n14. How much did the ages of the patients vary in the study?\n15. What form and frequency of treatment did one group of patients receive?\n16. What test was conducted before the study began?\n17. How much glucose was used for the oral glucose tolerance test?\n18. What happened to the NEFA levels after 8 weeks?\n19. What happened to the sVCAM-1 levels after 8 weeks?\n20. What happened to the levels of sVCAM-1 after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment?\n21. To what extent did the sVCAM-1 levels decrease after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment?\n22. How did the levels of NEFA change after 120 minutes in liraglutide-treated patients compared to those treated with metformin?\n23. How did the difference in NEFA levels before and after liraglutide treatment compare to those before and after metformin treatment?\n24. Can you tell me the specific changes in AUCins observed before and after liraglutide treatment?\n25. What was the comparative effect of liraglutide and metformin treatments on insulin presence in the bloodstream, measured as AUCins?\n26. What were some of the specific measurements taken after the treatments?\n27. What happened to fasting NEFA levels after liraglutide treatment?\n28. How did fasting NEFA levels change after metformin treatment?\n29. What specific measurement was made after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment?\n30. What was measured after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment concerning sVCAM-1?\n31. Is there a relationship between the reduction of 120 min NEFA and the decrease of sVCAM-1?\n32. How strong is the positive correlation between the reduction of 120 min NEFA and the decrease of sVCAM-1?"}]}
