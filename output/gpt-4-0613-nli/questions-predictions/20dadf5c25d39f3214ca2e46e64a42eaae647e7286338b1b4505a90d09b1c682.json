The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. By how much did the VO2 max levels increase in the Ashwagandha group after 8 weeks?\n2. By how much did the VO2 max levels increase in the placebo group after 8 weeks?\n3. Was the difference in improvement between the Ashwagandha group and the placebo group statistically significant?\n4. What was the participation rate of women in this study? \n5. On what principles or theories were the Facebook postings based?\n6. What statistical method did the researchers use for analyzing the participant comments?\n7. What specific processes of the Transtheoretical Model were highlighted in the study results?\n8. Were there any specific techniques used in the posts for the group of people preparing to quit smoking?\n9. How effective were the posts aimed at raising consciousness about smoking and cessation?\n10. Where was this trial conducted?\n11. What surgical approaches were used in the CAS-TKA?\n12. What surgical approach was used in the less invasive group (MIS)?\n13. What surgical approach was used in the standard surgery group?\n14. From which centers or hospitals were the patients recruited for this study?\n15. What was the medical condition of the patients involved in this study?\n16. What was the distinguishing feature for the patients in the less invasive group (MIS)?\n17. Apart from pain, what other primary outcome was compared between the different surgical groups?\n18. Aside from pain and knee flexibility, was there any other test performed during the trial?\n19. Was there a measure taken about the strength of a specific muscle during the trial?\n20. Was knee pain also measured as a secondary outcome in the trial?\n21. Was there any specific scoring tool used in this trial to assess the knee condition?\n22. Was there another scoring system used apart from the Knee Society Score?\n23. What was the average pain score for the less invasive group (MIS) two weeks after surgery?\n24. And how about the standard surgery group? What was their average pain score two weeks after surgery?\n25. How significant was the difference in pain scores between the two groups two weeks post-surgery?\n26. Was there a significant difference in the duration of surgery for both groups?\n27. Was there any significant difference in the amount of blood lost between the two groups during surgery?\n28. What was the difference in the mean mechanical leg alignment between the two groups?\n29. What was the confidence interval for the difference in the mechanical leg alignment?\n30. Was the difference in mean mechanical leg alignment between the two groups statistically significant?\n31. In what parameters was the component alignment of the knee measured?\n32. Was there another parameter used to measure the component alignment of the knee?"}]}
