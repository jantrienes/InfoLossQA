The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. How would you describe the relationship between poor sleep and cognitive decline in this study?\n2. What is the significance of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in relation to heart disease?\n3. What is the role of good cholesterol or HDL in the prevention of heart disease?\n4. How was the experimental process of this study carried out?\n5. What effect did citrulline have on ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels in the immune cells used in the study?\n6. Did citrulline also impact the levels of another protein, ABCG1, in THP-1 immune cells?\n7. How much citrulline did the subjects in this study take each day?\n8. How did the researchers assess the effectiveness of citrulline on immune cells?\n9. Did the laboratory tests support the observations made in the human study about the effects of citrulline?\n10. What could be a potential benefit of citrulline based on the study's findings?\n11. Was the research executed recently in this scenario?\n12. How many young Boer goats were involved in the experiment?\n13. What breed are these Boer young goats?\n14. What is the gender of the goats involved in the study?\n15. Were the male goats in the study castrated?\n16. How old were the young goats at the start of the experiment?\n17. How much did the young goats weigh at the beginning of this study?\n18. How were the young goats assigned to their pens for this study?\n19. What were the different levels of substitution of soybean by sunflower cake in the goats' diets?\n20. What happened to the goats at the end of the experimental period?\n21. What was the average body weight of the goats at the time of slaughter?\n22. What was the hot carcass weight for the goats in the experiment?\n23. What was the cold carcass weight of the goats in the experiment?\n24. What was the hot carcass yield of the slaughtered goats on average?\n25. What is the recommendation about substituting soybean meal in goat's diet?\n26. Did the study on NicVAX\u00ae also aim to understand the connection between the vaccine dosage, how often it's given, and the body's immune response?\n27. Was the NicVAX\u00ae study set up in a way that neither the doctors nor the patients knew who was getting the real vaccine or a placebo?\n28. Was the NicVAX\u00ae trial conducted in just one location?\n29. Who had the most notable immune response to the NicVAX\u00ae in the trial?\n30. How successful were the trial participants who responded strongly to the NicVAX\u00ae in terms of quitting smoking?\n31. How significant were the results of NicVAX\u00ae trial?\n32. How confident can we be in the results of the NicVAX\u00ae study?"}]}
