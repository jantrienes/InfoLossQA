The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What type of trial is planned to be larger?\n2. How confident are researchers in the results they will get from the larger trial?\n3. Has the design for the larger trial been finalized yet?\n4. What phase was this trial in on the drug or device development process?\n5. How were patients distributed between the two treatments during the trial?\n6. What was the P-value of the comparison made between the Hickman and TIVAS groups?\n7. Did complications in the Hickman group lead to any devices being removed before they were supposed to be?\n8. What percentage of Hickman devices had to be removed early?\n9. Did any complications in the TIVAS group lead to devices being removed earlier than planned?\n10. What percentage of TIVAS devices needed to be removed early?\n11. How did the researchers measure the patients' quality of life?\n12. How many questions are on the device-specific questionnaire?\n13. How did the two groups compare in the device-specific quality of life questionnaire?\n14. What was the average cost per patient for the Hickman treatment?\n15. What was the range for the average cost per patient for the Hickman treatment?\n16. What was the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) value for the Hickman group?\n17. What was the confidence range for the quality-adjusted life years value for the Hickman group?\n18. How confident are the researchers in their results?\n19. Is the larger trial planned to be conducted in one centre or more?\n20. Which specific aspects of heart function were being studied?\n21. Did the patients in this study need any other treatments for their hearts?\n22. What was the exact heart condition the patients had?\n23. How many patients received the drugs?\n24. What was given to the other patients who didn't receive the drugs?\n25. Were there patients apart from the 35 who received the drug combination?\n26. At what dosage was the Levosimendan administered?\n27. Was Levosimendan given continuously throughout surgery?\n28. What was the dosage of sodium nitroprusside (SNP)?\n29. Were there any changes in blood pressure during the study?\n30. How many deaths occurred in the group that received the two drugs?\n31. In the group that received the drug combination, what was the average of the measurements taken?\n32. What caused the increase in the heart's ejection fraction (the percentage of blood leaving the heart each time it contracts)?"}]}
