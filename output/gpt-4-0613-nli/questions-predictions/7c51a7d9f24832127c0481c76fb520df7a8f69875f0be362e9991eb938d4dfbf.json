The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was recommended if the paracetamol didn't provide enough relief?\n2. How did the effectiveness of intra-articular morphine compare to that of intra-articular triamcinolone?\n3.

What two treatments were being compared in the study?\n6. From which perspective was this study conducted?\n7. Was the evaluation of the treatments part of a larger study?\n8. What indicates a positive score on the General Health Questionnaire used in this study?\n9. Were patients with a positive score on the General Health Questionnaire considered eligible for anything?\n10. What were the eligibility requirements for patients to participate in this study?\n11. How did the study measure improvement in the patients' mental health?\n12. Were there other metrics used to measure the outcome of the treatment in this study?\n13. How were the QALYs calculated?\n14. How reliable is the questionnaire used to measure resource use in this study?\n15. Was all the cost data available for this study?\n16. Was all the effect data available?\n17. How were the missing cost and effect data dealt with?\n18. What technique was used to deal with the missing data?\n19. How did the researchers analyze the costs and cost-effectiveness of the two treatment methods?\n20. What were the results in terms of any differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups?\n21. What were the average total costs for the group receiving Problem-Solving Treatment?\n22. What were the average total costs for the group receiving usual care?\n23. What was the 95% confidence interval for the difference in costs between the two treatments?\n24. What were the two methods compared in the analysis?\n25. Which treatment method was found to be more cost-effective?\n26. Were any additional types of analysis done on the data from this study?\n27. Did the sensitivity analyses align with the primary findings of the study?\n28. In terms of cost-effectiveness, how do PST and UC compare?\n29. Why was there a difference in the total costs between the PST and UC groups?\n30. What led to the high costs associated with the three outliers?\n31. In which group were these three outliers that had extremely high costs?\n32. How common is labor induction in obstetrics?"}]}
