The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. How much weight, on average, did the infants in the SA group lose while they were in the hospital?\n2. Was there a significant difference in weight loss between the two groups of newborns?\n3. How significant was the difference in weight loss between the two groups?\n4. What was the age group of the patients involved in the study?\n5. What type of hospital was the study conducted in? \n6. How were the patients divided into groups?\n7. Was this study conducted retrospectively or prospectively?\n8. What method was used to collect information from the patients after the surgery?\n9. How were the responses to the questionnaire measured?\n10. What was the average score of the consent index for Group B?\n11. What was the standard deviation of the consent index score for group B?\n12. What was the p-value in the study?\n13. Why is the result of the study considered statistically significant?\n14. What was the p-value related to the impact of the separate consent form on patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of anesthesia procedures?\n15. What was the impact of the separate written consent on patients' satisfaction regarding information about common side effects?\n16. What was the p-value related to the impact of the extra form on patients' satisfaction with the information about common side effects of anesthesia?\n17. How did the separate written consent affect patients' understanding of rare but serious complications?\n18. What was the p-value related to the impact of the extra form on patients' understanding of rare but serious complications?\n19. What type of information did the improved informed consent process provide better details about?\n20. Is there any discussion surrounding the use of stents in kidney transplant surgery?\n21. Are there any complications associated with the use of stents in the urinary tract? \n22. Besides encrustation, are there any other complications that could occur with a stent in the urinary tract?\n23. Can stent crustation cause any severe complications?\n24. What are the potential complications with the procedure to remove the stents, also known as cystoscopy?\n25. What implications does cystoscopy for stent extraction have, financial or otherwise?\n26. How was the selection process of patients for the two different stent methods done? \n27. Can you explain more about the patient group where the stent was attached to a catheter?\n28. What was the rate of urinary tract infections in the study group by the fourth week post-surgery? \n29. What was the overall reported rate of urinary leakage across both patient groups? \n30. Was stent crustation observed in patients where the stent was used in the conventional way, separate from the catheter?\n31. What do the results suggest about the effectiveness of the new technique of attaching the stent to the catheter?\n32. Overall, how would you rate the performance of the new stenting technique used in this study?"}]}
