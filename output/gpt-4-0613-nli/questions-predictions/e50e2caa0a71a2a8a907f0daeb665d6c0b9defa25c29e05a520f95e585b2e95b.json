The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the regression coefficient, a statistical measurement, recorded in the study?\n2. What was the range for the 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficient in this study?\n3. Was there any difference in the triglyceride levels of the isomaltulose group compared to the sucrose group after 12 weeks?\n4. Did the research involve evaluating other parameters, apart from HbA1c and triglycerides?\n5. Under what conditions was the assessment conducted?\n6. What specific type and dose of insulin was used in this study?\n7. What was the specific condition of all the patients in the study?\n8. Was platelet activation assessed with or without stimulation in the study?\n9. Apart from without stimulation, was there any other way platelet activation was assessed in this study?\n10. What substance was used for stimulation in the platelet activation assessment?\n11. Besides U46619, was there any other substance used for stimulation in the platelet activation assessment?\n12. To what specific range was the premeal blood glucose standardized?\n13. When besides before and after the pre-meal blood glucose standardization were measurements taken in the study?\n14. By how much did premeal insulin reduce post-meal high blood sugar levels compared to the placebo?\n15. How did the placebo affect post-meal insulin levels?\n16. What was administered after the placebo in the study?\n17. What impact did the standardized meal have on U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression?\n18. By how much did the placebo enhance U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression?\n19. How much did premeal insulin increase the response of platelet P-selectin expression compared to the placebo?\n20. What was the effect of placebo on fibrinogen binding after meal intake?\n21. What was the effect of premeal insulin on fibrinogen binding after meal intake?\n22. By how much did premeal insulin increase U46619-induced fibrinogen binding after meal intake?\n23. Are there any international guidelines that recommend the use of fluids during surgery?\n24. What are the specific post-operation symptoms that the use of these fluids during surgery is aimed at alleviating?\n25. Does there exist an ideal plan or practice for the administration of fluids during surgery?\n26. Is the optimal plan for fluid administration during surgery already defined or established?\n27. Was this study planned to track participants forward in time from that point onwards?\n28. Did this research include any measures to prevent bias, such as blinding?\n29. What specific type of colloid fluid was used during this study?\n30. Was this study conducted on patients with health issues or on healthy individuals?\n31. What specific type of surgery were the volunteers in the study undergoing?\n32. How many patients in the study were given the colloid fluid?"}]}
