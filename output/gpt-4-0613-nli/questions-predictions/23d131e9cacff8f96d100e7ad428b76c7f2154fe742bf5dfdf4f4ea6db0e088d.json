The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Besides sepsis, what other complications of critical illness can lead to muscle loss?\n2. What types of patients did the original studies focus on?\n3. Apart from COPD, what other disease conditions were focused on in the study?\n4. What is the condition of the muscles in the patients studied?\n5. What diagnostic tool was used in the study to measure muscle mass?\n6. How was muscle mass evaluated in the study?\n7. What specific muscles were observed in the study?\n8. What part of the body do the vastus intermedius and the rectus femoris belong to?\n9. Was there any change in the muscle measurements in both treatment groups?\n10. What was the change in muscle size in the group that received electrical muscle stimulation?\n11. Was the change in muscle size significant in the group that received electrical muscle stimulation?\n12. What was the change in muscle size in the control group that did not receive electrical muscle stimulation?\n13. Was the change in muscle size significant in the control group that didn't receive EMS?\n14. What more can you tell me about the change in muscle size in the group treated with electrical muscle stimulation?\n15. Was this additional decrease in muscle size significant in the group treated with electrical muscle stimulation?\n16. What more can you tell me about the change in muscle size in the control group?\n17. Was this additional decrease in muscle size significant in the control group that didn't receive EMS treatment?\n18. Did the size of all thigh muscles decrease in the group that received electrical muscle stimulation?\n19. How much did the size of the right rectus femoris decrease in the group that received electrical muscle stimulation?\n20. What was the percentage decrease in the muscle size of the right rectus femoris in the group that received electrical muscle stimulation?\n21. Did the size of the right rectus femoris also decrease in the control group?\n22. How much did the size of the right rectus femoris decrease in the control group?\n23. What was the percentage decrease in the muscle size of the right rectus femoris in the control group?\n24. Which group had a smaller decrease in the muscle size of the right rectus femoris - the group that received electrical muscle stimulation or the control group?\n25. Does Afghanistan have any national guidelines for treating diseases?\n26. Which specific treatment does Afghanistan's national guidelines recommend the use of chloroquine for?\n27. What kind of infection is the drug chloroquine used to treat, according to Afghanistan's national guidelines?\n28. Which type of malaria infection is most common in Afghanistan?\n29. Where is the resistance to the malaria drug chloroquine emerging?\n30. Was the trial testing the malaria treatments open-label or blind?\n31. Was the assignment of patients to different treatment groups in the trial randomized?\n32. Was there a control group used in the study testing malaria treatments?"}]}
