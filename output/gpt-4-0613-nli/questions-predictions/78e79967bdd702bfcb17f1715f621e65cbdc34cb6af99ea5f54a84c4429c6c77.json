The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Were there any clinically relevant improvements in Motor Skills detected in the study?\n2. What was the identifier given to this study in the German register of clinical trials?\n3. When was the study approved by the Ethics Committee of Lower Austria? \n4. Who designed and implemented the two health worker in-service training approaches that were used in the study?\n5. What is the nature of the first approach to training that was used in the study?\n6. Does the Integrated Management of Infectious Diseases (IMID) course include any distance learning aspects?\n7. What is the On-Site Support (OSS) that was mentioned?\n8. What aspects of healthcare delivery did the study assess for the effect of On-Site Support (OSS)? \n9. Besides workload and facility performance, what other area was included in the test of the On-Site Support (OSS)?\n10. Who were the participants in one of the subgroups in the study?\n11. How many mid-level practitioners (MLP) in each group went through the special classroom training?\n12. Did health care providers at all study sites receive On-Site Support (OSS) visits?\n13. How frequently did the On-Site Support (OSS) visits to Arm A facilities occur?\n14. When did the on-site support visits happen for the care providers at Arm A facilities?\n15. How many On-Site Support (OSS) visits were made in total to Arm A facilities?\n16. Did the care providers at Arm B facilities receive on-site support visits during the same time period as Arm A?\n17. Over what time period did the outpatient visits evaluated in the study occur?\n18. How many outpatient visits were there in total from November 2009 to December 2010?\n19. How many outpatient visits were analyzed in the study?\n20. What percentage of the total visits does the analyzed outpatient visits represent?\n21. Who were some of the health workers providing treatment during the study?\n22. How many mid-level practitioners who undertook the course provided treatment during the study?\n23. Besides the mid-level practitioners who undertook the Integrated Management of Infectious Diseases (IMID) training, who else provided treatment?\n24. How many health workers who did not receive the Integrated Management of Infectious Diseases (IMID) training, provided treatment in the study?\n25. Did the process of measurement take into account any other contributing factors?\n26. Was there a significant effect of On-Site Support (OSS) on the workload (patients-per-provider-per-day) of both the MLPs trained in IMID and those who weren't?\n27. For the mid-level practitioners who went through the special training, were there any areas where the OSS was found to be effective?\n28. For the health workers who hadn't been through the special classroom training, were there any areas where the OSS was found to be effective?\n29. Was there any significant effect of OSS on the workload of the health workers according to the study?\n30. Were there any significant effects of On-Site Support (OSS) on the performance of the facilities?\n31. Are the effects of On-Site Support (OSS) on facilities' performance the same across different participant subgroups?\n32. What is the identifier for the article that talks about this study?"}]}
