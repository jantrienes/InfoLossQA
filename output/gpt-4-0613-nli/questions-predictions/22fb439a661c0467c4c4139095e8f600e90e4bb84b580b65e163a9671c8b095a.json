The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What types of solutions were the COCs exposed to?\n2. What special type of protectants do the VS1 and VS2 solutions contain?\n3. What are the names of the permeating cryoprotectants found in the VS1 and VS2 solutions?\n4. Besides the cryoprotectants, did the COCs receive any other types of treatment?\n5. Did the amount of time the COCs spent in the warming solution have any negative effects on their growth and development?\n6. Did the cryoprotectants used, EG and DMSO, have any negative effects on the COCs?\n7. Were specific genetic variants examined in the study, and if so, which ones?\n8. How many adults were part of the genotyping process in this study?\n9. What was the average age of the adults in the study?\n10. What was the average Body Mass Index (or BMI, a measure of body fat based on height and weight) of the adults in this study?\n11. How many individuals were part of the high-fat diet group in this study?\n12. How many people were part of the low-fat diet group in this study?\n13. What specific genetic type was considered in this study?\n14. Which other genetic variant was tested in addition to rs1522813 in this study?\n15. Did people with a certain genetic type see a higher decrease in MetS conditions with the high-fat diet?\n16. How much more likely were the rs1522813 A-allele carriers to see a decrease of MetS on the high-fat diet?\n17. What was the range of this odds ratio for those who do not carry the A-allele of rs1522813?\n18. Where is the rs1522813 variant located?\n19. What type of pain relief is commonly used after minor knee surgery?\n20. How were the medications, morphine and tramadol, administered in this study?\n21. What type of surgery were the study's participants undergoing?\n22. Was this study single-masked or double-masked?\n23. What kind of surgery did the patients in the study undergo?\n24. What was the dosage of morphine given to one group of patients?\n25. How much tramadol was given to the other group of patients in this study?\n26. How were the drugs administered to the patients in the study?\n27. How was the patients' pain level evaluated in the study?\n28. What method was used to compare the effectiveness of the two painkillers?\n29. Was there a significant difference in the VRS scores between the two groups of patients before surgery?\n30. Did patients who received tramadol experience significantly less pain one hour after surgery compared to those who received morphine?\n31. Did the pain level decrease for the patients who were prescribed tramadol after their surgery?\n32. How was the decrease in VRS scores evaluated in the study?"}]}
