The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What kind of biological processes is creatine involved in?\n2. What part of the body is most affected by the energy metabolism process that creatine is involved in?\n3. What affects the process of post-activation potentiation (PAP)?\n4. Besides muscle strength, what else was examined in the study?\n5. When was the optimal individual post-activation potentiation (PAP) time examined during the study?\n6. What specific exercise was used in the study to test the athletes' maximum strength?\n7. What was the purpose of the tests during the study?\n8. What other aspects of athletic performance did the tests aim to measure?\n9. What substance was used as a placebo in this study?\n10. What effect did the creatine have on the strength of the athletes?\n11. How substantial was the increase in the athletes' strength after taking creatine?\n12. How did the researchers determine that the increase in strength in the creatine group was significant?\n13. What was the p-value of the increase in strength in the creatine group?\n14. Did the creatine group show any changes in post-activation potentiation (PAP) time?\n15. Were the differences in the optimal individual post-activation potentiation (PAP) time between the creatine and placebo group significant?\n16. What does the study show about the effects of creatine supplementation on muscle strength?\n17. What else does the study show about the effects of creatine supplementation, apart from muscle strength?\n18. Besides treating inflammation and scarring, what other positive effects did Andrographis paniculata have in animal experiments?\n19. What was another aspect of the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients' condition that the researchers examined in their study on A. paniculata?\n20. How did the researchers measure the fatigue levels of the MS patients?\n21. How did they measure the disability of the MS patients in the study?\n22. Did the researchers use any other methods to examine the state of the MS patients, other than testing for fatigue and disability?\n23. How was the fatigue of the MS patients who took A. paniculata affected?\n24. How does the effectiveness of A. paniculata compare to a placebo in reducing fatigue in MS patients?\n25. Is A. paniculata alone more effective at reducing fatigue in MS patients than the standard interferon beta treatment?\n26. Do emergency departments often carry out painful procedures for diagnosis and treatment?\n27. Is it important for emergency doctors to know how to carry out procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA)?\n28. Who usually carries out procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in the emergency department?\n29. What specific condition was the study focusing on treating?\n30. What was the main goal of the treatment mentioned in the study?\n31. What kind of study was carried out?\n32. What was the condition of the patients included in the trial?"}]}
