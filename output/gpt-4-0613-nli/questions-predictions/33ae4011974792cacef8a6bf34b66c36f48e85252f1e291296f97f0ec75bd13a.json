The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the specific medical condition the researchers were looking at when trying to understand Maraviroc's effects?\n2. What was the major measurement the researchers focused on in this study?\n3. Was the study blind or open-label?\n4. What did the control period of the study entail in terms of the patients' treatment?\n5. Did the researchers monitor anything related to how HIV enters cells?\n6. Did the researchers measure anything related to blood clotting over the course of the study?\n7. Did the researchers check for any indicators of immune system activity?\n8. What type of statistical methods did the researchers use for the analysis?\n9. What specific relation were the researchers studying?\n10. What statistical method did the researchers use to study the relationship between different variables?\n11. What is the HIV condition of the patient in the study?\n12. By how much did the blood vessel function (FMD) improve after the extra Maraviroc was added?\n13. What was the variation in FMD improvement after Maraviroc intensification?\n14. How did the blood vessel function change in the control period, when patients were not given extra Maraviroc?\n15. What was the variation in FMD decrease during the control stage of the study?\n16. Was the difference in blood vessel function between the Maraviroc intensification and control periods significant?\n17. Was there any relationship found between changes in blood vessel health and inflammation?\n18. What was the exact value of the relationship between changes in blood vessel function and inflammation?\n19. What was the range in which we can be 95% certain that the true value of the relationship between changes in blood vessel function and inflammation lies?\n20. How confident can we be that the relationship between changes in blood vessel health and inflammation is not due to chance?\n21. Did the study find any relationship between changes in blood vessel function and changes in some immune response cells?\n22. What was the numerical relationship between changes in blood vessel health and changes in these immune cells?\n23. What range did the researchers decide was likely to contain the true value of the relationship between changes in blood vessel function and immune cells?\n24. How confident were the researchers that the relationship between blood vessel health and immune cells is not due to chance?\n25. Did the researchers control for any other factors when studying these relationships?\n26. How is Maraviroc used in treating HIV patients?\n27. Does the additional Maraviroc affect anything related to the lining of the blood vessels?\n28. Is there a unique identifier for the online version of this article?\n29. What other changes, beyond diet, does the hypothesis suggest individuals might make if they are aware of their genetic risks?\n30. What type of dietary and lifestyle changes are implied by the hypothesis and results of the study?\n31. Where did the data for this study come from?\n32. What type of trial was conducted for this study?"}]}
