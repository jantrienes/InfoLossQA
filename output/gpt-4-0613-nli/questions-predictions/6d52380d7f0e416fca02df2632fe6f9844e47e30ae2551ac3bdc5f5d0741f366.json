The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the average level of growth hormone found in patients treated with lanreotide microparticles?\n2. What was the standard error for the growth hormone level measurements in patients treated with lanreotide microparticles?\n3. Was there a significant difference in the growth hormone levels between lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and lanreotide microparticles treatments?\n4. What percentage of patients had growth hormone levels less than 2.5 ng/ml?\n5. Is it a mistake that both 54% and 46% of patients had growth hormone levels less than 2.5 ng/ml?\n6. What percentage of patients on lanreotide Autogel\u00ae had both growth hormone (GH) levels less than 2.5 ng/ml and normalized insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels?\n7. What percentage of patients on lanreotide microparticles had both lower than 2.5 ng/ml growth hormone levels and normalized insulin-like growth factor-1 levels?\n8. How often are lanreotide microparticles usually administered to patients?\n9. Do a lot of people with type 2 diabetes also struggle with depression?\n10. What was the daily dose of paroxetine that the group was given in the study?\n11. What were the main measures used to see if the treatment was effective?\n12. Aside from glycemic control, what else was used as a main measure to determine the efficacy of the treatment?\n13. What kind of test was used to measure the participant's glycemic control?\n14. How did the researchers measure the participants' quality of life in the study?\n15. Were any scoring instruments used by clinicians in the study?\n16. What was one of the scoring instruments that the clinicians used?\n17. What was the second scoring instrument that the clinicians used?\n18. Did the patients in the study also use any scoring instruments to rate their own symptoms?\n19. What was the scoring instrument that the patients used?\n20. How significant were the results showing that the paroxetine group had slightly better blood sugar control?\n21. Were there any changes observed in sex-hormone-binding-globuline (SHBG) levels in the study?\n22. Did the group taking paroxetine or the placebo have a greater increase in SHBG levels?\n23. How statistically significant was the increased level of SHBG in the group taking paroxetine?\n24. What does an increase in SHBG levels mean in relation to insulin sensitivity?\n25. Was paroxetine or the placebo found to be more effective in the study?\n26. Did any of the trends observed in the study support the idea that paroxetine has a beneficial impact on depression and diabetes?\n27. What other trend was observed in relation to the paroxetine group?\n28. Which group had a greater decrease in their serum cortisol levels, the paroxetine or the placebo group?\n29. How significant were the results showing a decrease in cortisol levels in the paroxetine group?\n30. What are the standard health guidelines that dictate when patients should start taking antidepressants?\n31. What type of drugs are the people in this study trying to stop using?\n32. Where do these drug users go to ask for help with stopping their drug use?"}]}
