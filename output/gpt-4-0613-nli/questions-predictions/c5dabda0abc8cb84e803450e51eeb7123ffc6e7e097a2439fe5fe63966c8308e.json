The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What are the minimum and maximum success rates we can expect with a 95% certainty?\n2. How much improvement was considered as significant in the study?\n3. On average, how many complications or adverse events did patients in the surgery group experience?\n4. Can you explain again what was causing the sacroiliac joint problems in the patients of the study?\n5. Can sacroiliac joint dysfunction become chronic because of degenerative sacroiliitis?\n6. Can sacroiliac joint dysfunction also become chronic because of sacroiliac joint disruptions?\n7. What type of patients were considered for the less-invasive surgery in the study?\n8. Aside from reducing pain, was another goal of the study to see if the exercises could increase patients' overall physical abilities?\n9. Did all volunteers give their permission in writing before participating in the study?\n10. Did the researchers use a variety of tools to assess how well the patients were doing?\n11. Was a test called the \"Lequesne's Algofunctional Questionnaire\" used in the study?\n12. Was the \"Oswestry Disability Index\" test used in the evaluations?\n13. Did they use a technique known as goniometry as one of their testing methods?\n14. Did the researchers use a device called a load cell to measure muscle strength?\n15. What type of therapy did the non-water exercise group receive?\n16. What was the average age of the group that did water exercises?\n17. How old were the youngest and oldest volunteers in the water exercise group?\n18. What was the average age of the group that did non-water exercises?\n19. How old were the youngest and oldest volunteers in the non-water exercise group?\n20. Were there significant differences between the two groups in terms of their flexibility or movement in certain areas after the 12 weeks?\n21. Is physical therapy an effective treatment for muscle and joint problems in patients with sickle cell disease?\n22. Do we need to include more people in future studies to get clearer results?\n23. Do we need to extend the treatment period in future studies to get clearer results?\n24. What specific type of sleep did the earplugs and eye masks help improve?\n25. In which type of environment was this study conducted?\n26. For how long were the patients expected to stay in the ICU following their surgery?\n27. In which specific type of ICU did the surgeries of the patients take place?\n28. Did the study involve the use of earplugs for sleep?\n29. Were eye masks used in this study for sleep?\n30. When did this study take place within the patients' treatment timeline?\n31. What hormone levels, related to sleep, were analyzed in this study?\n32. Was any other hormone, besides melatonin, analyzed in this research?"}]}
