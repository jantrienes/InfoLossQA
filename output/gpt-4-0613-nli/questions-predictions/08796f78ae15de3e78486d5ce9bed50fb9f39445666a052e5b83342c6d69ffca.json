The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What percentage of people still had the 23S rRNA gene three years after triple therapy?\n2. What percentage of people in the OAC group who tested positive for the 23S rRNA gene also had the A2143G mutation?\n3. How many individuals in the OAC group had the A2143G mutation?\n4. What percentage of 23S rRNA-positive subjects in the OA group had the A2143G mutation?\n5. How many individuals in the OA group had the A2143G mutation?\n6. What percentage of the 23S rRNA-positive subjects in the placebo group had the A2143G mutation?\n7. How many individuals in the placebo group tested positive for the 23S rRNA gene?\n8. How many individuals in the placebo group had the A2143G mutation?\n9. What is the basic prevalence of the A2143G mutation among the tested subjects?\n10. In which population was this prevalence rate of A2143G mutation studied?\n11. Is Artesunate+amodiaquine (AS+AQ) a suggested initial treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Africa?\n12. Is Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) also recommended for the initial treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Africa?\n13. What are the most commonly suggested treatments for uncomplicated malaria in Africa?\n14. Apart from AS+AQ and AL, is there another potential treatment for uncomplicated malaria?\n15. How are the drug treatment policies for uncomplicated malaria developed?\n16. What is the health condition of the children involved in the study?\n17. How were the children divided into groups for the study?\n18. Where were the children followed up after they received the medication?\n19. On which days was follow-up done on the children after they received the medication?\n20. What type of analysis was conducted for the study?\n21. What exactly was measured during the analysis in the study?\n22. What was the corrected PCF28 for re-infections in the group that received Artesunate+amodiaquine (AS+AQ)?\n23. How about the AL group, what was their corrected PCF28 for re-infections?\n24. What was the corrected PCF28 for re-infections for the group that received the alternative treatment of AS+CD?\n25. What was the statistical significance (p-value) of the comparison of corrected PCF28 between the three groups?\n26. What was the uncorrected PCF28, or treatment failure rate excluding re-infections, for the group that received AS+AQ?\n27. What was the uncorrected PCF28 for the group that received AL?\n28. How was the early treatment failure rate in all the groups?\n29. What was the specific rate of early treatment failure for the group treated with AS+AQ?\n30. How about the AL group, what was their rate for early treatment failure?\n31. What was the rate of early treatment failure for the group treated with AS+CD?\n32. What was the main reason for the high rate of early treatment failure among the participants?"}]}
