The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. How was the Salbutamol medication administered to the patients?\n2.  Was the use of Salbutamol allowed during the conduct of the study?\n3. How was the change in the patients' breathing ability measured?\n4. Was the change related to any specific lung function test?\n5. How long after the dosage was given was the FEV1 measured?\n6. How many patients in the study received the 4.5 \u03bcg dose of Formoterol?\n7. How many patients in the study received the 9 \u03bcg dose of Formoterol?\n8. How many patients received a placebo instead of the actual drug in the study?\n9. What type of study was this research?\n10. Was the research performed in a specific way, perhaps with assignments given out without any order?\n11. How many standard bone marrow tests were performed in the study?\n12. And how many tests used the new OnControl device?\n13. How many doctors-in-training performed the bone marrow tests?\n14. How many fully qualified doctors oversaw the study?\n15. Who figured out the average length of the bone marrow samples?\n16. Did the pathologist know which method was used for each sample?\n17. What was the average length of the samples taken out by the OnControl device?\n18. What was the average length of the samples taken out by the regular needle?\n19. Can we confidently say that the OnControl device led to longer samples?\n20. How sure can we be that the difference in sample lengths is not due to random chance?\n21. Besides sample size, what other result did the researchers measure?\n22. How long did the procedures take on average when using the OnControl device?\n23. How long did the procedures take on average when using the regular needle?\n24. Is the time difference between the two methods statistically significant?\n25. Besides sample length and procedure time, were there other factors that the researchers considered?\n26. Which method does the study suggest as the new standard for bone marrow tests?\n27. What was the health condition of all the participants in the study?\n28. What types of sugar were used in the sweet foods given to the participants?\n29. How much isomaltulose or sucrose were the participants consuming per day through sweet foods?\n30. Were the participants in a controlled environment or living freely during the study?\n31. What was the blood sugar level measurement, or HbA1c level, for the participants who consumed sucrose?\n32. What was the measured blood sugar level, or HbA1c level, for the participants who consumed isomaltulose?"}]}
