The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.

Does the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer have a group dedicated to lung cancer?\n15. What was the specific volume and concentration of the saline solution used in the tests?\n16. Besides saline, was there any other type of solution used in the experiments? If so, what was the volume and concentration?\n17. What was the exact dose of quinine administered to the volunteers?\n18. Was there a gender predominance among the volunteers involved in the study? \n19. How many experimental examinations or \"explorations\" were performed during the study?\n20. Was there a predetermined sequence or order for the fourth exploration during the study?\n21. How was the sequence or order of the fourth exploration determined?\n22.

Was the change in average blood sugar levels with and without quinine, when using saline solution, significant?\n24. What was the average blood sugar level during the 4-hour period when the volunteers were given glucose solution but not quinine?\n25. Was the change in average blood sugar levels with and without quinine, when using glucose solution, significant?\n26. How significant was the decrease in blood sugar levels, statistically speaking?\n27. What was the lowest recorded blood glucose level during these tests?\n28. How statistically significant was the nadir value reached in the blood sugar levels?\n29. How big are the nanoparticles mentioned in this study?\n30.
