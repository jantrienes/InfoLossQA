The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Which scores were used in the motor assessments during this study?\n2. Which physical aspects were evaluated using the UPDRS scores during this study?\n3. Was the improvement in UPDRS scores with aDBS statistically significant?\n4. How was the effect size of aDBS on UPDRS scores measured?\n5. Did the use of the Parkinson's disease medication, Levodopa, have any effect on the Time on Stimulation (ToS)?\n6. How did the reductions in Time on Stimulation (ToS) compare to previous levels when patients were administered Levodopa?\n7. Can bilateral aDBS improve symptoms related to balance and posture, known as axial symptoms, in Parkinson's patients?\n8. Can bilateral aDBS have any beneficial effects on the limb symptoms in Parkinson's patients?\n9. Why do we need more data on the effectiveness of the Health Promoting Schools program?\n10. What kind of a trial was implemented to test the Health Promoting Schools program? \n11. When were the Year 3 primary school classes recruited for the study?\n12. Were the classes involved in the study exposed to any similar health program recently?\n13. How were the classes distributed in terms of participation in the program?\n14. How long was the training that the teachers received?\n15. Apart from on-the-job training, what other training did the teachers receive?\n16. How long did the additional workshops for the teachers last?\n17. Did the Health Promoting Schools program have any other goals aside from promoting health behavior in students?\n18. What were other categories they checked, apart from feelings and social activities in school, physical activity, well-being, and physical skills?\n19. What were other categories measured apart from feelings and social activities at school, physical activity, well-being, and concentration?\n20. How did the study measure \"emotional and social experience at school\"?\n21. How did the study measure \"physical activity\"?\n22. Did the study involve a final measurement or assessment?\n23. Did the people evaluating the data know which class participated in the study and which did not?\n24. What technique was used to ensure that assessors aren't biased in their evaluations?\n25. What kind of analysis was used in the study to investigate the program's effectiveness?\n26. Were attention and concentration also evaluated as a part of the study?\n27. How were the differences in categories between two groups estimated statistically?\n28. Was there any category where the intervention group exhibited significant differences?\n29. What specific abilities were considered under the \"Motor Skills\" category?\n30. Between the group using the program and the group waiting to begin, which showed better motor skills?\n31. How significant were the differences in Motor Skills scores between the intervention group and control group?\n32. What were the findings of the study in terms of Motor Skills?"}]}
