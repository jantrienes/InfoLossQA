The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.

What was the average number of follow-up visits for the group that received their check-ups in a community setting with a navigator (G1)?\n9. What was the standard deviation for the number of follow-up visits for the group that received their check-ups in a community setting with a navigator (G1)?\n10. What was the average number of follow-up visits for the group that received their check-ups in an office setting with a navigator (G2)?\n11. What was the standard deviation in the number of follow-up visits in the group who got office-based care with a patient navigator (G2)?\n12. What was the average number of follow-up visits for the group that received their check-ups in an office setting without a navigator (G3)?\n13. What was the range of follow-up visits in the group who got office-based care without a patient navigator (G3)?\n14. What was the P-value when comparing the number of follow-up visits among the three different groups?\n15. What percentage of patients in the group who got community-based care with a patient navigator (G1) attended their follow-up appointments?\n16. How many patients in the group who got community-based care with a patient navigator (G1) went to their follow-up appointments?\n17. How many patients were in the group that got community-based care with a patient navigator (G1)?\n18. What was the adherence rate to follow-up appointments for the group that received office-based care with a patient navigator (G2)?\n19.

How many participants were there in the group that received office-based care with a patient navigator (G2)?\n21. What percentage of patients in the group who received office-based care without a patient navigator (G3) attended their follow-up appointments?\n22. How many patients in the group that got their check-ups in an office setting without a navigator (G3) followed through with their appointments?\n23. What was the rate of attendance for two or more follow-up visits among the group that received community-based care with a patient navigator (G1)?\n24. How many patients in G1 who had at least two appointments kept their appointments?\n25. What was the rate of appointment adherence for those patients in G2 who had at least two follow-up visits?\n26. How many patients in G2 who had at least two appointments kept their appointments?\n27. What was the percentage of patients in the group who received office-based care without a patient navigator (G3) that attended at least two follow-up visits?\n28. How many patients in the group that received office-based care without a patient navigator (G3) had at least two appointments and attended them?\n29. What was the P-value when comparing the adherence rates among the different groups?\n30. Can you tell me more about how Maraviroc works?\n31. Does Maraviroc have any effect on the cells involved in immune response?\n32. Overall, where was the decrease in immune activation and monocyte presence observed in this study?"}]}
