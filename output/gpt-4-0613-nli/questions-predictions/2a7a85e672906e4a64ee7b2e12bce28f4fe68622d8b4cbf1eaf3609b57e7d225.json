The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Were there any significant differences in how long patients lived between the two treatment groups?\n2. Were there any significant differences in the median time it took for the cancer to spread between the two treatment groups?\n3. Which group had a lower rate of tumor progression or cancer spread?\n4. Why didn't the lower rate of tumor spread in the SIRT group lead to a better outcome?\n5. What is special about this study comparing SIRT and TACE treatments for liver cancer?\n6. What type of study design was used to compare the SIRT and TACE treatments for liver cancer?\n7. What types of liver cancer were the treatments SIRT and TACE being compared for in this study?\n8. What can the results of this study be used for in future research?\n9. How was the rosehip extract discovered as a potential treatment for obesity?\n10. What were the results of previous investigations with rosehip extract on mice?\n11. What was the health status of the participants in the study?\n12.  Where was the rosehip extract study conducted? \n13. What type of study was conducted to assess the effects of rosehip extract on obesity?\n14. What was the minimum body mass index of the study participants?\n15. What was the maximum body mass index of the study participants?\n16. How were the participants grouped for the study?\n17. What were the primary outcomes that the study focused on?\n18. How was the change in body fat percentage considered in the study?\n19. How did the body fat percentages of participants compare before and after the use of the rosehip extract?\n20. Is sacroiliac joint pain a common condition?\n21. Is sacroiliac joint pain usually diagnosed correctly or is it often missed?\n22. Have there been any other studies that have compared both surgical and non-surgical treatments for sacroiliac joint problems at the same time?\n23. Did all of the patients in the study have problems with their sacroiliac joint?\n24. What specifically was causing the sacroiliac joint problems in the patients?\n25. Can you explain in more detail the specific treatments the patients were assigned?\n26. How many patients were assigned to the minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery?\n27. Did the study collect information on the patient's initial levels of sacroiliac joint pain before their treatments began?\n28. What information, other than pain scores, was collected before the patients began their treatment?\n29. At the start of the study, were the patients in good or poor health?\n30. What was the average initial level of pain, according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), experienced by the patients in the study?\n31. What was the average initial Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of the patients in the study?\n32. How many of the patients were able to be followed-up with after their treatments?"}]}
