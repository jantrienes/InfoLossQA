The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the average time for measurements after the infusion was stopped?\n2. What change was observed in the plasma PC EPA levels in the treatment group?\n3. How did the plasma PC DHA levels change in the treatment group?\n4. What change was observed in the erythrocyte linoleic acid levels in the treatment group?\n5. How did the erythrocyte EPA levels change in the treatment group?\n6. What happened to the plasma PC levels after the 5-12 day washout period?\n7. What happened to the erythrocyte EPA and linoleic acid levels after the 5-12 day washout period?\n8. What happened to the Plasma PC DHA levels after the washout period?\n9. Are there any criticisms of spinal anesthesia commonly known?\n10. Are there other medicines given alongside the local anesthetic in spinal anesthesia procedures?\n11. Was the study looking forward at future results or examining past data?\n12. In this study, did both the patients and the researchers know who received which treatment?\n13. Was the study design open label? \n14. What was the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status of the patients in the study?\n15. What type of surgery were the patients in the study scheduled for?\n16. What was given to patients in the first group along with the normal anesthetic?\n17. Where was the treatment for the first group administered?\n18. What was the anesthetic used for the second group of patients?\n19. In addition to the anesthetic, what else was given to the patients in the second group?\n20. What was the exact dosage of midazolam given to patients in the second group?\n21. How long does the pain relief typically last when only the regular anesthetic is used? \n22. How does the use of midazolam affect numbness in the patient?\n23. How long does the numbness last when only the regular anesthesia is used?\n24. What stage of non-small cell lung cancer did all the patients in the study have?\n25. Did the patients receive any treatment after the surgery?\n26. What was the average survival duration for the patients who received chemotherapy before surgery?\n27. Was the difference in average survival times between the group that received chemotherapy before surgery and the surgery-first group statistically significant?\n28. Was the survival difference for patients with Stage II non-small cell lung cancer significant?\n29. What was the hazard ratio for patients with Stage I non-small cell lung cancer?\n30. Was the hazard ratio for Stage I patients statistically significant?\n31. Was the difference in survival rates between those who seemed to get better after preoperative chemotherapy and the others statistically significant?\n32. Who conducted the initial pooled analysis of the 19 studies mentioned in the introduction?"}]}
