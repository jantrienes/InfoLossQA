The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the impact of the intervention on the two groups?\n2. How much did the medication appropriateness index (MAI) score change for the group that received medication therapy management?\n3. What aspect did the group with extra support show significant improvement?\n4. How much did the medication appropriateness index (MAI) score change for the group that received usual care?\n5. What was the significance level of the difference in medication appropriateness index (MAI) scores between the two groups?\n6. Other than the medication appropriateness index, where else did the intervention group show improvement?\n7. How much did anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores change for the group that received medication therapy management?\n8. How much did anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores change for the group that received usual care?\n9. How promising were the results of using medication therapy management intervention?\n10. What is the ultimate goal when managing medications for older adults?\n11. Do you know the registration number of the clinical trial?\n12. When was the study registered?\n13. Is there a digital identifier for the online version of this study's article?\n14. Who can access the supplementary material of the study?\n15. What type of study was conducted to test the combination of cyclophosphamide and personalized peptide vaccination?\n16. How much cyclophosphamide was administered to the patients and for how long?\n17. How many peptides were selected for the personalized peptide vaccination?\n18. How was the effectiveness of the vaccines evaluated?\n19. How long was the median time patients on the combined treatment of cyclophosphamide and personalized vaccine were free from cancer progression?\n20. What was the hazard ratio associated with the progression-free survival in the patients that were given the combination treatment?\n21. Were there any changes in plasma IL-6 levels after vaccination?\n22. What effect might an increase in IL-6 levels have on immune responses?\n23. What kind of treatment are the patients receiving?\n24. Why is it important for patients to understand their diagnosis and treatment plan?\n25. What type of 3D printing method was used to create the educational model?\n26. What exactly does the 3D model represent?\n27. What kind of data is used to create the 3D model?\n28. What was the ultimate goal of creating this 3D model?\n29. Was the 3D model created in one go or were there several attempts?\n30. How was the effectiveness of the 3D model evaluated?\n31. Did the 3D model help patients better understand their physician's explanation of treatment options?\n32. Did patients have better understanding of their own anatomy after seeing the 3D model?"}]}
