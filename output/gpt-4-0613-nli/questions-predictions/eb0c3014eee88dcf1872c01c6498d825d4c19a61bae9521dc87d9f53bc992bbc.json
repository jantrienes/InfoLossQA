The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.

What change was observed in the blood after the carbon nanoparticle exposure?\n4. Was the increase in blood neutrophils after the carbon nanoparticles exposure notable or statistically significant?\n5. Was the increase in blood neutrophils dependent on the amount of carbon nanoparticles given?\n6. What was the p-value of the increase in blood neutrophils?\n7. What was the highest dose of carbon nanoparticles administered to individuals?\n8. What effect did the top-dose of 100 \u03bcg of carbon nanoparticles have?\n9. What was the specific measurement that significantly increased with the top-dose of 100 \u03bcg of carbon nanoparticles?\n10. What was the increase in percentage neutrophils in blood compared to?\n11. What was the statistical significance level of the increase in percentage neutrophils in blood?\n12. On what type of cells was the effect observed?\n13. Who were the subjects of the study?\n14. When was the statement or trial registration made?\n15. Under what circumstances was the assessment conducted?\n16. Was the study done based on past data or was it designed to observe outcomes in the future?\n17. Were the evaluators aware of which treatment each patient received in the study?\n18. Was this study an initial test or a full-scale research effort?\n19. Is HA1 known by any other names?\n20. What is another name for HA2?\n21. Does HA3 have another name?\n22. Is there another name for PRP?\n23. What method was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes?\n24. What does MCII stand for and when is it used?\n25. For which two conditions was the MCII applied to measure improvement?\n26. At 18 months, how did the pain and function of the standard care (control) group change in terms of total WOMAC score?\n27. Were there any significant differences between the control group and other treatment groups at 18 months?\n28. When is viscosupplementation used in patients with knee issues?\n29. What specific type of knee damage did the patients in this study have?\n30. For future studies, what recommendations are given in terms of the number of participants?\n31. What other aspects could future studies potentially focus on, besides increasing the number of participants?\n32. To whom would the results of these future larger studies be important or of interest?"}]}
