The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What is known about the effectiveness of the form of radiation therapy used in this treatment approach?\n2. Why is there a limit to the amount of radiation the liver can handle in these treatments?\n3. What specific type of radiotherapy was used in this study?\n4. How was the occurrence of radiation-induced liver injury assessed after treatment?\n5. What type of MRI was used to assess for radiation-induced liver injury?\n6. How did researchers determine the smallest radiation dose that caused injury?\n7. Was there a planned analysis to be undertaken during the study?\n8. What was the smallest mean dose that caused liver injury in the group that did not receive the additional drug treatment?\n9. What proportion of patients who received the combination treatment showed signs of radiation-induced liver injury at 6 weeks?\n10. Can motivational interviewing (MI) be used in scalable interventions?\n11. Can internet resources be used to support these interventions?\n12. Can these interventions help overcome challenges to effectively spread obesity treatment?\n13. Apart from motivational interviewing (MIC), what other intervention was tested in the study?\n14. Where was the treatment conducted?\n15. How were the patients' assessments done?\n16. Were there any changes observed in triglyceride levels, particularly in NPC compared to UC?\n17. Was there a difference in depression scores between participants in NPC and UC?\n18. Was there a significant difference in triglyceride levels between the NPC and MIC groups?\n19. Did the study find a significant difference in triglyceride levels between the UC and MIC groups?\n20. What was the relationship between depression scores in the UC and MIC groups?\n21. Were the weight-loss results sustained even at a 3-month follow-up?\n22. What was the fidelity rating of the interventions?\n23. What makes this study unique in terms of the use of motivational interviewing?\n24. Does this study include an attention-control intervention alongside the other interventions?\n25. What is the attention-control intervention called in this study?\n26. Did one method show consistently better results than the others?\n27. What is the condition that the treatments in the study aim to address?\n28. What kind of study design was used for this research?\n29. How were the treatments assigned to different sides of the each patient's mouth?\n30. What was the additional treatment given to Group B apart from the surgical technique?\n31. What other measurements were taken at the start of the study, besides the depth and width of the gum recession?\n32. What was the severity of the gum recessions treated in the study?"}]}
