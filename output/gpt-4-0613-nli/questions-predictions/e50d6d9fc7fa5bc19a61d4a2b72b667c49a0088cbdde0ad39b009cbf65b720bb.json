The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. How was the trigeminal pain created in this study?\n2. What was the flow rate of the CO2 or air that was insufflated?\n3. Did they conduct another experiment after the first one?\n4. How long were the participants exposed to the treatment or placebo?\n5. Have there been previous studies on the effects of CO2 on trigeminal pain?\n6. What did the recent study find about the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain?\n7. What was the focus of the first experiment in this study?\n8. What was the measured statistical significance for the effect of the main factor GROUP in the first experiment?\n9. Was the interaction between TIME and GROUP significant in the experiment?\n10. What statistical test was used in the experiment to analyze the data?\n11. What type of model was used in the study to evaluate the effect of CO2 on facial pain?\n12. How was the selection of participants for the different vaccine doses determined in this study?\n13. In how many locations was the study carried out?\n14. How many children were given the smaller dose (0.25 ml) of the study vaccine?\n15. How many children were given the larger dose (0.5 ml) of the study vaccine?\n16. How many children were given the smaller dose (0.25 ml) of the vaccine that was being compared to the study vaccine (comparator vaccine)?\n17. Did the performance of all doses of the vaccine meet the standards or criteria set by regulatory bodies?\n18. Did the study look at how participants reacted to the two different doses in terms of side effects (reactogenicity)?\n19. Have other studies been conducted comparing different doses of flu vaccines in young children?\n20. What age group is the main focus of these studies?\n21. Which type of influenza vaccines were used in these studies?\n22. What kind of design was used for the study on low-level laser hearing treatment?\n23.

What happens to the level of omega-6 PUFAs when the levels of EPA and DHA increase?\n26. What is one example of an omega-6 PUFA?\n27. Apart from arachidonic acid, which other fatty acid is an omega-6 PUFA?\n28. What was the duration of the omega-3 PUFA supply in the treatment?\n29. What was the main aim of the study in terms of fatty acid levels?\n30. Which fatty acids were measured in the study?\n31. Where else, apart from the blood plasma, were the fatty acid levels measured?\n32. When were the measurements taken after the cessation of the infusion?"}]}
