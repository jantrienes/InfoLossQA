The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What type of clinical trials were performed according to the original text?\n2. For which part of the trial were the treatment costs calculated, according to the original text?\n3. What type of clinical trials were conducted, as per the original text?\n4. What factors were considered while estimating the average treatment cost in the original text?\n5. How many of the clinical trial protocols referred to in the original statement were in Phase III?\n6. How many of the clinical trial protocols referred to in the original statement spanned both Phase II and Phase III? \n7. How many of the trial protocols in the original text were of Phase II design?\n8. According to the original text, how many of the trials were sponsored by commercial entities?\n9. What specific aspect of the treatment were the studies looking at closely?\n10. What specific phases of cell growth and development were the studies examining?\n11. What ingredient is included in the warming solution?\n12. What stage were the cow egg cells at during the experiments?\n13. How were the cow egg cells divided for the experiments?\n14. What was the name given to the second group in the studies?\n15. What treatment did the cow egg cells in the second group receive?\n16. What substances are included in the vitrification solution 1 (VS1)?\n17. How long and at what temperature were the egg cells in the second group, VS1, exposed to the vitrification solution 1 (VS1)?\n18. What is the name of the third group in the experiments?\n19. What happened to the COCs after they were treated and/or warmed?\n20. What happened to the COCs after they matured?\n21. What happened to the COCs after they were fertilized?\n22. What aspects of the COC's growth and development did the experiment specifically measure?\n23. What part of the treatment process showed no effect on the COC's growth and development?\n24. How were the growth and development rates of the COCs in the Vitrified group affected by the process?\n25. Was the difference in growth and development rates of the COCs between the Vitrified group and the other groups a small random variation or was it a large and meaningful difference?\n26. What were the cell splitting and embryo formation rates of the COCs in the Vitrified group in the first experiment?\n27. What were the cell splitting and embryo formation rates of the COCs in the Control group in the first experiment?\n28. What were the cell splitting and embryo formation rates of the COCs in the VS1 group in the first experiment?\n29. What were the cell splitting and embryo formation rates of the COCs in the VS1 + VS2 group in the first experiment?\n30. What were the cell splitting and embryo formation rates of the COCs in the Vitrified group in the second experiment?\n31. What were the cell splitting and embryo formation rates of the COCs in the Control group in the second experiment?\n32. What were the cell splitting and embryo formation rates of the COCs in the VS1 group in the second experiment?"}]}
