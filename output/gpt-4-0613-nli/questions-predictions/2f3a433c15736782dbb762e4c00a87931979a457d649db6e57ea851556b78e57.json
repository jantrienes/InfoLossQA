The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Is there a way to access information about the trial online?\n2. What is the web address to access detailed information about this trial?\n3. What specific function do the reinforcement signals in the brain play when a person takes drugs?\n4. What methods were applied in this scientific study? \n5. What were the treatment conditions for the heroin-dependent patients in the study?\n6. What was the composition of the control group in this study?\n7. What kind of treatment did the healthy individuals in the control group receive?\n8. What type of analyses were done after the brain imaging data was collected?\n9. What relationship did the researchers aim to establish with the correlation analyses?\n10. Did the researchers seek to find a relationship between the strength of the brain connections and the level of heroin in the patients' blood?\n11. Did the researchers also look for a relationship between the strength of the brain connections and the level of morphine in the patients' blood?\n12. How did heroin impact the connectivity in one specific part of the patients' brain?\n13. How did the use of placebo in the healthy control group impact their brain connectivity?\n14. In which specific brain network did the increased connectivity occur in the healthy participants?\n15. How did the increased brain connectivity in the healthy controls compare to the patients on placebo?\n16. What does the study suggest about the continued reward effect in heroin-dependent patients?\n17. What specific treatments are being compared in this study for liver cancer?\n18. What was the specific condition of all the patients included in the study?\n19. In what pattern were the patients assigned to the treatment groups?\n20. How is it determined when to stop the DEB-TACE treatment?\n21. How often were the patients checked after the treatment?\n22. What type of treatment did the first group receive?\n23. What type of treatment did the second group of patients receive?\n24. How many males and females were included in the SIRT treatment group?\n25. How many males and females were included in the TACE treatment group?\n26. Was there any difference in the initial tumor load between the two treatment groups?\n27. What was the p-value when comparing how long it took for the cancer to spread in the SIRT group versus the TACE group?\n28. What was the median time it took for the cancer to spread for patients in the SIRT group?\n29. What was the median time it took for the cancer to spread for patients in the TACE group or DEB-TACE group?\n30. What was the p-value when comparing the median time it took for the cancer to spread in the SIRT group versus the TACE group?\n31. What was the p-value when comparing the average lifespan of patients in the SIRT group versus the TACE group?\n32. What caused the deaths of some patients in the SIRT group?"}]}
