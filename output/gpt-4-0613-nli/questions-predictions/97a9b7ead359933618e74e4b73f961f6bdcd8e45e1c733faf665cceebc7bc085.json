The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Is there a specific drug that doctors recommend most for helping people stop using illegal drugs? \n2. In what type of healthcare setting is this study conducted? \n3. Do the people in the study know what drug they are getting? \n4. What is the health system in which the study is being conducted? \n5. Where did this trial take place? \n6. Did everybody taking part in the study agree to take part willingly? \n7. Which two drugs were given to people in this study? \n8. How often were the people in the study given the medicine? \n9. How was the buprenorphine administered to the patients in this study?\n10. How was the dihydrocodeine given to patients in this study?\n11. When was a urine sample collected from the people in this study? \n12. By how much did the risk decrease for those given buprenorphine compared to those given dihydrocodeine? \n13. What was the relative risk, or how the risk compared between the two groups, in this study? \n14. What range of results would we expect to see if this study was repeated many times? \n15. What was the statistical significance of the results?\n16. What percent of the people who were given buprenorphine stopped using illegal drugs, according to the urine tests? \n17. What percent of the people who were given dihydrocodeine stopped using drugs, according to the urine tests?\n18. How did the chance of having a clean urine sample compare between those on buprenorphine and those on dihydrocodeine?\n19. What is the range of relative risks we could expect if this study was repeated?\n20. What was the statistical significance of the comparison between those on buprenorphine and those on dihydrocodeine?\n21. How many people stopped using drugs for three months after the study finished?\n22. How much more likely were those on buprenorphine to be abstinent at three months compared to those on dihydrocodeine? \n23. What range of relative risks for abstinence at three months could we expect if this study was repeated? \n24. How many people continued to not use drugs for six months after the study? \n25. How much more likely were those on buprenorphine to be abstinent at six months compared to those on dihydrocodeine? \n26. What types of treatment regimens does this study examine? \n27. What kind of experiment was conducted after the workers were chosen for the program?\n28. How many workers were in the 'at risk' group as per the study's classification?\n29. How many workers were in the 'not at risk' group according to the study's classification?\n30. What was the range of uncertainty regarding the sick leave rates between the 'at risk' and 'not at risk' groups i.e., the confidence interval of the odds ratio?\n31. Were the workers, who were finally included in the test, suitable to be part of the experiment?\n32. What aspect of the program was the study referring to when it mentioned that it was effective?"}]}
