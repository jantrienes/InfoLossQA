The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. Did the 2mg haloperidol group have a higher level of sleepiness or sedation after their surgery compared to the saline group?\n2. Was the difference in sleepiness across the saline, 1mg haloperidol, and 2mg haloperidol groups statistically significant?\n3. Are the study patients at a higher risk of feeling nauseous or vomiting after their surgery?\n4. What sort of procedure are the women in the study going through?\n5. What could cause a negative protein balance in babies?\n6. Besides an increase in protein breakdown, what else can lead to a negative protein balance in infants?\n7. What area was the study focused on in understanding protein levels in the babies?\n8. For how long was the high-protein diet given to the babies in the study?\n9. When was the high-protein diet introduced to the infants in the study?\n10. Was the trial performed in hindsight or was it planned ahead?\n11. How was the trial conducted to limit bias?\n12. What diets were being compared in the trial?\n13. What was the quantity of protein in the high-protein diet given to the babies in the trial?\n14. What was the quantity of protein in the normal diet given to the babies in the trial?\n15. How were the diets given to the infants: orally or through the gastrointestinal tract?\n16. What kind of protein synthesis was measured in the trial?\n17. How were the protein levels in the babies measured?\n18. What specific method was used to measure the protein levels?\n19. What statistical test was used to analyse the data from the trial?\n20. Apart from the Mann-Whitney U test, what other statistical method was used in data analysis?\n21. What was the typical age of the babies in the study?\n22. What was the typical weight of the babies involved in the study?\n23. Was the study able to detect a statistically significant effect with the number of participants it had?\n24. How much valine were the bodies of babies on a high-protein diet producing per minute per kilogram of body weight?\n25. What was the net balance of valine in the bodies of babies on a high-protein diet?\n26. Did the high-protein diet affect oxidation levels in the infants?\n27. Did the high-protein diet affect BUN levels in the infants?\n28. How is the surplus protein from the high-protein diet potentially being used in the body?\n29. Which two diets were being compared when the researchers observed the potential fate of surplus protein?\n30. Which diet group had a surplus of protein in their body?\n31. What might the surplus protein in the high-protein diet cause in the babies?\n32. Why couldn't the researchers draw conclusions about the effect of a high-protein diet on protein levels?"}]}
