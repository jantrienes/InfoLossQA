Dexmedetomidine can cause a biphasic cardiovascular response, and induce transient hypertension. Hypotension is a common complication of spinal anesthesia. Decreasing anxiety of patients before procedure is important for high quality of procedure. This study aimed to compare the incidence of hypotension and patients' anxiety and comfort levels when dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered before and after spinal anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nSeventy-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II were randomly allocated into two groups. Spinal anesthesia was performed using 12 mg of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine. In Group A, 1 \u03bcg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered for 10 min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/hr after 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Patients in Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Perioperative vital signs, anxiety (using the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and comfort (using the numerical rating scale) were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in Group A (16.1%) than in Group B (48.4%) during infusion of dexmedetomidine (p = 0.01). The need for treatment of hypotension is higher in Group B than Group A (p = 0.02). The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation did not significantly differ between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences regarding the patients' anxiety and comfort.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nHypotension is more frequently occurred, and the treatment of hypotension is more needed in Group B. The intravenously administration of dexmedetomidine before spinal anesthesia has no advantages in hemodynamic status and patients' comfort compared to that after spinal anesthesia during lower limb surgery.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02155010. Retrospectively registered on May 22, 2014.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nDexmedetomidine is a drug that helps to reduce pain, anxiety, and causes sleepiness without affecting breathing. However, it can cause changes in blood pressure. Sometimes, after spinal anesthesia, patients can experience low blood pressure. We wanted to understand if giving dexmedetomidine before or after the anesthesia could affect blood pressure changes and patient comfort level.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested this idea on 74 patients, who were all generally healthy or had only mild systemic illness. They were divided into two groups. Both received spinal anesthesia and dexmedetomidine, but the order in which they received the drug was different.\nGroup A received the drug after the anesthesia, while Group B received it before. We monitored their vital signs during and after surgery and also used questionnaires to understand their level of anxiety and comfort.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was a difference in blood pressure changes between the two groups. Fewer patients in Group A experienced low blood pressure compared to Group B. Also, more patients in Group B required treatment for low blood pressure. However, heart rate and oxygen levels were similar in both groups and there were no significant differences in the patients' anxiety and comfort levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study found that more patients experienced low blood pressure and required treatment when given Dexmedetomidine before rather than after spinal anesthesia. However, giving the drug before or after anesthesia didn't make a significant difference in patients' comfort or anxiety levels during lower limb surgeries.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial is recorded in the U.S National Library of Medicine under the identification number NCT02155010 and was first registered on the database on May 22, 2014.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist.\n- Dexmedetomidine has sedative effects.\n- Dexmedetomidine can cause a biphasic cardiovascular response.\n- Dexmedetomidine can induce transient hypertension.\n- Hypotension is a common complication.\n- Decreasing patient anxiety is important.\n- The level of patient anxiety impacts the quality of a procedure.\n- High quality of a procedure is desirable.\n- Dexmedetomidine was administered intravenously in the study.\n- The patients have American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II.\n- The patients were randomly allocated into two groups.\n- The anesthesia was performed using bupivacaine.\n- The bupivacaine used was heavy.\n- The concentration of the bupivacaine used was 0.5%.\n- The amount of bupivacaine used was 12 mg.\n- Group A received 1 \u03bcg/kg of dexmedetomidine intravenously.\n- The dexmedetomidine was administered for 10 minutes.\n- After the dexmedetomidine administration, a maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/hr was given.\n- The maintenance infusion was given after 5 minutes of intrathecal bupivacaine injection.\n- The bupivacaine injection was intrathecal.\n- The dexmedetomidine was administered intravenously.\n- The dexmedetomidine was administered before 5 minutes of intrathecal bupivacaine injection.\n- The patients received the same dose of dexmedetomidine.\n- The patients received an intrathecal bupivacaine injection.\n- The Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to evaluate anxiety.\n- The numerical rating scale was used to evaluate comfort.\n- The incidence of hypotension in Group A was 16.1%.\n- The incidence of hypotension in Group B was 48.4%.\n- The p-value of the comparison was 0.01.\n- Hypotension treatment is needed in both groups.\n- The difference in the need for hypotension treatment between Group A and Group B is statistically significant.\n- The p-value of the difference is 0.02.\n- The incidence of bradycardia was measured in both groups.\n- The incidence of desaturation was measured in both groups.\n- There was no significant difference in the incidence of desaturation between the two groups.\n- The differences in patients' anxiety and comfort were statistically analyzed.\n- Hypotension occurs more frequently in Group B.\n- Dexmedetomidine is administered intravenously before spinal anesthesia.\n- Dexmedetomidine is also administered intravenously after spinal anesthesia.\n- The registration was done retrospectively.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
