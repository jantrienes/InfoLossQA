The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal NV areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal NV areas were compared before and after the injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nSeven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal NV secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). In group I, the preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 \u00b1 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 \u00b1 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 \u00b1 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). The corneal NV area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 \u00b1 4.33% to 6.72 \u00b1 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal NV area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 \u00b1 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 \u00b1 11.64%, p = 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal NV compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal NV require further investigation.\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis study aims to compare the short-term effects of two kinds of injections, namely, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, on the shrinking of unusual blood vessels in the cornea (the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the eye).\n\nMETHODS.\nSixteen patients suffering from abnormal blood vessels in the cornea were randomly chosen to receive one of either a bevacizumab or ranibizumab injection. They were checked before the injection, a week after the injection, and a month after the injection to measure how much their blood vessels shrunk. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe patients, aged around 51, developed abnormal blood vessels in the cornea due to various reasons like eye infections or chemical burns. After the bevacizumab injection, a clear reduction in unusual blood vessels was noticed both a week and a month after the treatment. The ranibizumab injection also resulted in reduced abnormal vessels after a week, but the change was not significant a month later. In group 1, treated with bevacizumab, the shrinkage in unusual vessels was significantly higher than in group 2, treated with ranibizumab.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study concluded that bevacizumab injection was more effective in reducing the unusual blood vessel growth in the cornea compared to the ranibizumab injection. However, further research is needed to understand the effectiveness and the right dosage of these two treatments.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study is related to corneal neovascularization (NV).\n- Sixteen eyes of 16 patients had corneal NV.\n- One group of patients (group 1) was assigned to receive an injection of 2.5 mg of bevacizumab.\n- Group 1 consisted of 8 patients.\n- Another group of patients (group 2) was assigned to receive an injection of 1 mg of ranibizumab.\n- Group 2 consisted of 8 patients.\n- The injections were administered through subconjunctival and intrastromal routes.\n- The follow-up was prospective.\n- The follow-up period lasted for one month.\n- Corneal NV areas were calculated.\n- The corneal NV areas were shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs.\n- The corneal slit-lamp photographs were stored in JPEG format.\n- Image J software was used to calculate the corneal NV areas.\n- The calculation was done before the injection.\n- Seven women presented with corneal NV.\n- Nine men presented with corneal NV.\n- The average age of the patients is 51 years.\n- Seven cases of corneal NV are due to herpetic keratitis.\n- Six cases of corneal NV are due to graft rejection.\n- One case of corneal NV is due to pemphigoid.\n- One case of corneal NV is due to a recurrent ulcer.\n- The preoperative corneal NV area in group I was 8.75 \u00b1 4.33%.\n- The corneal NV area in group I decreased to 5.62 \u00b1 3.86% one week after the injection.\n- The corneal NV area in group I further decreased to 6.35 \u00b1 3.02% one month after the injection.\n- The decrease in corneal NV area one week after the injection was statistically significant (p = 0.012).\n- The decrease in corneal NV area one month after the injection was also statistically significant (p = 0.012).\n- The initial corneal NV area in group 2 was 7.37 \u00b1 4.33%.\n- The corneal NV area in group 2 changed to 6.72 \u00b1 4.16% one week after the injection.\n- The p-value of the change in corneal NV area in group 2 was 0.012.\n- The change in the corneal NV area in group 2 was observed one week after the injection.\n- The mean decrease in corneal NV area in group 1 is 28.4%.\n- The standard deviation of the decrease in corneal NV area in group 1 is 9.01%.\n- The mean decrease in corneal NV area in group 2 is 4.51%.\n- The standard deviation of the decrease in corneal NV area in group 2 is 11.64%.\n- The p-value of the comparison between group 1 and group 2 is 0.001.\n- Bevacizumab injection resulted in regression of corneal NV.\n- Ranibizumab injection resulted in regression of corneal NV.\n- The regression of corneal NV from Bevacizumab injection was more stable than the ranibizumab injection.\n- There are two drugs being considered for the regression of corneal NV.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
