teams designed and implemented two health worker in-service training approaches: 1) an off-site classroom-based integrated management of infectious diseases (IMID) course with distance learning aspects, and 2) on-site support (OSS), an educational outreach intervention. We tested the effects of OSS on workload and 12 facility performance indicators for emergency triage assessment and treatment, HIV testing, and malaria and pneumonia case management among outpatients by two subgroups: 1) mid-level practitioners (MLP) who attended IMID training (IMID-MLP) and 2) health workers who did not (No-IMID).\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-six health facilities participated in the IDCAP trial, with 18 randomly assigned to Arm A and 18 to Arm B. Two MLP in both arms received IMID. All providers at Arm A facilities received nine monthly OSS visits from April to December 2010 while Arm B did not. From November 2009 to December 2010, 777,667 outpatient visits occurred. We analyzed 669,580 (86.1 %) outpatient visits, where provider cadre was reported. Treatment was provided by 64 IMID-MLP and 1,515 No-IMID providers. The effect of OSS was measured by the difference in pre/post changes across arms after controlling for covariates (adjusted ratio of relative risks = a RRR).\n\nRESULTS.\nThe effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among IMID-MLP (aRRR = 1.21; p = 0.48) and No-IMID (aRRR = 0.90; p = 0.44) was not statistically significant. Among IMID-MLP, OSS was effective for three indicators: malaria cases receiving an appropriate antimalarial (aRRR = 1.26, 99 % CI = 1.02-1.56), patients with negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial (aRRR = 0.49, 99 % CI = 0.26-0.92), and patients with acid-fast bacilli smear negative result receiving empiric treatment for acute respiratory infection (aRRR = 2.04, 99 % CI = 1.06-3.94). Among No-IMID, OSS was effective for two indicators: emergency and priority patients admitted, detained or referred (aRRR = 2.12, 99 % CI = 1.05-4.28) and emergency patients receiving at least one appropriate treatment (aRRR = 1.98, 99 % CI = 1.21-3.24).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nEffects of OSS on workload were not statistically significant. Significant OSS effects on facility performance across subgroups were heterogeneous. OSS supported MLP who diagnosed and treated patients to apply IMID knowledge. For other providers, OSS supported team work to manage emergency patients. This evidence on OSS effectiveness could inform interventions to improve health workers' capacity to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article 10.1186/s12889-016-3375-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was about how we can improve how health workers diagnose and treat infectious diseases. We tried two different methods: a special classroom training that covered all aspects of managing infectious diseases, and on-the-job, hands-on guidance. The aim was to see if the hands-on guidance, or On-Site Support (OSS), made a difference in how health workers handled emergency cases, HIV testing, and treatment of malaria and pneumonia patients. Specifically, we wanted to compare how health workers who had gone through the classroom training performed against those who hadn't.\n\nMETHODS.\n36 health facilities took part in the study, split evenly into two groups. Two health workers from each group were chosen to go through the special classroom training. Everyone in one group got hands-on guidance for nine months, while the other group did not. We analyzed almost a year's worth of outpatient visits (over 669,000) in which the care provider was mentioned, to see what effect the hands-on guidance had.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that having on-site guidance didn't significantly change the number of patients a health worker saw each day. But for health workers who had been through the classroom training, the guidance helped in three areas: treating malaria correctly, not prescribing antimalarial drugs if a test was negative, and treating respiratory infections in people who tested negative for tuberculosis. For health workers who hadn't been through the special classroom training, the guidance was helpful in managing emergency patients better.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWhile on-site guidance didn't change how many patients a healthcare worker saw, it did show positive effects on how they managed patients, especially in emergency situations. This sort of hands-on guidance seems to help health workers use their training better, and improve care. These findings could help improve interventions to improve the capacity of health workers to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nThere is more material related to this study available online for those with proper authorization.\n\n## Missing facts\n- IDCAP teams designed and implemented two health worker in-service training approaches.\n- The first approach is an off-site classroom-based integrated management of infectious diseases (IMID) course.\n- The IMID course includes distance learning aspects.\n- OSS is an educational outreach intervention.\n- A test was conducted on the effects of OSS on workload and 12 facility performance indicators.\n- The test was also conducted on emergency triage assessment and treatment.\n- One subgroup consisted of mid-level practitioners who attended IMID training (IMID-MLP).\n- Two MLP in Arm A received IMID.\n- Two MLP in Arm B received IMID.\n- Providers at Arm A facilities received OSS visits.\n- The OSS visits to Arm A facilities occurred monthly.\n- The OSS visits to Arm A facilities happened from April to December 2010.\n- There were nine OSS visits to Arm A facilities.\n- Arm B facilities did not receive any OSS visits from April to December 2010.\n- Outpatient visits occurred from November 2009 to December 2010.\n- The total number of outpatient visits from November 2009 to December 2010 was 777,667.\n- A total of 669,580 outpatient visits were analyzed.\n- The analyzed outpatient visits represent 86.1% of the total visits.\n- Treatment was provided by IMID-MLP providers.\n- There were 64 IMID-MLP providers who provided treatment.\n- Treatment was also provided by No-IMID providers.\n- There were 1,515 No-IMID providers who provided treatment.\n- The measurement process controlled for covariates.\n- The adjusted ratio of relative risks (a RRR) was used in the measurement process.\n- The study examined the effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among IMID-MLP.\n- The study also examined the effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among No-IMID.\n- The adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) for IMID-MLP was 1.21.\n- The p-value for IMID-MLP was 0.48.\n- The adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) for No-IMID was 0.90.\n- The p-value for No-IMID was 0.44.\n- The effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among IMID-MLP was not statistically significant.\n- The effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among No-IMID was not statistically significant.\n- OSS was effective for three indicators in IMID-MLP.\n- One of the indicators is malaria cases receiving an appropriate antimalarial.\n- The adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) for malaria cases receiving an appropriate antimalarial is 1.26.\n- The 99% confidence interval (CI) for malaria cases receiving an appropriate antimalarial is 1.02-1.56.\n- Another indicator is patients with negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial.\n- The aRRR for patients with negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial is 0.49.\n- The 99% CI for patients with negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial is 0.26-0.92.\n- The third indicator is patients with acid-fast bacilli smear negative result receiving empiric treatment for acute respiratory infection.\n- The aRRR for patients with acid-fast bacilli smear negative result receiving empiric treatment for acute respiratory infection is 2.04.\n- OSS was effective for two indicators among No-IMID.\n- One of the indicators was emergency and priority patients admitted, detained or referred.\n- The adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) for this indicator was 2.12.\n- The 99% confidence interval (CI) for this indicator was 1.05-4.28.\n- The other indicator was emergency patients receiving at least one appropriate treatment.\n- The adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) for this indicator was 1.98.\n- The 99% confidence interval (CI) for this indicator was 1.21-3.24.\n- The study found no statistically significant effects of OSS on workload.\n- There are significant OSS effects on facility performance.\n- These effects are heterogeneous across subgroups.\n- OSS supported MLP.\n- OSS supports team work.\n- The article has the identifier 10.1186/s12889-016-3375-4.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
