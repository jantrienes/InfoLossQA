This means it assumes the starting measurements, often for health indicators, are the same for both groups being compared.\n\n- Fact: GMC conducted a longitudinal RCT.\n- Question: What type of study was conducted by the Group Medical Clinics (GMC)?\n- Answer: The Group Medical Clinics (GMC) conducted a longitudinal randomised controlled trial (RCT), which is a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to different groups that receive different treatments, and the participants are followed over a certain period of time to see the effects of the treatments.\n\n- Fact: The analysis was conducted on an illustrated example.\n- Question: Was the analysis carried out on real data or a hypothetical example?\n- Answer: The analysis was carried out on an illustrated example, which can help show how these methods work in a more simplified or theoretical manner.\n\n- Fact: All models were fit using linear mixed models.\n- Question: What type of statistical method was used for fitting all the models in the analysis?\n- Answer: All models in the analysis, including ANCOVA, LDA, and cLDA, were fit using statistical methods known as linear mixed models.

'Constrained' longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) is a well-established unconditional technique that constrains means of baseline to be equal between arms. We use an analysis of fasting lipid profiles from the Group Medical Clinics (GMC) longitudinal RCT on patients with diabetes to illustrate applications of ANCOVA, LDA and cLDA to demonstrate theoretical concepts of these methods including the impact of missing data.\n\nMETHODS.\nFor the analysis of the illustrated example, all models were fit using linear mixed models to participants with only complete data and to participants using all available data.\n\nRESULTS.\nWith complete data (n=195), 95% CI coverage are equivalent for ANCOVA and cLDA with an estimated 11.2 mg/dL (95% CI \u221219.2 to \u22123.3; p=0.006) lower mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in GMC compared with usual care. With all available data (n=233), applying the cLDA model yielded an LDL improvement of 8.9 mg/dL (95% CI \u221216.7 to \u22121.0; p=0.03) for GMC compared with usual care. The less efficient, LDA analysis yielded an LDL improvement of 7.2 mg/dL (95% CI \u221217.2 to 2.8; p=0.15) for GMC compared with usual care.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUnder reasonable missing data assumptions, cLDA will yield efficient treatment effect estimates and robust inferential statistics. It may be regarded as the method of choice over ANCOVA and LDA.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL\nWe want to understand the best way to analyze data from a study that is comparing two treatments for diabetes. This type of study is usually done by comparing the baseline, or starting, measurements of the patients' blood fat levels (fasting lipid profiles) to follow-up measurements taken after some time. There are traditional ways to do this comparison (like ANCOVA and LDA), but we're also exploring a different approach, called cLDA, that assumes the starting measurements are the same for both treatments. We want to see which method is the most reliable, considering some patients might not complete the trial.\n\nHOW WE DID IT\nWe analyzed data from a study conducted at Group Medical Clinics (GMC) using all three methods -ANCOVA, LDA, and cLDA- and compared the results. We ran these tests on data from patients who finished the trial and also on data that includes patients who didn't finish.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\nWhen we used data from patients who completed the trial (195 people), both ANCOVA and cLDA showed that the GMC treatment lowered bad cholesterol levels (LDL) by about 11.2 mg/dL, significantly more than the usual care. When we used all available data (233 people), cLDA showed an LDL improvement of 8.9 mg/dL with the GMC treatment, but LDA showed only a 7.2 mg/dL improvement and wasn't as sure of this result.\n\nWHAT IT MEANS\nIf we take into account that some people might not complete the trial, cLDA seems to produce consistent and reliable results. It evaluates the effect of treatment very efficiently and its findings can be trusted. Thus, it may be a better choice compared to ANCOVA and LDA when looking at this type of data.\n\n## Missing facts\n- 'Constrained' longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) is a well-established technique.\n- The equal constraint in cLDA is applied between arms.\n- GMC conducted a longitudinal RCT.\n- The analysis was conducted on an illustrated example.\n- All models were fit using linear mixed models.\n- cLDA can provide robust inferential statistics.\n- This method is preferred over ANCOVA.\n- This method is also preferred over LDA.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
