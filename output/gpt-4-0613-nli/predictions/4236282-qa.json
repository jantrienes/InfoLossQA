Scalable interventions utilizing motivational interviewing (MI), supported by internet resources, may overcome obstacles to effective obesity treatment dissemination. This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing two web-supported interventions, motivational interviewing (MIC) and nutrition psychoeducation (NPC), an attention-control intervention, to usual care (UC).\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS.\n89 overweight/obese patients, with and without binge eating disorder (BED), were randomly assigned to MIC, NPC, or UC for 3 months in PC. Patients were assessed independently at post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up\n\nRESULTS.\nWeight, triglyceride levels, and depression scores decreased significantly in NPC when compared to UC but not MIC; UC and MIC did not differ significantly. Weight-loss results maintained at 3-month follow-up: approximately 25% MIC and NPC patients achieved at least 5% weight-loss which did not differ by BED status. Fidelity ratings were high and treatment adherence was associated with weight loss.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis is the first RCT in PC testing MI for obesity to include an attention-control intervention (NPC). NPC, but not MI, showed a consistent pattern of superior benefits relative to UC. BED status was not associated but treatment adherence was associated with weight loss outcomes.\n\n## Simplification\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe goal of this study was to see if a doctor's office would be a good place to help people lose weight, specifically using two different internet-based methods: one focusing on helpful conversations (MIC), and the other on understanding the mental side of dieting (NPC). The results were compared to people who received standard care (UC).\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS.\nThe study involved 89 overweight people, some of whom also struggled with binge eating disorder (BED). These participants were randomly assigned to one of the three approaches (MIC, NPC, or UC) for three months. Afterword, the researchers checked on their progress and followed up with them 3 months later.\n\nRESULTS.\nParticipants who received NPC showed a greater reduction in weight, blood fat levels, and feelings of sadness compared to UC and MIC. However, there was no significant difference between UC and MIC. About 25% of participants in the MIC and NPC groups achieved at least 5% weight loss at the 3-month follow-up. This result was not impacted by whether or not the participant had binge eating disorder. The success of the treatment was linked to how well the participant stuck with the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis is the first study of its kind to test motivational interviewing as a method for weight loss in a primary care setting, while also testing a control intervention (NPC). The NPC method showed better results than MIC or standard care. Binge eating disorder did not affect the results, but sticking to the treatment did improve weight loss outcomes.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Scalable interventions can utilize motivational interviewing (MI).\n- These interventions can be supported by internet resources.\n- These interventions may overcome obstacles to effective obesity treatment dissemination.\n- The other intervention tested was nutrition psychoeducation (NPC).\n- The treatment was conducted in PC.\n- The assessments of the patients were done independently.\n- Triglyceride levels decreased significantly in NPC compared to UC.\n- Depression scores decreased significantly in NPC compared to UC.\n- Triglyceride levels did not decrease significantly in NPC when compared to MIC.\n- There was no significant difference in triglyceride levels between UC and MIC.\n- There was no significant difference in depression scores between UC and MIC.\n- Weight-loss results were maintained at a 3-month follow-up.\n- Fidelity ratings were high.\n- This is the first RCT in PC testing MI for obesity.\n- The RCT includes an attention-control intervention.\n- The attention-control intervention is referred to as NPC.\n- NPC showed a consistent pattern of superior benefits.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
