containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45\u201360 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.\n\nRESULTS.\nCleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND\nThis study checked how deep freezing (vitrification) and other related factors affect the growth and development of immature cow egg cells (also called COCs).\n\nMETHODS\nWe did two experiments. In the first experiment, we had 420 COCs separated into four groups: Group 1 received no treatment. Group 2 was exposed to a special freezing mixture for 5 minutes. Group 3 got the same freeze mix, then a second mix for 45-60 seconds. Group 4 went through the same steps as group 3, but these COCs were also fast-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then warmed up quickly. In the second experiment, we treated 581 COCs the same way but also had some of the COCs from groups 2, 3 and 4 spend either 1 or 5 minutes in a warming solution. All COCs from both experiments were then grown and fertilized in a lab.\n\nRESULTS\nWe noticed that the rate at which the COCs grew and developed was the same for groups 1, 2 and 3, no matter how long they spent in the warming solution. But for the group 4 COCs\u2014the ones that had been fast-frozen and heated up again\u2014their growth and development rates were much lower.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe concluded that the freezing mixes and the time spent in the warming solution did not negatively affect the COCs. The fast-freezing and quick warming, however, did decrease how well these cow egg cells grew and developed.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The studies are evaluating the effects of time in the warming solution containing sucrose.\n- The effects are being evaluated on cleavage and embryo development.\n- The warming solution contains sucrose.\n- The bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes are at the GV stage.\n- The COCs were randomly assigned to four groups.\n- The second group is the VS1 group.\n- The VS1 group's COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1).\n- VS1 contains 7.5% ethylene glycol (EG), 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 20% calf serum (CS) in TCM-199.\n- The VS1 group's COCs were exposed to VS1 at 37 C for 5 min.\n- The third group is the VS1 + VS2 group.\n- After treatment and/or warming, the COCs underwent in vitro maturation.\n- After maturation, the COCs underwent in vitro fertilization.\n- After fertilization, the COCs underwent in vitro culture.\n- The experiment measured cleavage and blastocyst rates.\n- The lack of effect was specifically in relation to the warming solution.\n- The cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower in the Vitrified group.\n- The difference in rates between the Vitrified group and the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001).\n- In Experiment 1, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in the Vitrified group were 40.9% and 1.6% respectively.\n- In Experiment 1, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in the Control group were 92.2% and 34.4% respectively.\n- In Experiment 1, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in the VS1 group were 79.4% and 25.2% respectively.\n- In Experiment 1, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in the VS1 + VS2 group were 80.2% and 20.8% respectively.\n- In Experiment 2, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in the Vitrified group were 25.0% and 1.7% respectively.\n- In Experiment 2, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in the Control group were 75.3% and 27.2% respectively.\n- In Experiment 2, the cleavage and blastocyst rates in the VS1 group were 67.9% and 19.5% respectively.\n- The COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2 solutions.\n- VS1 and VS2 solutions contain permeating cryoprotectants.\n- The cryoprotectants in the solutions are EG and DMSO.\n- The COCs were also exposed to a warming solution containing sucrose.\n- The time in the warming solution had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of the COCs.\n- The cryoprotectants EG and DMSO had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of the COCs.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
