Participants either received (n = 50) the PAPP for 60 minutes, twice a week during three months or (n = 50) they received health education. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured by general state of health the Short Form 12 health survey questionnaire, and the quality of life was determined with the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire. Cardiopulmonary function was measured with a spirometry and a walking test according to the Bruce protocol.\n\nRESULTS.\nThis pilot study had a significant impact on the quality of life (p = 0.05) in men, which increased. However, the quality of life in women did not improve. The average changes in the lung and cardiovascular function was not significant between groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nChanges in the quality of life measured with EQ-5D in the group of men who carried out the PAPP were statistically significant when comparing between groups. However changes in cardiopulmonary function were not as relevant when comparing between groups. There was a significant effect within each group in the pulmonary outcomes of values in men, within the experimental group.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDeveloped by the University of Ma\u0301laga. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01172483.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nWe're looking into how an exercise program, the Physical Activity Promotion Programme (PAPP), affects heart health and quality of life in inactive individuals over 55 years old. We're comparing the results to a group of people who did not do the program.\n\nMETHOD.\nWe studied 100 people, men and women, from Torremolinos, Spain. Half of them did the PAPP for an hour twice a week for three months, the rest were given health education. We used questionnaires and health tests to measure how well their hearts and lungs were working, and how much their quality of life improved.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall, the program improved the quality of life in men, but not women. There wasn't a notable change in the heart and lung function for either group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe PAPP program was found to help improve quality of life for men but didn't show significant improvements in heart and lung function for anyone. Interestingly, men in the exercise group did see some improvements in lung outcomes.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study was conducted by the University of M\u00e1laga and you can find more details about it under the ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01172483.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The purpose is also to assess quality of life values.\n- The trial was a randomized controlled trial.\n- Systematic random sampling was used in the trial.\n- The PAPP was administered for 60 minutes.\n- The Short Form 12 health survey questionnaire was used to measure the intervention's effectiveness.\n- The EuroQoL-5D questionnaire was used to determine the quality of life.\n- The measurement used a spirometry.\n- The measurement also used a walking test.\n- The walking test was conducted according to the Bruce protocol.\n- The study is a pilot study.\n- The study had a significant impact on the quality of life.\n- The p-value of the study is 0.05.\n- The quality of life in this group was measured with EQ-5D.\n- These changes were statistically significant.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\"). For each fact, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text (\"Original\"). Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary.
