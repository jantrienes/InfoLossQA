The purpose of this study is to characterize, in vivo, carotid arterial structural and functional changes by applying radio frequency and X-strain ultrasound techniques.\n\nMETHODS.\nNinety-one subjects were assigned into two groups; a diabetes group and a control group. Structural and functional changes in the common carotid arterial wall were investigated by quality intima-media thickness (QIMT), quality arterial stiffness (QAS), and X-strain analysis with a Mylab Twice ultrasound instrument. The relationships among variables between the two groups were analyzed in this study.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was no significant difference in carotid IMT (626.5 \u00b1 169.1 \u03bcm vs. 568.5 \u00b1 122.6 \u03bcm, P = 0.1506) between two groups. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and stiffness index (\u03b2) were remarkably greater (8.388 \u00b1 3.254 m/s vs. 7.269 \u00b1 1.332 m/s; 12.51 \u00b1 14.16 vs.9.279 \u00b1 2.871), while compliance coefficient (CC) decreased significantly in the diabetes group (0.802 \u00b1 0.3094 mm2/Kpa vs. 0.968 \u00b1 0.3992 mm2/Kpa) (P < 0.05). The displacement difference of radial (RD-D), longitudinal (LD-D) and rotation (ROT-D) directions were significantly different between two groups' comparison (P = 0.0212, P = 0.0235 and P = 0.0072, respectively). The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) and the time of radial peak strain rate (RSR-T) were found to be significantly different between the two groups (341.9 \u00b1 77.56 ms vs. 369.0 \u00b1 78.26 ms, P = 0.0494; 142.7 \u00b1 22.43 ms vs. 136.2 \u00b1 30.70 ms, P = 0.0474). CS-TD and RSR-T were also found to be positively correlated with CC value (r = 0.3908, P < 0.005 and r = 0.3027, P = 0.0326, respectively). Finally, PWV was negatively correlated with CC with (r = \u20130.6177, P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn type 2 diabetes, the functional changes in CCA can be identified using the methods presented in this article earlier than the structural changes. Arterial stiffness values provided by QAS and X-strain analysis can be used as indicators of CCA functional lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are more likely to suffer from heart diseases because diabetes can cause the arteries to become stiff. This particular study attempts to study these arterial changes in detail by using two different techniques that use sound waves.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe test involved 91 individuals who were divided into two groups: one with diabetes and one without (the control group). By using a device that transmitted sound waves, we studied changes in the wall of an artery in the neck known as the carotid artery. We then compared the findings of the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe thickness of the wall of the carotid artery was pretty similar in both groups. However, the speed at which the pulse travelled and the stiffness of the artery were notably higher in the group with diabetes, whereas the artery's flexibility was significantly lower. The differences in how the arteries moved and adjusted were also significant between the two groups. Additionally, the time taken for certain changes to happen in the arteries were significantly different between the two groups. These time measures were also found to be linked positively with the flexibility of the arteries, whereas the pulse speed was linked negatively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, we can identify functional changes in the carotid artery earlier than structural changes by using the methods described in this study. This suggests the degree of stiffness and elasticity of the artery can serve as indicators of functional issues in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study is conducted in vivo.\n- The study uses X-strain ultrasound techniques.\n- The investigation used quality intima-media thickness (QIMT).\n- The investigation also used quality arterial stiffness (QAS).\n- X-strain analysis was another method used in the investigation.\n- A Mylab Twice ultrasound instrument was used in the investigation.\n- The first value of carotid IMT was 626.5 \u00b1 169.1 \u03bcm.\n- The measurement is 568.5 \u03bcm.\n- The measurement has an uncertainty of \u00b1 122.6 \u03bcm.\n- The P-value is 0.1506.\n- The P-value indicates that the difference between the two groups is not statistically significant.\n- The value of the greater pulse wave velocity (PWV) is 8.388 \u00b1 3.254 m/s.\n- Stiffness index (\u03b2) was also remarkably greater.\n- The first value is 7.269 \u00b1 1.332 m/s.\n- The compliance coefficient (CC) decreased significantly in the diabetes group.\n- The value of the compliance coefficient (CC) in the diabetes group is 0.802 \u00b1 0.3094 mm2/Kpa.\n- The uncertainty or error margin of the measurement is \u00b1 0.3992 mm2/Kpa.\n- The P-value is less than 0.05.\n- The results are statistically significant as the P-value is less than 0.05.\n- The P-value for the displacement difference in the radial direction (RD-D) is 0.0212.\n- The displacement difference in the longitudinal direction (LD-D) is significant.\n- The P-value for the displacement difference in the longitudinal direction (LD-D) is 0.0235.\n- The displacement difference in the rotation direction (ROT-D) is significant.\n- The P-value for the displacement difference in the rotation direction (ROT-D) is 0.0072.\n- The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) is being measured.\n- The time of radial peak strain rate (RSR-T) is being measured.\n- The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) for one group is 341.9 \u00b1 77.56 ms.\n- The P-value of the data is 0.0494.\n- CS-TD is positively correlated with CC value.\n- The correlation coefficient (r) between CS-TD and CC value is 0.3908.\n- The P-value for the correlation between CS-TD and CC value is less than 0.005.\n- RSR-T is positively correlated with CC value.\n- The correlation coefficient (r) between RSR-T and CC value is 0.3027.\n- The P-value for the correlation between RSR-T and CC value is 0.0326.\n- The correlation coefficient between PWV and CC is -0.6177.\n- The correlation between PWV and CC is statistically significant with a P value less than 0.001.\n- Arterial stiffness values can be provided by QAS.\n- Arterial stiffness values can be provided by X-strain analysis.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
