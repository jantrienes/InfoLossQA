researchers check any other blood pressure measures from the patients?\n- Answer: Yes, the diastolic blood pressure, which is a measure of the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats, was also assessed for all patients.\n\n- Fact: Heart rate (HR) was assessed in all patients.\n- Question: Did the researchers check the heart rate of the patients?\n- Answer: Yes, the heart rate of all the patients was monitored throughout the study.\n\n- Fact: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was assessed in all patients.\n- Question: Did the study monitor the average pressure in the arteries of the patients?\n- Answer: Yes, the mean arterial pressure, which is a calculation of the average pressure in a patient's arteries during one cardiac cycle, was also tracked by the researchers. \n\n- Fact: The standard deviation of the patients' ages is 10.8 years.\n- Question: What was the range of different ages of the patients in this study?\n- Answer: The standard deviation of the patients' ages was 10.8 years, meaning the ages of the patients varied around the average age by approximately this amount.\n\n- Fact: The mean Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) at minute 2 and minute 5 showed no significant difference between groups.\n- Question: Were there any differences in blood pressure right after the saline solutions were given?\n- Answer: No, there wasn't any significant difference in the systolic blood pressure, the pressure in the arteries during a heartbeat, between the group who received hypertonic saline and the group who received normal saline after 2 and 5 minutes of the infusion process.\n\n- Fact: A P-value greater than 0.05 indicates no significant difference.\n- Question: What does a p-value greater than 0.05 mean?\n- Answer: In research studies, a p-value greater than 0.05 is often used as the threshold to indicate that the difference observed between groups isn't significant, meaning it could have happened by chance.\n\n- Fact: A P-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant difference.\n- Question: What does a p-value less than 0.05 mean?\n- Answer: In research studies, a p-value less than 0.05 is typically used to indicate that the difference observed between groups is statistically significant, meaning it's unlikely to have happened by chance. \n\n- Fact: The significance level for the difference in trends is P > 0.05.\n- Question: Were there significant trends over time in the data?\n- Answer: The overall trends over time in blood pressure and heart rate between the two groups did not differ significantly, as indicated by the p-value being greater than 0.05.\n\n- Fact: Hypertonic saline 5% was infused before the general anesthesia.\n- Question: At what time was the hypertonic saline given to the patients?\n- Answer: The hypertonic saline, the strong salt solution, was administered to the patients before the general anesthesia was used to put them to sleep for surgery.\n\n- Fact: The dosage of hypertonic saline 5% used was 2.3 mg/kg.\n- Question: What dose of the hypertonic saline solution was given to the patients?\n- Answer: The hypertonic saline solution was administered at a dosage of 2.3 milligrams per kilogram of the patient's body weight.\n\n- Fact: The infusion of hypertonic saline 5% led to a reduction in MAP.\n- Question: How did the administration of hypertonic saline affect the average pressure in the arteries?\n- Answer: The infusion of the hypertonic saline solution led to a reduction in the mean arterial pressure of the patients, which is the average blood pressure in an individual's arteries during one heartbeat.\n\n- Fact: The infusion of hypertonic saline 5% led to a reduced heart rate.\n- Question: How was the heart rate affected by the hypertonic saline infusion?\n- Answer: The hypertonic saline infusion resulted in a reduction of the heart rate in patients, this means their hearts beat less times per minute after the saline solution was administered.\n\n- Fact: There were no episodes of severe hypotension after the infusion of hypertonic saline 5%.\n- Question: Were there any severe episodes of low blood pressure after the hypertonic saline was given?\n- Answer: No. Despite the reduction in mean arterial pressure and heart rate, the patients given hypertonic saline did not experience any severe episodes of low blood pressure."},

hypotension following induction of general anesthesia.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nFifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe mean age of patients was 36.68 \u00b1 10.8 years. Forty percent of patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean of DBP at min 2, 5, and 15, mean of HR at all time points and mean of MAP at min 2 and 15 between groups were no significantly different (P > 0.05), but mean of SBP at min 10 and 15, mean of DBP at min 10, and mean of MAP at min 5 and 10 in hypertonic saline group was significantly more than the normal group (P < 0.05). Trend of SBP, DBP, HR and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nInfusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was focused on looking at how giving a strong salt solution (hypertonic saline) by IV before surgery influences low blood pressure that can happen after putting a patient to sleep for the surgery.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe studied 54 patients who were going to have surgery. They were divided into two groups of 27 people each - one group was given a strong salt solution and the other was given a normal salt solution. The strong salt solution was given half an hour before the patient was put to sleep for surgery. We followed the same anesthesia process for all patients. We kept track of the patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, heart rate, and the average pressure in their arteries.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe average age of the patients was about 37 years old, and 40% of them were men. We found that the strong salt solution didn't have a significant effect on the patients' blood pressure or heart rate at certain time points. However, other time points showed a significant increase in the blood pressure and average arterial pressure for patients who were given the strong salt solution.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nGiving a strong salt solution to patients before putting them to sleep for surgery can help avoid a big drop in blood pressure and a faster heart rate. It means there will be less chance of severe low blood pressure episodes.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Fifty-four patients were scheduled for elective surgery.\n- These patients were randomly allocated to two groups.\n- One group received hypertonic saline 5%.\n- The dosage for hypertonic saline 5% was 2.3 ml/kg.\n- The other group received normal saline.\n- The dosage for normal saline was 13 ml/kg.\n- The infusion process lasted for 30 minutes.\n- Sex was assessed in all patients.\n- Body mass index (BMI) was assessed in all patients.\n- Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was assessed in all patients.\n- Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was assessed in all patients.\n- Heart rate (HR) was assessed in all patients.\n- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was assessed in all patients.\n- The standard deviation of the patients' ages was calculated.\n- The standard deviation of the patients' ages is 10.8 years.\n- The mean Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) at minute 2 and minute 5 showed no significant difference between groups.\n- The mean Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) at minute 2, 5, and 15 showed no significant difference between groups.\n- The mean Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) at minute 2 and 15 showed no significant difference between groups.\n- The mean SBP at minute 10 and 15 in the hypertonic saline group was significantly higher than the normal group.\n- The mean DBP at minute 10 in the hypertonic saline group was significantly higher than the normal group.\n- The mean MAP at minute 5 and 10 in the hypertonic saline group was significantly higher than the normal group.\n- A P-value greater than 0.05 indicates no significant difference.\n- A P-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant difference.\n- The significance level for the difference in trends is P > 0.05.\n- Hypertonic saline 5% was infused before the general anesthesia.\n- The dosage of hypertonic saline 5% used was 2.3 mg/kg.\n- The infusion of hypertonic saline 5% led to a reduction in MAP.\n- The infusion of hypertonic saline 5% led to a reduced heart rate.\n- There were no episodes of severe hypotension after the infusion of hypertonic saline 5%.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
