In this type of study, each participant serves as their own control, with one side of their mouth receiving one treatment and the other side receiving a different treatment.\n\n- Fact: The defects in each patient were randomly assigned.\n- Question: How were the treatments assigned to different sides of the each patient's mouth?\n- Answer: The defects on each side of the patient's mouth were randomly assigned a treatment to ensure no bias in the results.\n\n- Fact: Group B was also treated with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM).\n- Question: What was the additional treatment given to Group B apart from the surgical technique?\n- Answer: Along with the surgical technique, Group B was additionally treated with a Type I collagen membrane, also known as NEOMEM.\n\n- Fact: The clinical attachment level was measured at baseline.\n- Question: What other measurements were taken at the start of the study, besides the depth and width of the gum recession?\n- Answer: The clinical attachment level was also measured at the start of the study. Clinical attachment level (CAL) is a measure of the position of the periodontal ligament, which is the tissue that helps to keep the tooth securely in place.\n\n- Fact: The gingival recessions were of Miller's class I and II.\n- Question: What was the severity of the gum recessions treated in the study?\n- Answer: The study treated gingival recessions of Miller's class I and II, which are generally considered mild to moderate. The Miller's Classification is a widely accepted method to categorize and describe the severity of gum recession.\n\n- Fact: The level of significance for the recession depth reduction in both treatments is P < 0.001.\n- Question: Can you elaborate on the statistical significance of the recession depth reduction in both treatments?\n- Answer: The reduction in the depth of the gum recession in both treatments was extremely highly significant with a p-value of less than 0.001. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to be statistically significant, so p < 0.001 means there is a very low probability that the results could have occurred by chance.\n\n- Fact: The level of significance for the greater reduction in Group B is P < 0.01.\n- Question: How statistically significant was the greater reduction of recession depth in Group B compared to Group A?\n- Answer: The greater reduction of recession depth in Group B compared to Group A was highly statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.01 This means there is a very low chance that this difference happened by accident. \n\n- Fact: The level of significance for the probing depth changes in both groups is P < 0.01.\n- Question: How statistically significant were the changes in probing depth in both treatments?\n- Answer: The changes in probing depth, which measures how deep a periodontal probe can be inserted into the pocket between the gum and the tooth, were highly statistically significant in both treatments, with a p-value of less than 0.01.\n\n- Fact: The gain of CAL in Group B was 2.23 \u00b1 0.75 mm.\n- Question: What was the increase in clinical attachment level in Group B?\n- Answer: In Group B, the clinical attachment level, which measures how well the gums are attached to the teeth, increased by 2.23 \u00b1 0.75 mm. \n\n- Fact: The P-value for the gain of CAL in Group B was less than 0.001.\n- Question: How statistically significant was the increase in the clinical attachment level in Group B?\n- Answer: The increase in the clinical attachment level in Group B was highly statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001.\n\n- Fact: A significant gain of CAL was also seen in Group A.\n- Question: Was there any notable increase in the clinical attachment level in Group A?\n- Answer: Yes, there was a significant increase in the clinical attachment level in Group A, reflecting the effectiveness of the surgical technique used in that group.\n\n- Fact: The P-value for the gain of CAL in Group A was less than 0.001.\n- Question: How statistically significant was the increase in the clinical attachment level in Group A?\n- Answer: The increase in the clinical attachment level in Group A was very highly statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001. This means that it is highly unlikely that this result occurred by chance.\n\n- Fact: The P-value for the difference between the gains of CAL in Group A and Group B was less than 0.01.\n- Question: How statistically significant was the difference in clinical attachment level gains between Group A and Group B?\n- Answer: The difference in the gains of clinical attachment level between Group A and Group B was highly statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.01. This indicates a low probability that the observed difference could have happened by accident.\n\n- Fact: The width of keratinized tissue increased in both groups.\n- Question: Besides the recession depth, was there any other improvement observed in both groups?\n- Answer: Yes, another improvement observed in both groups was an increase in the width of keratinized tissue. Keratinized tissue refers to the tougher, protective outer layer of the gums that is resistant to abrasive forces.\n\n- Fact: The increase in the width of keratinized tissue was significant (P < 0.001).\n- Question: How statistically significant was the increase in the width of the keratinized tissue?\n- Answer: The increase in the width of the keratinized tissue, the protective outer layer of the gums, was very highly statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001.\n\n- Fact: The increase in the width of keratinized tissue in group B was 2.30 \u00b1 1.06 mm.\n- Question: What was the increase in the width of the keratinized tissue in Group B?\n- Answer: In Group B, the width of the keratinized tissue increased by 2.30 \u00b1 1.06 mm.\n\n- Fact: The increase in the width of keratinized tissue in group A was 1.21 \u00b1 0.67 mm.\n- Question: What was the increase in the width of the keratinized tissue in Group A?\n- Answer: In Group A, the width of the keratinized tissue increased by 1.21 \u00b1 0.67 mm.\n\n- Fact: The difference in the increase of the width of keratinized tissue between group A and B was significant (P < 0.001).\n- Question: Was the difference in the increase of the width of keratinized tissue between group A and B statistically significant?\n- Answer: Yes, the difference in the increase of the width of keratinized tissue, the protective layer of the gums, between Group A and B was very highly statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001. \n\n- Fact: The envelope type of CAF alone was also used in the study.\n- Question: Can you specify what treatments were used alone in the study?\n- Answer: Along with the combination treatment, the envelope type of coronally advanced flap (CAF), a surgical method for gum recession, was also used alone in the study.\n\n- Fact: The study was focused on producing root coverage in multiple gingival recession defects.\n- Question: What was the primary aim of the treatments in the study?\n- Answer: The primary aim of the treatments in the study was to produce root coverage in multiple areas of gum recession. This means that they aim to reduce the amount of the tooth root that is exposed due to gum recession.\n\n- Fact: The use of the envelope type of CAF along with NEOMEM also resulted in an increase in the width of KT.\n- Question: What was the result of using both the surgical technique and the collagen membrane (NEOMEM) in terms of the width of the keratinized tissue?\n- Answer: The use of both the surgical technique (the envelope type of coronally advanced flap) and the collagen membrane (NEOMEM) resulted in an increase in the width of the keratinized tissue, which is the protective outer layer of the gums."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1435, "completion_tokens": 1791, "total_tokens": 3226}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND.\nThe aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the clinical outcome of the envelope-type of coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone versus envelope type of coronally advanced flap plus type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) in the treatment of multiple buccal gingival recessions, using the split mouth study.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nTen patients in the age group of 20-50 years showing bilateral gingival recessions were treated. The defects in each patient were randomly assigned as Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF, and those in Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM). The recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and width of the keratinized tissue (KT) were measured at baseline, at three and six month intervals.\n\nRESULTS.\nForty-six Miller's class I and II gingival recessions were treated. In the CAF + Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)-treated (Group B) sites the baseline gingival recession was 2.34 \u00b1 0.48 mm, while in the CAFtreated (Group A) sites it was 2.52 \u00b1 0.84 mm. Both the treatments resulted in significant recession depth reduction (P < 0.001), but the reduction was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for Group B than Group A. The probing depth changes were significant (P < 0.01) for both groups, but the difference was nonsignificant. Similarly, a significant gain of CAL was seen in Group B (2.23 \u00b1 0.75 mm, P < 0.001) as well as in group A (1.60 \u00b1 0.86 mm, P < 0.001) showing a significant difference (P < 0.01) between the two groups. The width of keratinized tissue was also significantly (P < 0.001) increased in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in group B (2.30 \u00b1 1.06 mm) than in group A (1.21 \u00b1 0.67 mm).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe envelope type of CAF along with Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) was more effective than envelope type of CAF alone, in producing root coverage in multiple gingival recession defects, associated with gain in CAL as also in the width of KT.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at two ways of treating gum recession and compares how effectively they work. One method uses a surgical technique called the envelope-type of coronally advanced flap (CAF) by itself. The other method combines this surgical technique with a collagen membrane (NEOMEM). \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study involved ten people aged between 20 and 50 who had gum recession on both sides of their mouth. Each person's gum recession was split into two groups. Group A was treated using just the surgical technique and Group B used the surgical technique and the collagen membrane. The team measured the depth and width of the gum recession, as well as other factors at the start of the study and after three and six months. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe team treated 46 cases of gum recession during the study. In Group B - where the surgical technique was combined with the collagen membrane - the average original depth of the gum recession was about 2.34mm. In Group A, where only the surgical technique was used, this was roughly 2.52mm. Both treatments effectively reduced the depth of the gum recession, but the reduction was significantly more in Group B. Both treatments also saw significant changes in the other factors that were measured. However, the changes were much more pronounced in Group B.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe combination of the surgical technique and the collagen membrane was more effective at treating gum recession than the surgical technique alone. This combination also led to better results in the gain of gum attachment as well as the width of the keratinized tissue, which is the outer, protective layer of the gums.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The treatments are used for the treatment of multiple buccal gingival recessions.\n- The study uses a split mouth study design.\n- The defects in each patient were randomly assigned.\n- Group B was also treated with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM).\n- The clinical attachment level was measured at baseline.\n- The gingival recessions were of Miller's class I and II.\n- The level of significance for the recession depth reduction in both treatments is P < 0.001.\n- The level of significance for the greater reduction in Group B is P < 0.01.\n- The level of significance for the probing depth changes in both groups is P < 0.01.\n- The gain of CAL in Group B was 2.23 \u00b1 0.75 mm.\n- The P-value for the gain of CAL in Group B was less than 0.001.\n- A significant gain of CAL was also seen in Group A.\n- The P-value for the gain of CAL in Group A was less than 0.001.\n- The P-value for the difference between the gains of CAL in Group A and Group B was less than 0.01.\n- The width of keratinized tissue increased in both groups.\n- The increase in the width of keratinized tissue was significant (P < 0.001).\n- The increase in the width of keratinized tissue in group B was 2.30 \u00b1 1.06 mm.\n- The increase in the width of keratinized tissue in group A was 1.21 \u00b1 0.67 mm.\n- The difference in the increase of the width of keratinized tissue between group A and B was significant (P < 0.001).\n- The envelope type of CAF alone was also used in the study.\n- The study was focused on producing root coverage in multiple gingival recession defects.\n- The use of the envelope type of CAF along with NEOMEM also resulted in an increase in the width of KT.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
