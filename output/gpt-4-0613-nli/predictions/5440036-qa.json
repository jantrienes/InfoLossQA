Eye enucleation is a surgical procedure to remove the eye while leaving the eye muscles and remaining orbital contents intact.\n\n- Fact: PONV is commonly observed after orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery.\n- Question: Apart from eye enucleation, is there another surgery where postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly observed?\n- Answer: Yes, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is also commonly observed after orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery. This surgery involves the implantation of a hydroxyapatite, a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite, into the eye socket.\n\n- Fact: A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted.\n- Question: What kind of trial was conducted in the study?\n- Answer: The study was done through a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. This means the study was planned before the patients underwent treatment (prospective), an assigned treatment was given to the patient randomly (randomized), and neither the patients nor the doctors knew which treatment the patients were receiving (double-blind).\n\n- Fact: The hypothesis also suggests that this combination could achieve similar prophylaxis against PONV after surgery.\n- Question: Apart from reducing the incident of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), what is another potential benefit of using a lower dose of palonosetron in combination with droperidol?\n- Answer: The combination of a lower dose of palonosetron and droperidol could also provide similar prevention (prophylaxis) against PONV after surgery.\n\n- Fact: The patients were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II.\n- Question: What health classifications were the patients in, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists?\n- Answer: The patients in the study were classified as Classes I and II by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. This means they were healthy or had only a mild systemic disease.\n\n- Fact: The patients were scheduled for orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery.\n- Question: Apart from eye enucleation, what other type of eye surgery were the patients in the study scheduled for?\n- Answer: The patients in the study were also scheduled for orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery.\n\n- Fact: Group P2.5 was given 2.5 \u03bcg/kg of palonosetron.\n- Question: What dosage of palonosetron was administered to the patients in the P2.5 group?\n- Answer: The patients in the P2.5 group were given a dosage of 2.5 \u03bcg/kg of palonosetron.\n\n- Fact: Group P7.5 was given 7.5 \u03bcg/kg of palonosetron.\n- Question: How much palonosetron did the patients in the P7.5 group receive?\n- Answer: The P7.5 group of patients were given 7.5 \u03bcg/kg of palonosetron.\n\n- Fact: Group P+D was also given 15 \u03bcg/kg of droperidol.\n- Question: Apart from palonosetron, did the group P+D receive any other drug and what was its dosage?\n- Answer: Yes, in addition to palonosetron, the patients in the P+D group were also given 15 \u03bcg/kg of droperidol.\n\n- Fact: The antiemetic regimens were administered intravenously.\n- Question: How were the treatments to prevent vomiting (antiemetic regimens) given to the patients?\n- Answer: The treatments to prevent vomiting (antiemetic regimens) were given to the patients through an intravenous injection, that is, directly into their veins.\n\n- Fact: The antiemetic regimens were administered 5 minutes before surgery.\n- Question: When were the treatments to prevent vomiting (antiemetic regimens) given to the patients?\n- Answer: The treatments were administered to the patients 5 minutes before they underwent surgery. \n\n- Fact: Group P2.5 had a nausea score.\n- Question: Did the patients in Group P2.5 have a measured level of nausea?\n- Answer: Yes, the level of nausea experienced by the patients in Group P2.5 was measured and recorded as a score.\n\n- Fact: The nausea score of Group P2.5 was evaluated at 0\u20134 h and 24\u201348 h.\n- Question: At which time intervals was the intensity of nausea evaluated in Group P2.5?\n- Answer: The intensity of nausea in Group P2.5 was evaluated at two intervals: 0\u20134 hours and 24\u201348 hours after surgery.\n\n- Fact: The difference in nausea scores was statistically significant (P<0.05).\n- Question: Were the differences in the levels of nausea experienced by the different groups significant?\n- Answer: Yes, the differences in the nausea levels experienced by the different treatment groups were statistically significant with a P-value less than 0.05. This means the difference is not due to chance.\n\n- Fact: The difference in vomiting scores among the groups was not statistically significant.\n- Question: Were the differences in vomiting levels among the different groups significant?\n- Answer: No, the differences in vomiting levels among the different patient groups were not statistically significant, which means that these differences could simply be due to chance and not due to the treatment.\n\n- Fact: The difference in CR rates between the groups was statistically significant (P<0.05).\n- Question: Was there a significant difference in the rate at which patients completely responded to treatment (CR rate) among the different treatment groups?\n- Answer: Yes, the difference in the rate at which patients completely responded to treatment (CR rate) among the different treatment groups was statistically significant, with a P-value less than 0.05.\n\n- Fact: In Group P2.5, 49% of patients did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study.\n- Question: What percentage of patients in Group P2.5 did not experience any nausea or vomiting at all throughout the study? \n- Answer: In Group P2.5, 49% of patients did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study.\n\n- Fact: In Group P7.5, 67% of patients did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study.\n- Question: How many patients in Group P7.5 were completely free of nausea and vomiting throughout the study? \n- Answer: In Group P7.5, 67% of the patients did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study.\n\n- Fact: The difference in the percentage of patients who did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study among the three groups is statistically significant (P<0.01).\n- Question: Was there a significant difference among the treatment groups in the proportion of patients who did not experience any nausea or vomiting?\n- Answer: Yes, the difference in the percentage of patients who did not experience any nausea or vomiting among the three treatment groups was statistically significant with a P-value less than 0.01. \n\n- Fact: The combination potentiated prophylaxis for PONV.\n- Question: What effect did combining a low dose of palonosetron with droperidol have on preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)?\n- Answer: Combining a low dose of palonosetron with droperidol enhanced the prevention (potentiated prophylaxis) of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).\n\n- Fact: Palonosetron is used in higher doses for prophylaxis.\n- Question: Is palonosetron ever used in higher doses and, if so, for what purpose?\n- Answer: Yes, palonosetron is used in higher doses for the purpose of preventing (prophylaxis) postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1428, "completion_tokens": 1686, "total_tokens": 3114}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nOBJECTIVE.\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly observed after eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery. This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that compared with monotherapy using a higher dose of palonosetron, using a lower dose of palonosetron in combination with droperidol could reduce the incidence of PONV and achieve similar prophylaxis against PONV after the aforementioned surgery.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nA total of 129 patients who were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II, aged between 18 and 70 years, and scheduled for eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery, were enrolled in this study. They were randomized into three groups: Group P2.5 (2.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron), Group P7.5 (7.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron), and Group P+D (2.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron and 15 \u03bcg/kg droperidol). Patients received the different antiemetic regimens intravenously 5 min before surgery. The severity of nausea and vomiting and the complete response (CR) rate during a 72-h postoperative period were assessed.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll patients completed the trial. The nausea score of Group P2.5 was significantly higher than those of the other two groups at 0\u20134 h and 24\u201348 h (P<0.05). Vomiting scores among all groups were similar during all intervals (P>0.05). Compared with Group P2.5, the CR rate was significantly improved at all intervals in Group P+D, except at 4\u201372 h, and was also elevated at 24\u201372 h in Group P7.5 (P<0.05). Fewer patients in Group P2.5 did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study (49%) compared with those in Group P7.5 (67%) and Group P+D (81%; P<0.01).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nCombining low-dose palonosetron with droperidol potentiated prophylaxis for PONV and achieved a similar prophylactic effect as that with a higher dose of palonosetron.\n\n## Simplification\nOBJECTIVE:\nThis study investigates if combining a low dose of the drug palonosetron with another drug called droperidol can help to reduce sickness (nausea and vomiting) experienced after a certain eye surgery, compared to using a higher dose of palonosetron alone. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nThis trial involved 129 adults, aged 18 to 70, that are categorised as healthy or having mild illness by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. They were going to have eye and orbital implant surgery. These patients were divided into three groups and each group received different anti-sickness treatments just before their surgery. Their levels of nausea, vomiting, and overall response to treatment were assessed for 72 hours after surgery. \n\nRESULTS:\nAll involved patients finished the study. The group receiving a low dose of palonosetron had more severe nausea than the other two groups at 0-4 and 24-48 hours after surgery. Vomiting levels were similar across all the groups. The complete response (no nausea or vomiting) rate was better in the group receiving a low-dose of palonosetron and droperidol than in the low dose palonosetron alone group, except at 4-72 hours, and was also better at 24-72 hours in the high dose palonosetron group. Less than half (49%) of the patients in the low dose palonosetron alone group didn't experience any sickness, compared to 67% in the high dose group and 81% in the combined treatment group.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nCombining a low dose of palonosetron with droperidol was better at preventing post-surgery sickness and produced similar results to using a high dose of palonosetron alone.\n\n## Missing facts\n- PONV is commonly observed after eye enucleation.\n- PONV is commonly observed after orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery.\n- A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted.\n- The hypothesis also suggests that this combination could achieve similar prophylaxis against PONV after surgery.\n- The patients were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II.\n- The patients were scheduled for orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery.\n- Group P2.5 was given 2.5 \u03bcg/kg of palonosetron.\n- Group P7.5 was given 7.5 \u03bcg/kg of palonosetron.\n- Group P+D was also given 15 \u03bcg/kg of droperidol.\n- The antiemetic regimens were administered intravenously.\n- The antiemetic regimens were administered 5 minutes before surgery.\n- Group P2.5 had a nausea score.\n- The nausea score of Group P2.5 was evaluated at 0\u20134 h and 24\u201348 h.\n- The difference in nausea scores was statistically significant (P<0.05).\n- The difference in vomiting scores among the groups was not statistically significant.\n- The difference in CR rates between the groups was statistically significant (P<0.05).\n- In Group P2.5, 49% of patients did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study.\n- In Group P7.5, 67% of patients did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study.\n- The difference in the percentage of patients who did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study among the three groups is statistically significant (P<0.01).\n- The combination potentiated prophylaxis for PONV.\n- Palonosetron is used in higher doses for prophylaxis.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
