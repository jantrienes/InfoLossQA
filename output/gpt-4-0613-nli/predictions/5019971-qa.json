This protein plays an important role in HIV infection as it allows the virus to enter the cells. By blocking it, Maraviroc helps in preventing the spread of HIV within the body.\n\n- Fact: Maraviroc has been shown to decrease monocyte infiltration.\n- Question: Does Maraviroc have any effect on the cells involved in immune response?\n- Answer: Yes, Maraviroc has been shown to lower the presence of monocytes, which are cells that play a key role in the immune system's response to infections.\n\n- Fact: The decrease in immune activation and monocyte infiltration was observed in atherosclerotic plaques.\n- Question: Overall, where was the decrease in immune activation and monocyte presence observed in this study? \n- Answer: The researchers observed that Maraviroc was effective in decreasing immune activation and monocyte presence specifically in atherosclerotic plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques are clumps of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in our blood that can build up in the arteries, causing them to harden and become narrow, a condition known as atherosclerosis.\n\n- Fact: The effects of Maraviroc were studied in the context of atherosclerosis.\n- Question: What was the specific medical condition the researchers were looking at when trying to understand Maraviroc's effects?\n- Answer: The scientists were studying atherosclerosis, which is a disease where plaque builds up inside your arteries, leading to heart-related issues. \n\n- Fact: The study focused on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).\n- Question: What was the major measurement the researchers focused on in this study?\n- Answer: The researchers focused on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). FMD is a measure of the ability of an artery to relax and open up wider (dilate) in response to increased blood flow. It's a way of assessing the health of blood vessels and can provide an indication of cardiovascular risk.\n\n- Fact: The study is open-label.\n- Question: Was the study blind or open-label?\n- Answer: This study was open-label, which means both the researchers and the patients knew which treatment was being administered.\n\n- Fact: The control period involves an unchanged cART regimen.\n- Question: What did the control period of the study entail in terms of the patients' treatment?\n- Answer: During the control period of the study, the patients stayed on their normal combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen without any changes. cART is the standard treatment for HIV.\n\n- Fact: Expression of HIV co-receptors was measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16.\n- Question: Did the researchers monitor anything related to how HIV enters cells?\n- Answer: Yes, they measured the expression of HIV co-receptors. These are proteins on the surface of immune cells that enable HIV to enter and infect the cells. The expression of these co-receptors was measured at the start, middle and end of the study.\n\n- Fact: Markers of coagulation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16.\n- Question: Did the researchers measure anything related to blood clotting over the course of the study?\n- Answer: Yes, the researchers measured markers of coagulation, which relates to the ability of blood to form clots. These measures were taken at the start, middle and end of the study.\n\n- Fact: Cellular markers of immune activation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16.\n- Question: Did the researchers check for any indicators of immune system activity?\n- Answer: Yes, they measured certain cellular markers that indicate immune system activation. They performed these measurements at the beginning, halfway point, and end of the study.\n\n- Fact: Non-parametric tests were used for the comparison.\n- Question: What type of statistical methods did the researchers use for the analysis?\n- Answer: The researchers used non-parametric tests for their analysis. These are a type of statistical tests that do not assume that the data follow a specific distribution.\n\n- Fact: The relation involves a change in FMD.\n- Question: What specific relation were the researchers studying?\n- Answer: The relation being studied was the change in flow-mediated dilation (FMD), which is a measure of blood vessel health, in relation to other factors like inflammation and immune activation.\n\n- Fact: Linear regression modeling is being used for the evaluation.\n- Question: What statistical method did the researchers use to study the relationship between different variables?\n- Answer: The researchers used linear regression modeling. This is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n\n- Fact: These patients have suppressed plasma HIV-RNA.\n- Question: What is the HIV condition of the patient in the study?\n- Answer: The patients in this study had suppressed plasma HIV-RNA. This means the level of HIV in their blood was low, typically as a result of effective HIV treatment.\n\n- Fact: FMD increased by 0.73% after maraviroc intensification.\n- Question: By how much did the blood vessel function (FMD) improve after the extra Maraviroc was added?\n- Answer: The flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), which measures blood vessel function, increased by 0.73% after additional Maraviroc was given.\n\n- Fact: The interquartile range (IQR) of the FMD increase after maraviroc intensification was -0.25 to 1.70.\n- Question: What was the variation in FMD improvement after Maraviroc intensification?\n- Answer: The variation in FMD improvement, or the interquartile range (IQR), was between -0.25 and 1.70. The IQR is a measure of statistical spread - it is the range within which the central half of the measurements fall.\n\n- Fact: FMD decreased by -0.42% in the control period.\n- Question: How did the blood vessel function change in the control period, when patients were not given extra Maraviroc?\n- Answer: In the control period where patients did not receive additional Maraviroc, the FMD, an assessment of blood vessel health, actually decreased by -0.42%.\n\n- Fact: The interquartile range (IQR) of the FMD decrease in the control period was -1.89 to 0.25.\n- Question: What was the variation in FMD decrease during the control stage of the study?\n- Answer: The variation in FMD decrease, or the interquartile range (IQR), during the control stage was between -1.89 and 0.25. \n\n- Fact: The difference in FMD changes between the maraviroc intensification and the control period was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.049.\n- Question: Was the difference in blood vessel function between the Maraviroc intensification and control periods significant?\n- Answer: Yes, the difference was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.049. In research, a p-value less than 0.05 usually indicates that the difference is not due to chance.\n\n- Fact: There was a negative relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer.\n- Question: Was there any relationship found between changes in blood vessel health and inflammation?\n- Answer: Yes, the researchers found a negative relation between changes in FMD and \u0394D-dimer. D-dimers are a type of protein fragment produced when a blood clot dissolves in the body, often used as a marker of inflammation and blood clot formation.\n\n- Fact: The \u03b2 value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer was -22.70.\n- Question: What was the exact value of the relationship between changes in blood vessel function and inflammation?\n- Answer: The \u03b2 coefficient, which measures how much one variable changes when another changes by one unit, was -22.70 in the relation between FMD and D-dimer level changes. \n\n- Fact: The 95% confidence interval for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer was -39.27 to -6.13.\n- Question: What was the range in which we can be 95% certain that the true value of the relationship between changes in blood vessel function and inflammation lies?\n- Answer: The 95% confidence interval for the relationship was from -39.27 to -6.13. Confidence intervals give an estimated range of values which is likely to include the true value of the effect.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer was 0.011.\n- Question: How confident can we be that the relationship between changes in blood vessel health and inflammation is not due to chance?\n- Answer: The p-value for the relationship was 0.011. A p-value below 0.05 generally indicates that the observed relationship is unlikely to be due to chance, so we can be fairly confident about this relationship.\n\n- Fact: There was a negative relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells.\n- Question: Did the study find any relationship between changes in blood vessel function and changes in some immune response cells?\n- Answer: Yes, the study showed a negative relation between changes in FMD and changes in a certain type of immune response cells - CD95+ CD4+ T cells. These are a type of white blood cells that are critical to immune response.\n\n- Fact: The \u03b2 value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells was -0.16.\n- Question: What was the numerical relationship between changes in blood vessel health and changes in these immune cells?\n- Answer: The \u03b2 coefficient, or numerical size of the relationship, between changes in blood vessel health (FMD) and changes in CD95+ CD4+ T cells was -0.16.\n\n- Fact: The 95% confidence interval for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells was -0.28 to -0.04.\n- Question: What range did the researchers decide was likely to contain the true value of the relationship between changes in blood vessel function and immune cells?\n- Answer: The 95% confidence interval for that relationship was from -0.28 to -0.04. This means they were 95% confident that the true value of the relationship was within this range.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells was 0.013.\n- Question: How confident were the researchers that the relationship between blood vessel health and immune cells is not due to chance?\n- Answer: The p-value for the relationship was 0.013. A p-value smaller than 0.05 generally suggests the result was statistically significant, i.e., very likely not due to random chance.\n\n- Fact: The relations were adjusted for age and duration of HIV.\n- Question: Did the researchers control for any other factors when studying these relationships?\n- Answer: Yes, the relations were adjusted for age and duration of HIV. That means they made statistical adjustments to ensure observed relationships were not simply due to differences in age or the length of time the patients had been living with HIV.\n\n- Fact: Maraviroc is used to intensify treatment in HIV-infected patients.\n- Question: How is Maraviroc used in treating HIV patients?\n- Answer: Maraviroc is used to intensify the treatment of HIV-infected patients, meaning it can be added to existing HIV medication regimens to improve their effectiveness.\n\n- Fact: Maraviroc intensification has an effect on endothelial function.\n- Question: Does the additional Maraviroc affect anything related to the lining of the blood vessels?\n- Answer: Yes, the researchers found that adding Maraviroc (termed 'Maraviroc intensification') has an effect on endothelial function. The endothelium is the inner lining of the blood vessels, and its health is crucial for overall cardiovascular health.\n\n- Fact: The online version of the article has a DOI number: 10.1007/s40121-016-0115-0.\n- Question: Is there a unique identifier for the online version of this article?\n- Answer: Yes, the online article has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) number, which is 10.1007/s40121-016-0115-0.

Maraviroc, a CCR5 blocker, has been shown to decrease immune activation and monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques in murine experiments. Therefore, we examined the effect of maraviroc intensification on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in abacavir-treated HIV-infected patients and its effect on immunological and inflammatory parameters.\n\nMETHODS.\nA open-label prospective crossover study with a duration of 16 weeks: 8 weeks of intervention (maraviroc intensification) and 8 weeks of control (unchanged cART regimen). FMD, HIV-specific variables, expression of HIV co-receptors, markers of inflammation and coagulation and cellular markers of immune activation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16. The changes (\u0394) in these variables were compared between intervention and control periods using non-parametric tests. To evaluate the relation with the change in FMD, linear regression modeling was used.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-one male patients with suppressed plasma HIV-RNA, on cART, had a known HIV infection for 9.2 years (IQR 6.9\u201313.5) with abacavir use for 6.5 years (2.8\u20139.3). A significantly increased FMD of 0.73% (IQR \u22120.25 to 1.70) was seen after maraviroc intensification compared to a decrease of \u22120.42% (IQR \u22121.89 to 0.25; p = 0.049) in the control period. There was a negative relation between \u0394FMD with \u0394D-dimer (\u03b2 \u221222.70, 95% CI \u221239.27; \u22126.13, p = 0.011) and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells (\u03b2 \u22120.16, 95% CI \u22120.28; \u22120.04, p = 0.013), adjusted for age and duration of HIV.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nMaraviroc intensification modestly improves endothelial function in HIV-infected patients on an abacavir-containing regimen.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT01389063.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40121-016-0115-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis is a study on the drug Maraviroc and its effects on HIV patients who are also taking the drug Abacavir, which some believe may increase their risk of heart disease. Maraviroc is known to decrease immune activation and inflammation in mouse experiments, so we wanted to see if it has similar effects in HIV patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a study for 16 weeks, with half of that time the patients were given extra Maraviroc in addition to their regular HIV medication, and the other half they didn't change anything in their treatment. We tested a range of health markers at the start, halfway and end of the study. We then compared the results from when the patients were given extra Maraviroc and when they weren't.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe study was carried out in 21 male patients who had been living with HIV for an average of 9.2 years and were taking Abacavir for an average of 6.5 years. We found that Maraviroc improved blood flow which is beneficial for heart health. Also, there was a negative relationship between improvements in blood flow and inflammation, as well as immune activation, which suggests Maraviroc might be protecting against inflammation and immune activation.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdding Maraviroc modestly improves blood flow in HIV patients on Abacavir.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT01389063.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nFor those with access, there's additional information available online related to this study.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Maraviroc is a CCR5 blocker.\n- Maraviroc has been shown to decrease monocyte infiltration.\n- The decrease in immune activation and monocyte infiltration was observed in atherosclerotic plaques.\n- The effects of Maraviroc were studied in the context of atherosclerosis.\n- The study focused on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).\n- The study is open-label.\n- The control period involves an unchanged cART regimen.\n- Expression of HIV co-receptors was measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16.\n- Markers of coagulation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16.\n- Cellular markers of immune activation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16.\n- Non-parametric tests were used for the comparison.\n- The relation involves a change in FMD.\n- Linear regression modeling is being used for the evaluation.\n- These patients have suppressed plasma HIV-RNA.\n- FMD increased by 0.73% after maraviroc intensification.\n- The interquartile range (IQR) of the FMD increase after maraviroc intensification was -0.25 to 1.70.\n- FMD decreased by -0.42% in the control period.\n- The interquartile range (IQR) of the FMD decrease in the control period was -1.89 to 0.25.\n- The difference in FMD changes between the maraviroc intensification and the control period was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.049.\n- There was a negative relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer.\n- The \u03b2 value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer was -22.70.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer was -39.27 to -6.13.\n- The p-value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394D-dimer was 0.011.\n- There was a negative relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells.\n- The \u03b2 value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells was -0.16.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells was -0.28 to -0.04.\n- The p-value for the relation between \u0394FMD and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells was 0.013.\n- The relations were adjusted for age and duration of HIV.\n- Maraviroc is used to intensify treatment in HIV-infected patients.\n- Maraviroc intensification has an effect on endothelial function.\n- The online version of the article has a DOI number: 10.1007/s40121-016-0115-0.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
