Patients who maintained clinical stability for \u2a7e12 weeks were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or lurasidone (40\u201380 mg/d, flexibly dosed) for an additional 28-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to relapse (based on Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis).\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 676 patients enrolled in the open-label phase; 285 met protocol-specified stabilization criteria and were randomized to lurasidone (N=144) or placebo (N=141). During the open-label phase, mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score decreased from 90.1 to 54.4 in patients who met clinical stability criteria and were randomized. In the double-blind phase, lurasidone significantly delayed time to relapse compared with placebo (log-rank test, p=0.039), reflecting a 33.7% reduction in risk of relapse (Cox hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.663 (0.447\u20130.983); p=0.041). Probability of relapse at the double-blind week 28 endpoint (based on Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis) was 42.2% in the lurasidone group and 51.2% in the placebo group. Minimal changes in weight, lipid, glucose, and prolactin were observed throughout the study.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study demonstrated the efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL:\nWe wanted to see how well lurasidone works as a long-term treatment for schizophrenia.\n\nMETHOD:\nWe first gave adults with a severe episode of schizophrenia a 12-24 week treatment with lurasidone. After 12 weeks, those who showed improvement were then divided into two groups. One group continued using lurasidone and the other group was given a placebo (a substance with no medical effect) for an additional 28 weeks. We then checked the time it took before their symptoms came back.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe had 676 patients in the first phase and 285 showed improvement. These were then divided into the lurasidone (144 patients) and placebo (141 patients) groups. During the first phase, there was a decrease in the severity of symptoms in those who showed improvement. In the next phase, patients using lurasidone took longer before their symptoms came back compared to the placebo group. This was a 33.7% reduction in the risk of symptoms coming back. At the end of the 28 weeks, 42.2% of the lurasidone group and 51.2% of the placebo group had their symptoms return. During the study, the patients only had minor changes in weight, fat levels, sugar levels, and hormone levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study, which involved multiple treatment centers and used a placebo control group, showed that lurasidone works well in keeping schizophrenia symptoms from returning.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The dosage of lurasidone was 40-80 mg/d.\n- The dosage of lurasidone was flexibly dosed.\n- The treatment with lurasidone was open-label.\n- After maintaining clinical stability, patients were randomized.\n- The randomization process was done in a double-blind fashion.\n- The dosage of lurasidone was between 40 to 80 mg per day.\n- The dosage of lurasidone was flexibly dosed.\n- Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for the measurement.\n- A total of 676 patients enrolled in the open-label phase.\n- 285 patients met protocol-specified stabilization criteria.\n- The study had an open-label phase.\n- The mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score was initially 90.1.\n- The mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score decreased to 54.4.\n- The decrease in score occurred in patients who met clinical stability criteria.\n- The patients who met clinical stability criteria were randomized.\n- The study involved a double-blind phase.\n- The significance of the delay was determined using a log-rank test.\n- The p-value from the log-rank test was 0.039.\n- The Cox hazard ratio was used to measure the reduction in risk of relapse.\n- The Cox hazard ratio was 0.663.\n- The measurement was based on Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis.\n- The study observed changes in lipid levels.\n- The study observed changes in glucose levels.\n- The study observed changes in prolactin levels.\n- The changes in prolactin levels throughout the study were minimal.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
