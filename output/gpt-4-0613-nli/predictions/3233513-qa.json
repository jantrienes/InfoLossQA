This means it is a drug that relaxes the muscles in the airways, helping to open them up and make it easier for a person to breathe.\n\n- Fact: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study.\n- Question: Can you describe the nature of the study?\n- Answer: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study. This means that neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was receiving the real drug or placebo, they grouped the patient's separate treatment pathways, or 'parallel groups', from several countries, and this was a phase III trial, which is typically the last and largest stage of testing new drugs before they\u2019re approved for general use.\n\n- Fact: The patients were randomized to receive either inhaled formoterol or a placebo.\n- Question: How were the patients split into different treatment groups?\n- Answer: The patients were divided randomly into different groups. Some patients took inhaled formoterol and rest were given a placebo or two various doses of the drug. \n\n- Fact: The dosages of inhaled formoterol were either 4.5 or 9 \u03bcg.\n- Question: What were the doses in which Formoterol was given to the patients?\n- Answer: Patients who were given formoterol received the medication in doses of either 4.5 or 9 micrograms (\u03bcg), twice a day.\n\n- Fact: The medication was administered via a Turbuhaler\u00ae.\n- Question: How was the medication given to the patients?\n- Answer: The medication, formoterol, was given to the patients using an inhaler called a Turbuhaler\u00ae.\n\n- Fact: Salbutamol 100 \u03bcg/actuation is used as a medication.\n- Question: Beside Formoterol, was there any other medication used in the study? \n- Answer: Yes, Salbutamol was also used in the study. It was given at a dose of 100 micrograms per actuation.\n\n- Fact: The medication is administered via pMDI.\n- Question: How was the Salbutamol medication administered to the patients?\n- Answer: The Salbutamol medication was administered using a device called a Pressurized Metered-Dose Inhaler, or pMDI.\n\n- Fact: The use of Salbutamol 100 \u03bcg/actuation via pMDI is permitted.\n- Question:  Was the use of Salbutamol allowed during the conduct of the study?\n- Answer: Yes, Salbutamol was permitted as a reliever medication during the study.\n\n- Fact: The change is measured in terms of ratio.\n- Question: How was the change in the patients' breathing ability measured?\n- Answer: The change was measured as a ratio comparing the patient's breathing ability at the end of the treatment period to their baseline, or starting point.\n\n- Fact: The change is related to FEV1.\n- Question: Was the change related to any specific lung function test?\n- Answer: Yes, the change was related to a lung function test called Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, or FEV1. This test measures the amount of air a person can forcefully exhale in one second.\n\n- Fact: The FEV1 is measured 60-min post-dose.\n- Question: How long after the dosage was given was the FEV1 measured?\n- Answer: The FEV1 test was done 60 minutes after each dose of the medication was given.\n\n- Fact: 206 patients received a treatment of formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg.\n- Question: How many patients in the study received the 4.5 \u03bcg dose of Formoterol?\n- Answer: A total of 206 patients received the 4.5 \u03bcg dose of Formoterol.\n\n- Fact: 199 patients received a treatment of formoterol 9 \u03bcg.\n- Question: How many patients in the study received the 9 \u03bcg dose of Formoterol?\n- Answer: As many as 199 patients received the 9 \u03bcg dose of Formoterol.\n\n- Fact: 208 patients received a placebo treatment.\n- Question: How many patients received a placebo instead of the actual drug in the study?\n- Answer: Out of the total patients, 208 of them received a placebo instead of the actual medication."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1728, "completion_tokens": 950, "total_tokens": 2678}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the long-acting \u03b22-agonist formoterol in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study randomized patients \u2265 40 years of age with moderate-to-severe COPD to inhaled formoterol 4.5 or 9 \u03bcg twice daily (bid) via Turbuhaler\u00ae or placebo for 12 weeks. Salbutamol 100 \u03bcg/actuation via pMDI was permitted as reliever medication. The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to treatment period in FEV1 60-min post-dose.\n\nRESULTS.\n613 patients received treatment (formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg n = 206; 9 \u03bcg n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) male; 324 (52.9%) Japanese and 289 (47.1%) European. End of study increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose were significantly greater (p < 0.001 for both) with formoterol 4.5 and 9 \u03bcg bid (113% of baseline for both) than with placebo, as were all secondary outcome measures. The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of \u2265 4 was 50.2% for formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg (p = 0.0682 vs. placebo), 59.2% (p = 0.0004) for 9 \u03bcg, and 41.3% for placebo. Reduction in reliever medication use was significantly greater with formoterol vs. placebo (9 \u03bcg: -0.548, p < 0.001; 4.5 \u03bcg: -0.274, p = 0.027), with 9 \u03bcg being significantly superior to 4.5 \u03bcg (-0.274, p = 0.029). Formoterol was well tolerated with the incidence and type of adverse events not being different for the three groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFormoterol 4.5 \u03bcg and 9 \u03bcg bid was effective and well tolerated in patients with COPD; there was no difference between formoterol doses for the primary endpoint; however, an added value of formoterol 9 \u03bcg over 4.5 \u03bcg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT00628862 (ClinicalTrials.gov); D5122C00001 (AstraZeneca Study code).\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nA study was carried out to see how safe and effective the drug formoterol is for patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard for a person to breathe. \n\nMETHODS.\nThis tested the drug on patients aged 40 years and over across multiple countries. The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. \n\nRESULTS.\n613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo. They also reduced the reliever medication use a lot more than those taking placebo. The drug formoterol was well accepted and the side effects were not significantly different in any of the groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study found that formoterol is effective and safe for COPD patients. Two doses of the drug were tested and although both were helpful, the higher dose seemed to have more benefits for some patients.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study was registered under the numbers NCT00628862 on ClinicalTrials.gov and D5122C00001 as AstraZeneca's study code.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Formoterol is a long-acting \u03b22-agonist.\n- The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study.\n- The patients were randomized to receive either inhaled formoterol or a placebo.\n- The dosages of inhaled formoterol were either 4.5 or 9 \u03bcg.\n- The medication was administered via a Turbuhaler\u00ae.\n- Salbutamol 100 \u03bcg/actuation is used as a medication.\n- The medication is administered via pMDI.\n- The use of Salbutamol 100 \u03bcg/actuation via pMDI is permitted.\n- The change is measured in terms of ratio.\n- The change is related to FEV1.\n- The FEV1 is measured 60-min post-dose.\n- 206 patients received a treatment of formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg.\n- 199 patients received a treatment of formoterol 9 \u03bcg.\n- 208 patients received a placebo treatment.\n- 324 patients were Japanese.\n- 289 patients were European.\n- The study observed increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose.\n- The increases in FEV1 were significantly greater with formoterol 4.5 and 9 \u03bcg bid.\n- The statistical significance of the increase in FEV1 with formoterol was p < 0.001 for both doses.\n- The increase in FEV1 with formoterol was 113% of baseline for both doses.\n- The increase in FEV1 with formoterol was significantly greater than with placebo.\n- All secondary outcome measures were also significantly greater with formoterol than with placebo.\n- The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of \u2265 4 was 50.2%.\n- These patients were treated with formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg.\n- The p-value when comparing this proportion to another group or standard was 0.0682.\n- The percentage for placebo is 41.3%.\n- The p-value for 9 \u03bcg is 0.0004.\n- The reduction was compared with another unspecified treatment or condition.\n- The placebo at 9 \u03bcg has a value of -0.548.\n- The p-value for the placebo at 9 \u03bcg is less than 0.001.\n- The placebo at 4.5 \u03bcg has a value of -0.274.\n- The p-value for the placebo at 4.5 \u03bcg is 0.027.\n- 9 \u03bcg is significantly superior to 4.5 \u03bcg.\n- The p-value for the superiority of 9 \u03bcg over 4.5 \u03bcg is 0.029.\n- Formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg bid was effective in patients with COPD.\n- Formoterol 9 \u03bcg bid was effective in patients with COPD.\n- Formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg bid was well tolerated in patients with COPD.\n- Formoterol 9 \u03bcg bid was well tolerated in patients with COPD.\n- An added value of formoterol 9 \u03bcg over 4.5 \u03bcg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
