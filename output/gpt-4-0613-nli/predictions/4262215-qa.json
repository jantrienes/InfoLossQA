During the treatment, patients in the study group received mental clinical nursing pathway care, while those in the control group were given the usual nursing care, such as timely inspection, nurse's reactions to patient's behavior, and execution of medical orders. Thereafter, the \"self-rating idea of suicide scale\" and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) were used to compare the differences in the suicidal ideation of patients with malignant tumors between the two groups before and after the treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no statistical differences in the scores of despair factor, optimistic factor, sleep factor, and cover factor between the two groups before the treatment (P>0.05). After different styles of nursing, the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the score of cover factor between the two groups (P>0.05). The KPS of patients receiving mental clinical nursing pathway care was higher than those receiving usual nursing care, and there was a statistical significant difference between the two groups (P<0.01). Interestingly, the patients' suicidal ideation scale was negatively correlated with KPS (r =\u22120.29, P<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor individuals diagnosed with a malignant tumor, using a mental health clinical nursing pathway can effectively decrease the degree of suicidal ideation and positively impact the quality of life.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was made to look into how special mental health nursing plans can help reduce thoughts of suicide and improve life quality in patients suffering from serious cancer types.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo groups of 100 serious cancer patients each were formed - one was the study group and the other was the control group. Patients in the study group were given special mental health nursing care, while those in the control group received normal nursing care. After this, we used two tools - a 'self-rating suicide thoughts scale' and a method to assess physical and mental abilities (Karnofsky Performance Status/KPS), to see the change in suicidal thoughts among the cancer patients in the two groups, before and after the treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the different nursing styles were given, the two groups didn't really differ on the factors of despair, optimism, sleep, and hiding their feelings. After the special nursing, patients from the study group showed lower levels in these areas than the control group, except for hiding their feelings where there was no big difference. Patients who did receive the special mental health nursing showed higher physical and mental abilities (KPS), and there was a clear difference between the two groups. Additionally, the more the physical and mental abilities increased, the less the suicide thoughts occurred.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor patients diagnosed with a serious type of cancer, following a special mental health nursing plan can significantly lessen thoughts of suicide and greatly improve their quality of life.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study also aims to understand the relationship between mental clinical nursing pathways and the life quality of patients.\n- There are two hundred patients with malignant tumors.\n- The patients were randomly divided.\n- Usual nursing care includes timely inspection.\n- Usual nursing care includes nurse's reactions to patient's behavior.\n- The difference in the score of the cover factor between the two groups is not statistically significant (P>0.05).\n- The correlation between the patients' suicidal ideation scale and KPS is statistically significant (P<0.05).\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
