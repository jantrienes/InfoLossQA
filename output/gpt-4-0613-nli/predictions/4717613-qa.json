In this study, the benefit of preoperative nutritional support was investigated for non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent anatomic resection.\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective study was planned with the approval of our institutional review board. Fifty-eight patients who underwent anatomic resection in our department between January 2014 and December 2014 were randomized. Thirty-one patients were applied a preoperative nutrition program with immune modulating formulae (enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids and nucleotides) for ten days. There were 27 patients in the control group who were fed with only normal diet. Patients who were malnourished, diabetic or who had undergone bronchoplastic procedures or neoadjuvant therapy were excluded from the study. Patients\u2019 baseline serum albumin levels, defined as the serum albumin level before any nutrition program, and the serum albumin levels on the postoperative third day were calculated and recorded with the other data.\n\nRESULTS.\nAnatomic resection was performed by thoracotomy in 20 patients, and 11 patients were operated by videothoracoscopy in the nutrition program group. On the other hand 16 patients were operated by thoracotomy and 11 patients were operated by videothoracoscopy in the control group. In the control group, the patients\u2019 albumin levels decreased to 25.71\u00a0% of the baseline on the postoperative third day, but this reduction was only 14.69\u00a0% for nutrition program group patients and the difference was statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Complications developed in 12 patients (44.4\u00a0%) in the control group compared to 6 patients in the nutrition group (p\u2009=\u20090.049). The mean chest tube drainage time was 6 (1\u201342) days in the control group against 4 (2\u201315) days for the nutrition program group (p\u2009=\u20090.019).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study showed that preoperative nutrition is beneficial in decreasing the complications and chest tube removal time in non-small cell lung cancer patients that were applied anatomic resection with a reduction of 25\u00a0% in the postoperative albumin levels of non-malnourished patients who underwent resection.\n\n## Simplification\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study looked at if eating a protein-rich diet before surgery could help lung cancer patients recover more quickly after surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe got permission to conduct an experiment on 58 lung cancer patients who were about to have surgery at our hospital between January and December 2014. We divided these patients randomly into two groups. The first group, 31 patients, followed a special diet for ten days before their surgery. This diet included specific nutrients known to boost the immune system. The second group, 27 patients, ate their regular meals. We didn\u2019t include patients who were already not eating well, had diabetes, or had received other treatments for their lung cancer. We measured levels of a protein in their blood before they started the special diet and again three days after their surgery. We also recorded other data, like if they had any problems after the surgery and how long a chest drain needed to stay in after the surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe did the surgery in two different ways in both groups, either opening up the chest or using a video camera to guide the surgery. The patients who didn't have the special diet saw a larger drop in their blood protein levels three days after the surgery. In this group, about 44% of patients had problems after their surgery compared to 19% in the special diet group. Also, the patients in the special diet group had their chest drain removed quicker after the surgery.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study showed that eating a special diet before surgery can help lung cancer patients recover faster and have fewer problems after surgery. It also helps to maintain their blood protein levels, which is good for recovery.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Protein-rich nutrition is necessary after surgery.\n- A prospective study was planned.\n- The institutional review board is associated with the same institution as the study.\n- The nutrition plan used an immune modulating formula.\n- The immune modulating formula was enriched with arginine.\n- The immune modulating formula was enriched with omega-3 fatty acids.\n- The immune modulating formula was enriched with nucleotides.\n- The study excluded patients who had undergone bronchoplastic procedures.\n- Patients' baseline serum albumin levels were calculated.\n- The albumin levels were recorded along with other data.\n- The procedure was performed by thoracotomy.\n- There were 16 patients operated by thoracotomy.\n- There were complications developed in 6 patients in the nutrition group.\n- The study focused on non-small cell lung cancer patients.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
