via binding of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Statins increase PCSK9 levels; the effects of nonstatin lipid\u2010lowering therapies are unclear. Every\u20104\u2010weeks dosing of alirocumab may be appropriate for some patients in absence of background statin but is not yet approved.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nLow\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), PCSK9, and alirocumab levels were assessed in subjects (LDL\u2010C >130 mg/dL, n=24/group) after a 4\u2010week run\u2010in taking oral ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or ezetimibe placebo, when alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (days 1, 29, and 57) was added. Maximal mean LDL\u2010C reductions from day \u22121 baseline (prealirocumab) occurred on day 71 in all groups: alirocumab plus placebo, 47.4%; alirocumab plus ezetimibe, 56.6%; and alirocumab plus fenofibrate, 54.3%. LDL\u2010C reductions were sustained through day 85 with alirocumab plus placebo (47.0%); the duration of effect was slightly diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with ezetimibe (49.6%) or fenofibrate combinations (43.2%). Free PCSK9 concentrations were lowest at day 71 in all groups, then increased over time; by day 85, free PCSK9 concentrations were higher, and alirocumab levels lower, with alirocumab plus fenofibrate, and to a lesser extent alirocumab plus ezetimibe, versus alirocumab plus placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAlirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks produced maximal LDL\u2010C reductions of 47% in combination with placebo and 54% to 57% in combination with ezetimibe or fenofibrate. The oral lipid\u2010lowering therapies appear to increase PCSK9 levels, leading to increased alirocumab clearance. Although the duration of effect was modestly diminished with alirocumab plus ezetimibe/fenofibrate versus placebo, the effect was less than observed in trials with background statins, and it would not preclude the use of alirocumab every 4 weeks in patients taking these nonstatin lipid\u2010lowering therapies concomitantly.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study investigates alirocumab, a drug used to lower cholesterol levels in the body. The effect of alirocumab can be influenced by other substances in the body like PCSK9, which can increase when a person is on certain medications like statins. This study examines how alirocumab operates when interacting with other cholesterol-lowering drugs that are not statins. \n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nThe study reported the impact of alirocumab with cholesterol-lowering substances (ezetimibe, fenofibrate) in people with high cholesterol levels. Also, how the effects of alirocumab last was assessed. They gave alirocumab to people for 4 weeks combined with other substances. The results showed that alirocumab helped in reducing cholesterol levels in the body, the decreases lifted over time, particularly when alirocumab was used with fenofibrate and ezetimibe.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOverall, alirocumab was effective in reducing cholesterol when used alone or with other cholesterol-reducing substances. Even though there were slight decreases in the drug's effectiveness over time when used with ezetimibe or fenofibrate, these interactions would still allow for alirocumab to be used every 4 weeks in patients undergoing treatment with these drugs.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Alirocumab undergoes target\u2010mediated clearance.\n- The target for alirocumab's clearance is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).\n- Alirocumab binds to PCSK9 during its clearance process.\n- The effects of nonstatin lipid\u2010lowering therapies are unclear.\n- This dosing schedule may be suitable for some patients.\n- These patients do not take background statin.\n- The every-4-weeks dosing of alirocumab is not yet approved.\n- The subjects had LDL\u2010C levels greater than 130 mg/dL.\n- There were 24 subjects in each group.\n- During the run-in, subjects were taking oral ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or ezetimibe placebo.\n- Alirocumab 150 mg was added every 4 weeks.\n- Alirocumab was added on days 1, 29, and 57.\n- Maximal mean LDL-C reductions from day -1 baseline occurred on day 71.\n- The group treated with alirocumab plus placebo had a 47.4% reduction in LDL-C.\n- The group treated with alirocumab plus ezetimibe had a 56.6% reduction in LDL-C.\n- The group treated with alirocumab plus fenofibrate had a 54.3% reduction in LDL-C.\n- LDL-C reductions were sustained through day 85 with alirocumab plus placebo.\n- The reduction rate with alirocumab plus placebo was 47.0%.\n- The duration of effect was slightly diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with ezetimibe.\n- The reduction rate with ezetimibe was 49.6%.\n- The duration of effect was slightly diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with fenofibrate combinations.\n- The reduction rate with fenofibrate combinations was 43.2%.\n- Free PCSK9 concentrations were lowest at day 71 in all groups.\n- Free PCSK9 concentrations increased over time after day 71.\n- By day 85, free PCSK9 concentrations were higher.\n- Alirocumab levels were lower by day 85.\n- Free PCSK9 concentrations were higher to a lesser extent with alirocumab plus ezetimibe by day 85.\n- Alirocumab levels were lower with alirocumab plus fenofibrate by day 85.\n- Alirocumab levels were lower to a lesser extent with alirocumab plus ezetimibe by day 85.\n- The changes in free PCSK9 concentrations and alirocumab levels were compared against alirocumab plus placebo.\n- Alirocumab 150 mg is administered every 4 weeks.\n- Alirocumab 150 mg combined with placebo resulted in maximal LDL-C reductions of 47%.\n- Alirocumab 150 mg combined with ezetimibe resulted in maximal LDL-C reductions of 54% to 57%.\n- Alirocumab 150 mg combined with fenofibrate resulted in maximal LDL-C reductions of 54% to 57%.\n- Increased PCSK9 levels lead to increased alirocumab clearance.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
