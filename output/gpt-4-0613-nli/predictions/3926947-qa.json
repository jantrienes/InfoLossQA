The aim of this paper was to study whether Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a more effective method than a questionnaire sent by post when following up outpatient treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry. Eighty patients were recruited from a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient unit in Sweden. One parent of each of the patients was randomized to complete the BCFPI follow-up form, using either IVR (n = 40) or postal survey (n = 40) one month after discharge. The response rate for complete answers was 65% in the IVR group and 38% in the postal survey group (p = 0.014). There was less need for reminders in the IVR group (p = 0.000). IVR is a promising and cost-effective method for evaluating evidence-based treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric care.\n\n## Simplification\nThis paper looks at whether using automated phone calls (Interactive Voice Response, or IVR) works better than sending a questionnaire in the mail for keeping track of treatments in child and teen mental health care. The study was carried out in Sweden, with 80 patients from a mental health clinic for children and teenagers. One parent of each patient was asked to fill in a follow-up form about their child's treatment either over the phone or by mail.\n\nOut of these, 65% of those who were asked to use the phone gave complete answers, compared to 38% who got the questionnaire in the mail. Also, fewer reminders were needed for the group using the phone. This suggests that using automated phone calls could be a promising and cost-effective way to keep track of treatments in child and teen mental health care.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Systematic evaluation is important in child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient treatment.\n- Systematic evaluation of child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient treatment is time-consuming.\n- The context of the study is in following up outpatient treatment.\n- The outpatient treatment being studied is in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry.\n- The patients were recruited from a psychiatric outpatient unit.\n- The psychiatric outpatient unit is for children and adolescents.\n- The psychiatric outpatient unit is located in Sweden.\n- One parent of each patient was chosen to complete the BCFPI follow-up form.\n- The BCFPI follow-up form was completed one month after discharge.\n- 40 parents completed the BCFPI follow-up form using IVR.\n- 40 parents completed the BCFPI follow-up form using a postal survey.\n- The difference in response rates between the IVR group and the postal survey group was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.014.\n- The difference in need for reminders in the IVR group was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.000.\n- IVR is a promising method for evaluating evidence-based treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric care.\n- IVR is a cost-effective method for evaluating evidence-based treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric care.\n- The purpose of using IVR is to evaluate evidence-based treatment.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
