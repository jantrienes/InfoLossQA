We evaluated the effects of randomized glycemic control strategy (IS vs. IP) on the prevalence and incidence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nDPN (defined as Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument [MNSI] clinical examination score >2) was assessed at baseline and yearly for 4 years. DPN prevalence and incidence were compared by intention-to-treat modeling by logistic generalized estimating equation models for prevalence and Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models for incidence rates.\n\nRESULTS.\nResults are reported for 2,159 BARI 2D participants (70% males) with valid baseline and at least one follow-up MNSI score (mean age 62 \u00b1 9 years, mean HbA1c 7.7 \u00b1 1.6%, diabetes duration 10 \u00b1 9 years). There were no differences in the prevalence of DPN between the IS and the IP groups throughout the 4 years of follow-up. In 1,075 BARI 2D participants with no DPN at baseline, the 4-year cumulative incidence rate of DPN was significantly lower in the IS (66%) than in the IP (72%) strategy group (P = 0.02), which remained significant after adjusting for the in-trial HbA1c (P = 0.04). In subgroup analyses, IS strategy had a greater benefit in men (hazard ratio 0.75 [99% CI 0.58\u20130.99], P < 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAmong patients with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 4 years during BARI 2D, a glycemic control therapy with IS significantly reduced the incidence of DPN compared with IP therapy and may add further benefit for men.\n\n## Simplification\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe aim of this study was to observe how two different treatments for type 2 diabetes, both affecting how insulin works in your body, can influence the occurrence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition that affects the nerves, causing numbness and pain, mostly in your hands and feet.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nTo find out, the researchers looked at how many people experienced this issue for the first time or already had the problem at the beginning of the study and then checked them over the course of 4 years. For the analysis, they used some advanced statistical methods.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe study involved 2,159 participants (mostly men) with type 2 diabetes. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of how many people had the condition at the start. However, for those that did not have the condition at the beginning of the study, the group that had the insulin-sensitizing treatment showed fewer cases of new onset peripheral neuropathy over 4 years than the group that had the insulin-providing treatment, especially among men. This was independent of their blood glucose control throughout the trial.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe results suggest that in patients with type 2 diabetes, getting the insulin-sensitizing treatment can reduce the chance of developing diabetic peripheral neuropathy than getting the insulin-providing treatment. This could be especially beneficial for men.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial was conducted.\n- The study found similar long-term clinical effectiveness of IS and IP treatments on cardiovascular outcomes.\n- The statement is based on an IP (Intellectual Property).\n- DPN was assessed yearly.\n- The yearly assessment of DPN lasted for 4 years.\n- The comparison was done by intention-to-treat modeling.\n- Logistic generalized estimating equation models were used for prevalence.\n- Kaplan-Meier estimates were used in the comparison.\n- Cox regression models were used for incidence rates.\n- 70% of the BARI 2D participants are males.\n- All reported participants have at least one follow-up MNSI score.\n- The mean age of the participants is 62 years.\n- The standard deviation of the participants' age is 9 years.\n- The mean HbA1c level of the participants is 7.7%.\n- The standard deviation of the participants' HbA1c level is 1.6%.\n- The mean duration of diabetes among the participants is 10 years.\n- There were 1,075 BARI 2D participants with no DPN at baseline.\n- The incidence rate of DPN was lower in the IS strategy group (66%) than in the IP strategy group (72%).\n- The difference in incidence rates between the IS and IP groups was statistically significant (P = 0.02).\n- The significance of the difference in incidence rates remained even after adjusting for the in-trial HbA1c (P = 0.04).\n- Subgroup analyses were conducted on the IS strategy.\n- The IS strategy showed a greater benefit in men.\n- The hazard ratio for men using the IS strategy was 0.75.\n- The 99% confidence interval for the hazard ratio was between 0.58 and 0.99.\n- The P-value for the benefit of the IS strategy in men was less than 0.01.\n- A glycemic control therapy with IS was used on some patients.\n- IP therapy was used on some patients.\n- IS therapy may add further benefit for men.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
