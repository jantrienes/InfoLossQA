LS and SNP combination was administered in 35 patients (study group, SG). In the remaining patients, normal saline solution was given (placebo group, PG). Levosimendan (10\u03bcgr/kg) started 4 h prior to operation and we stopped LS before the initiation of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). During the rewarming period, we started again levosimendan (10\u03bcgr/kg) in combination with SNP (0.1-0.2 \u03bcgr/kg/min). If mean blood pressure decreased by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values, for corrected of mean arterial pressure, the volume loading was performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate. Hemodynamic variables, inotrophyc requirement, and laboratory values were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nFive patients died (7.14%) post-surgery (one from SG and 4 from PG) due to low cardiac out-put syndrome (LOS). At the postoperative period, cardiac output and stroke volume index was higher in SG (mean\u00b1sd;29.1\u00b16.3 vs. 18.4\u00b14.9 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122 (P<0.0001)). Stroke volume index (SVI) decreased from 29\u00b110mL/m2 preoperatively to 22\u00b114mL/m2 in the early postoperative period in group 1. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.002). Cardiac index was higher in SG (320.7\u00b137.5 vs. 283.0\u00b183.9 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122 (P=0.009)). The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6\u00b12.7 vs. 10.4\u00b12.0 mg/kg, P< 0.008), and postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P< 0.01). Ten patients (28.5%) in SG and 21 patients (60%) in PG required inotrophyc support (P<0.001). We used IABP in eight patients (22.8%) in SG and 17 patients (48.5%) in CG (P=0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis study showed that LS and SNP combination impressive increase in left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions including LVEF. The use of this combination achieved more less inotrophics and IABP requirement. We therefore suggest preoperative and peroperative levosimendan and SNP combination.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL:\nOur study wanted to see how the combination of two drugs, levosimendan (LS) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), impacts the heart's ability to pump during and after heart bypass surgery in people who also needed another procedure to fix the inside wall of the heart.\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe had 70 heart disease patients with a type of heart damage that causes it to enlarge. We gave half the patients the drug combination and the other half a harmless salt solution (as a comparison group). The levosimendan was started 4 hours before surgery and stopped before the start of the heart bypass; during the last part of surgery, levosimendan was restarted along with SNP. If a patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during this process, a volume increasing solution was given to correct it. We recorded many patients' blood measurements, their need for heart-strengthening drugs, and laboratory test results.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nAfter surgery, 5 patients died due to heart complications (one from the drug group and four from the comparison group). Patients given the drugs had stronger heart function stats compared to those who weren't. These patients also needed less supportive drugs and less interventional equipment post-surgery. Various measurements like cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac index were better in the drug group. Also, fewer people in the drug group needed help from heart-strengthening drugs or equipment post-surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe study shows that the LS and SNP combination really improved heart function during and after surgery. Using these drugs led to less need for other supporting drugs or equipment. Thus, we suggest using this drug combination before and during surgery.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The effects being studied are on systolic and diastolic ventricular function.\n- The patients in the study required endoventricular patch repair (EVPR).\n- The condition the patients had was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.\n- These 35 patients form a study group.\n- The study group is referred to as SG.\n- There are remaining patients.\n- These remaining patients were given a normal saline solution.\n- The normal saline solution is considered a placebo.\n- The placebo group is referred to as PG.\n- The dosage of Levosimendan was 10\u03bcgr/kg.\n- A rewarming period occurred.\n- Levosimendan was started again during the rewarming period.\n- The dosage of levosimendan used was 10\u03bcgr/kg.\n- The dosage of SNP used was between 0.1-0.2 \u03bcgr/kg/min.\n- The mean blood pressure can decrease by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values.\n- The mean arterial pressure is corrected.\n- Volume loading is performed when the mean blood pressure decreases by more than 25% compared to pre-infusion values.\n- The volume loading is performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate.\n- One patient who died post-surgery was from SG.\n- Four patients who died post-surgery were from PG.\n- The cause of death for these patients was low cardiac out-put syndrome (LOS).\n- The measurements were higher in SG.\n- The mean of the measurements in SG was 29.1.\n- The standard deviation of the measurements in SG was 6.3.\n- The value is 18.4 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122.\n- The P-value is less than 0.0001.\n- The result is statistically significant due to the P-value being less than 0.05.\n- Stroke volume index (SVI) was measured preoperatively in group 1.\n- The preoperative SVI in group 1 was 29\u00b110mL/m2.\n- Stroke volume index (SVI) was measured in the early postoperative period in group 1.\n- The early postoperative SVI in group 1 was 22\u00b114mL/m2.\n- The SVI decreased from the preoperative period to the early postoperative period in group 1.\n- The difference has been statistically analyzed.\n- The result of the statistical analysis is significant.\n- The P-value of the statistical analysis is 0.002.\n- Cardiac index was measured in SG.\n- The cardiac index in SG was 320.7\u00b137.5.\n- The value is 283.0 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122.\n- The uncertainty or standard deviation is \u00b183.9 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122.\n- The P-value is 0.009.\n- There was a postoperative inotrophyc requirement.\n- The postoperative inotrophyc requirement in SG was 5.6\u00b12.7.\n- The measurement is 10.4\u00b12.0 mg/kg.\n- The P-value for the measurement is less than 0.008.\n- Postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG.\n- The P-value for the postoperative cardiac enzyme levels in SG is less than 0.01.\n- There are ten patients in SG.\n- The percentage of patients in SG is 28.5%.\n- These ten patients in SG required inotrophyc support.\n- There are 21 patients in PG.\n- The percentage of patients in PG is 60%.\n- These 21 patients in PG required inotrophyc support.\n- The difference in the need for inotrophyc support between SG and PG is statistically significant (P<0.001).\n- IABP was used in eight patients in SG.\n- The percentage of patients in SG where IABP was used is 22.8%.\n- IABP was used in 17 patients in CG.\n- The percentage of patients in CG where IABP was used is 48.5%.\n- The difference in the use of IABP between SG and CG is statistically significant with a P value of 0.0001.\n- The study showed an increase in left ventricular systolic functions.\n- The increase in left ventricular systolic functions was due to a combination of LS and SNP.\n- The study showed an increase in left ventricular diastolic functions.\n- The increase in left ventricular diastolic functions was due to a combination of LS and SNP.\n- The study showed an increase in LVEF.\n- The increase in LVEF was due to a combination of LS and SNP.\n- The increase in these functions was described as impressive.\n- The use of this combination resulted in less IABP requirement.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
