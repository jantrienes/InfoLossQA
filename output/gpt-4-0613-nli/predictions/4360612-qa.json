SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.\n\nRESULTS.\nSubjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority >0.999). Clinically important (\u226515 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 27.3% of NSM subjects. At six months, quality of life improved more in the surgery group and satisfaction rates were high. The mean number of adverse events in the first six months was slightly higher in the surgical group compared to the non-surgical group (1.3 vs. 1.0 events per subject, p=0.1857).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nSix-month follow-up from this level 1 study showed that minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving function and improving quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE.\nMinimally invasive SI joint fusion is an acceptable option for patients with chronic SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroiliac joint disruptions unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nLower back pain is often caused by a problem in the area where your spine connects to your hips, called the sacroiliac joint. Sometimes, this pain can be treated by using surgery to fuse or join together parts of this joint. However, we don't have any studies yet that have compared how patients do with this surgery versus without it.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe set up a study with 148 patients who had problems with their sacroiliac joint. We randomly picked some to get a special kind of low-impact surgery (102 people), while others (46 people) were treated without surgery. We measured how much pain and disability our patients were feeling when the study started. Then, we checked on them 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to see if there was an improvement. \n\nRESULTS.\nOur patients, most of whom were women and averaged 51 years of age, were having a lot of trouble with pain and disability at the start of the study. We were able to follow up with almost all of them at the six-month mark. By then, about 81.4% of the surgery patients were doing significantly better, compared to 23.9% of the non-surgery group. Also, 75% of the surgery group showed great improvement in how they were able to move around and do daily activities versus 27.3% in the non-surgery group. Finally, the surgery patients generally felt happier and more satisfied. \nHowever, it's worth mentioning that slightly more surgery patients experienced complications or side effects than non-surgery patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAfter six months, the results of our high-level study show that the low-impact surgery is much more effective than non-surgery treatment in reducing pain, improving motion, and increasing the happiness of patients who have problems with their sacroiliac joint.\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE. \nThis less-invasive surgery could be a good treatment option for patients with sacroiliac joint problems who aren't finding relief from non-surgical treatments.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Sacroiliac joint pain is prevalent.\n- Sacroiliac joint pain is underdiagnosed.\n- No study has compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction concurrently.\n- The condition in question is chronic SI joint dysfunction.\n- All subjects had SI joint dysfunction.\n- The SI joint dysfunction was due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions.\n- Subjects were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants or non-surgical management.\n- 102 subjects were assigned to minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants.\n- SI joint pain scores were collected at baseline.\n- Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was collected at baseline.\n- Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was collected at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement.\n- Short-Form 36 (SF-36) was collected at baseline.\n- Short-Form 36 (SF-36) was collected at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement.\n- EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) was collected at baseline.\n- EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) was collected at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement.\n- Success rates were defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain.\n- The success rates did not include severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events.\n- The success rates did not include cases of surgical revision.\n- The comparison of success rates was done using Bayesian methods.\n- 70% of the subjects are women.\n- The subjects were highly debilitated at baseline.\n- The mean SI joint VAS pain score of the subjects at baseline was 82.\n- The mean ODI score of the subjects at baseline was 62.\n- The follow-up was obtained in 97.3% of cases.\n- The 95% posterior credible interval is between 41.4% and 70.0%.\n- The improvement was at least 15 points.\n- The mean number of adverse events was calculated for both groups.\n- The mean number of adverse events in the surgical group was 1.3.\n- The p-value is 0.1857.\n- The SI joint dysfunction in patients was due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.\n- The study compared minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants with non-surgical management.\n- The minimally invasive SI joint fusion used triangular titanium implants.\n- The minimally invasive SI joint fusion was more effective in relieving pain.\n- The minimally invasive SI joint fusion was more effective in improving function.\n- The minimally invasive SI joint fusion was more effective in improving quality of life.\n- The chronic SI joint dysfunction can be due to degenerative sacroiliitis.\n- The chronic SI joint dysfunction can also be due to sacroiliac joint disruptions.\n- The patients considered for this treatment are unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
