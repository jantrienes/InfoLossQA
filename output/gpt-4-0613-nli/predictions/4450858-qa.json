If cervical ripening using a prostaglandin is required, a pre-labour overnight hospitalisation and separation from family and support companions is necessary. Recent evidence shows that balloon catheter cervical ripening is just as effective as prostaglandins, but does not cause uterine stimulation. For women with low risk pregnancies, this offers the possibility of undergoing the overnight ripening process in their own home. We conducted a pilot randomised trial to assess the outcomes, clinical pathways and acceptability to both women and clinicians of outpatient balloon catheter ripening compared with usual inpatient care.\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-eight women with low risk term pregnancies were randomised (2:1) to either outpatient (n = 33) or inpatient double-balloon catheter (n = 15) cervical ripening. Although not powered for statistically significant differences, the study explored potential direction of effect for key clinical outcomes such as oxytocin use, caesarean section and morbidities. Feedback on acceptability was sought from women at catheter insertion and 4 weeks after the birth, and from midwives and doctors, at the end of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nClinical and perinatal outcomes were similar. Most women required oxytocin (77 %). The outpatient group were 24 % less likely to require oxytocin (risk difference \u221223.6 %, 95 % CI \u221243.8 to \u22123.5). There were no failed inductions, infections or uterine hyperstimulation attributable to the catheter in either group. Most women in both groups reported discomfort with insertion and wearing the catheter, but were equally satisfied with their care and felt the baby was safe (91 % both groups). Outpatient women reported feeling less isolated or emotionally alone. Most midwives and doctors (n = 90) agreed that they are more comfortable in sending home a woman with a catheter than prostaglandins and 90 % supported offering outpatient ripening to eligible women.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient balloon catheter ripening should be further investigated as an option for women in an adequately powered randomised trial.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nProspectively registered, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612001184864.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nIn Australia, one out of four births are induced, or started artificially. Usually, this requires a woman to stay in a hospital overnight for a procedure involving a hormone called prostaglandin. However, new studies show that a balloon catheter, a tube with an inflatable section, can also be used for something called cervical ripening and is just as effective as prostaglandins. The bonus is that it doesn't cause stimulation of the womb. For low-risk pregnancies, this method allows women to have the procedure at home. We conducted an initial small-scale study to compare this at-home method with the usual in-hospital procedure in terms of results, how it's done, and how acceptable it is to both women and clinicians.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had 48 women with low-risk pregnancies take part in the study. Two thirds of them tried the at-home method while one third stayed in the hospital. We looked at a few key things, like whether labor-inducing drugs were needed, if a C-section was performed, and any health problems. We also got feedback on how acceptable this procedure was both from women and healthcare professionals.\n\nRESULTS.\nOutcomes for mother and baby were similar in both groups. Most women, 77%, needed labor-inducing drugs. However, the group at home was 24% less likely to need these drugs. There were no treatment failures, infections, or over-stimulation of the womb in either group. Most women reported discomfort with the balloon catheter but were equally satisfied overall. They felt their baby was safe and experienced less loneliness. Healthcare professionals were more comfortable with sending a woman home with a balloon catheter than prostaglandins, and most agreed they would offer the at-home method to eligible women.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study suggests that, for inducing labor, the at-home method using a balloon catheter deserves further investigation. It should be studied in a larger, more accurate trial.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in advance at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.\n\n## Missing facts\n- If a prostaglandin is used for cervical ripening, pre-labour overnight hospitalisation is required.\n- If a prostaglandin is used for cervical ripening, separation from family and support companions is necessary.\n- A pilot randomised trial was conducted.\n- The trial also aimed to assess the clinical pathways of outpatient balloon catheter ripening compared with usual inpatient care.\n- The trial further aimed to assess the acceptability of outpatient balloon catheter ripening to women.\n- The trial also aimed to assess the acceptability of outpatient balloon catheter ripening to clinicians.\n- The women were randomised in a 2:1 ratio.\n- Thirty-three women were assigned to outpatient cervical ripening.\n- Fifteen women were assigned to inpatient double-balloon catheter cervical ripening.\n- The pregnancies of the women involved in the study were at term.\n- The study was not powered for statistically significant differences.\n- The key clinical outcomes included oxytocin use.\n- The key clinical outcomes included caesarean section.\n- The key clinical outcomes included morbidities.\n- Feedback was sought from women at catheter insertion.\n- Feedback was sought from women 4 weeks after the birth.\n- Feedback was sought from midwives at the end of the study.\n- Feedback was sought from doctors at the end of the study.\n- The feedback was sought at the end of the study.\n- Oxytocin is required by women.\n- The majority of women require oxytocin.\n- 77% of women require oxytocin.\n- The study involves an outpatient group.\n- The outpatient group was less likely to require oxytocin.\n- The outpatient group was 24% less likely to require oxytocin.\n- The risk difference for requiring oxytocin was -23.6%.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the risk difference was calculated.\n- The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval was -43.8%.\n- The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was -3.5%.\n- There were no failed inductions attributable to the catheter in either group.\n- There were no infections attributable to the catheter in either group.\n- There was no uterine hyperstimulation attributable to the catheter in either group.\n- Most women in both groups reported discomfort with insertion of the catheter.\n- Most women in both groups reported discomfort with wearing the catheter.\n- Women in both groups were equally satisfied with their care.\n- Women in both groups felt the baby was safe.\n- 91% of women in both groups felt the baby was safe.\n- The statement involves outpatient women.\n- They reported feeling less isolated.\n- They also reported feeling less emotionally alone.\n- The statement involves a group of midwives and doctors.\n- The total number of midwives and doctors involved is 90.\n- Most of these midwives and doctors are more comfortable sending home a woman with a catheter than prostaglandins.\n- 90% of these midwives and doctors support offering outpatient ripening to eligible women.\n- The registration number of the trial is ACTRN12612001184864.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
