The units of randomisation were primary school classes recruited in May 2010. Eligible participants were Year 3 primary school classes in Lower Austria that had not participated in a similar programme during the last two years. After baseline assessment in September 2010, 53 classes from 45 primary schools in Lower Austria were randomly assigned to an intervention (n\u2009=\u200926 classes, 432 children) or waiting control arm (n\u2009=\u200927 classes, 493 children aged 8.7\u00a0years +/- 4\u00a0months). Over the course of 1.5 academic years, participating teachers received on-the-job training (20\u00a0h) and two workshops (8\u00a0h) to promote health related behaviour in students such as physical activity during the school day and to improve the quality of regular physical education classes. We assessed 15 outcomes grouped into five categories: Emotional and Social Experience in School, Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance measured by validated and standardised questionnaire and Motor Skills measured by validated and standardised motoric and coordination tests in the school gym. The primary outcome was Classroom Climate and part of the outcomecategory Emotional and Social Experience in School. The final assessment took place in April 2012. All assessors were blinded to the allocation of classes. Multilevel growth modelling was used to investigate programme effectiveness.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe could not detect any statistically significant differences between groups for the outcomecategories Emotional and Social Experience in school (p\u2009=\u20090.22 to 0.78), Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance. Significant differences between groups were limited to the outcomecategory Motor Skills (Complex Reaction Ability, Spatial Orientation Skills, Coordination with Precision) which were higher in the intervention group (P\u2009<\u2009.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nDespite small statistically significant differences in Motor Skills, our study could not detect any clinically relevant improvements in the Emotional and Social Experience at School (including the primary outcome ClassroomClimate), Physical Activity, Well-being, Motor Skills and Attention Performance of students.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nGerman register of clinical studies: DRKS00000622. Retrospectively registered: 03.12.2010. Approved by the Ethics Committee of Lower Austria (GS4-EK-4/107-2010).\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis summary is about a study of the Health Promoting Schools program, a model from the World Health Organization. This program has started in various countries, but we need more data to see whether it works really well.\n\nMETHODS.\nTo see if this program is effective, we tested it with Year 3 students in primary schools in Lower Austria. We picked 53 classes from 45 schools and divided them into two groups. One group used the program right away (432 children) and the other group waited to start the program (493 children). We checked how things were in September 2010 before the program started. Then, teachers in the first group were trained to promote healthy behaviors like exercising during the day and running better gym classes. After one and a half school years, we checked 15 different things grouped into five categories: 1. Feelings and social activities in school, 2. Physical activity, 3. Well-being, 4. Concentration, and 5. Physical skills measured in gym class. The main thing we wanted to learn was about the classroom atmosphere. We repeated the checks in April 2012.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe data did not show a big difference between the two groups in feelings and social activities at school, physical activity, well-being, and concentration. There was a noticeable difference only in physical skills, where the group that received the program performed a bit better.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEven though the children who participated in the program had slightly better physical skills, we didn't see substantial improvements in their feelings and social interaction at school, their physical activity, well-being, or their focus. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis study was registered in the German register of clinical studies, was recorded after it had started, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lower Austria.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The research is needed for evidence-based policy-making.\n- The trial was cluster randomised.\n- The recruitment of the primary school classes occurred in May 2010.\n- The classes had not participated in a similar programme in the last two years.\n- The classes were randomly assigned to different groups.\n- The on-the-job training lasted for 20 hours.\n- Teachers also attended two workshops as part of the program.\n- The two workshops lasted for a total of 8 hours.\n- The program also aimed to improve the quality of regular physical education classes.\n- The categories include Attention Performance.\n- The categories include Motor Skills.\n- Emotional and Social Experience in School was measured by a validated and standardised questionnaire.\n- Physical Activity was measured by a validated and standardised questionnaire.\n- There was a final assessment.\n- The assessors were not aware of the class allocations.\n- The process involved blinding the assessors to the class allocations.\n- Multilevel growth modelling was used.\n- The outcome categories also included Attention Performance.\n- The p-value for the outcome categories ranged from 0.22 to 0.78.\n- The significant differences were limited to the outcome category Motor Skills.\n- The Motor Skills category includes Complex Reaction Ability, Spatial Orientation Skills, and Coordination with Precision.\n- The intervention group had higher scores in the Motor Skills category.\n- The difference in Motor Skills scores between the groups was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u2009.05).\n- The study found small statistically significant differences in Motor Skills.\n- The study could not detect any clinically relevant improvements in Motor Skills.\n- The register has a study with the identifier DRKS00000622.\n- The approval occurred in the year 2010.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
