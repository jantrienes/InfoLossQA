In this study, we examined the effects of liraglutide versus metformin on non-esterified free fatty acids, beta-cell insulin secretion, and adhesion molecule levels in patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn this study, 60 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 33.97\u2009\u00b1\u20095.67\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide or oral metformin. Before the study and after the 8-week treatment period, a 75\u00a0g oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Plasma glucose, lipids and lipoprotein, plasma insulin, glycaemic and insulin responses, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter 8\u00a0weeks, 120\u00a0min of NEFA (155\u2009\u00b1\u2009125 vs 99\u2009\u00b1\u200973\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.026) and the levels of sVCAM-1 (465\u2009\u00b1\u2009136 vs 382\u2009\u00b1\u2009131\u00a0ng/ml, P\u2009=\u20090.013) significantly decreased, while the early phase insulin secretion index (24.94 [7.78, 38.89] vs. 31.13 [17.67, 59.09], P\u2009=\u20090.031), fasting plasma insulin (104 [51, 123] vs 113 [54, 171]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.015), 60\u00a0min plasma insulin (326 [165, 441] vs 471 [334, 717]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.005), 120\u00a0min plasma insulin (401 [193, 560] vs 500 [367, 960]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.047), and insulin area under the curve (AUCins) (648 [321, 742] vs 738 [451, 1118]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.005) remarkably increased for patients in the liraglutide treatment group. The levels of sVCAM-1 dramatically decreased after 8\u00a0weeks of liraglutide treatment (503\u2009\u00b1\u2009182 vs 382\u2009\u00b1\u2009131\u00a0ng/ml, P\u2009=\u20090.046) compared to that of the metformin treatment group. At the same time, the differences before and after liraglutide treatment in 120\u00a0min of NEFA (\u2212\u200932 [\u2212\u200996, \u2212\u20095] vs 5 [\u2212\u200935, 38]\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.033) and AUCins (738 [451, 1118] vs 594 [357, 1216]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.014) were remarkably enhanced compared to that of the metformin therapy. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in fasting NEFA after liraglutide or metformin treatment. The reduction of 120\u00a0min NEFA (\u0394NEFA) was positively correlated with the decrease of sVCAM-1 (\u0394sVCAM-1) after 8\u00a0weeks of liraglutide treatment (r\u2009=\u20090.523, P\u2009=\u20090.003).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results demonstrate that liraglutide administration is more effective than metformin in reducing 120\u00a0min NEFA and suppressing sVCAM-1 levels for recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. We suggest that this outcome may be because liraglutide is associated with potentiating insulin secretion capacity, inhibiting vascular inflammatory cytokines, and antagonizing atherosclerosis.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12933-018-0701-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at how a drug called liraglutide might help treat type 2 diabetes. We wanted to see if it could improve how the body uses sugar and fats. We also wanted to see if the drug could reduce damage to the blood vessels, which is a common complication of diabetes. We compared the effects of liraglutide to another popular diabetes medication, metformin.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested 60 people who had just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Half of them were given liraglutide and the other half were given metformin. We did a sugar tolerance test before the study and after 8 weeks of treatment. We also measured levels of different substances in their blood, such as glucose, fats, insulin, and a particular molecule associated with blood vessel damage.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter 8 weeks, those given liraglutide showed a good improvement. Their blood showed less of the harmful fats and of the molecule linked to blood vessel damage, and more insulin (which helps regulate sugar in the body). This group also had a better response to the sugar tolerance test. The people who took metformin didn't seem to improve as much.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLiraglutide seems to be a better option than metformin for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. It appears to help the body better manage sugar and fats, and it may reduce blood vessel inflammation and the risk of hardening of the arteries.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Liraglutide is suggested to have an impact on adhesion molecule activation.\n- Adhesion molecule activation is associated with diabetes.\n- The effects were examined on non-esterified free fatty acids.\n- The effects were also examined on beta-cell insulin secretion.\n- The effects were further examined on adhesion molecule levels.\n- All patients were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n- The mean age of the patients was 33.97 years.\n- The standard deviation of the patients' ages was 5.67 years.\n- One group of patients received once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide.\n- An oral glucose tolerance test was performed before the study.\n- The oral glucose tolerance test used was 75 g.\n- The NEFA levels significantly decreased after 8 weeks.\n- The levels of sVCAM-1 significantly decreased after 8 weeks.\n- The levels of sVCAM-1 decreased after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment.\n- The decrease in sVCAM-1 levels was dramatic.\n- The differences before and after liraglutide treatment in 120 min of NEFA were 5 [-35, 38] \u00b5mol/L after metformin therapy.\n- The differences in NEFA before and after liraglutide treatment were significantly enhanced compared to metformin therapy (P = 0.033).\n- The differences before and after liraglutide treatment in AUCins were 738 [451, 1118] mIU/L.\n- The differences in AUCins before and after liraglutide treatment were significantly enhanced compared to metformin therapy (P = 0.014).\n- Fasting NEFA levels were measured after the treatments.\n- There were no significant differences in fasting NEFA levels after liraglutide treatment.\n- There were no significant differences in fasting NEFA levels after metformin treatment.\n- The reduction of 120 min NEFA is measured after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment.\n- The decrease of sVCAM-1 is measured after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment.\n- There is a positive correlation between the reduction of 120 min NEFA and the decrease of sVCAM-1.\n- The correlation coefficient between the reduction of 120 min NEFA and the decrease of sVCAM-1 is 0.523.\n- Liraglutide administration was more effective in reducing 120 min NEFA.\n- Liraglutide administration was more effective in suppressing sVCAM-1 levels.\n- Metformin was less effective than liraglutide in reducing 120 min NEFA.\n- Metformin was less effective than liraglutide in suppressing sVCAM-1 levels.\n- Liraglutide is associated with potentiating insulin secretion capacity.\n- Liraglutide is associated with inhibiting vascular inflammatory cytokines.\n- The material is electronic.\n- The material is supplementary.\n- The article has an online version.\n- The online version of the article contains supplementary material.\n- The supplementary material is available to authorized users.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
