Participants in the two groups were prescribed the same goals for energy intake (1250\u20131550 kcal per day) and physical activity (200 min per week).\n\nRESULTS.\nWhile both groups produced significant improvements in weight and HbA1c after 6 months of treatment, PCD participants lost 7.3 kg [95% confidence interval (CI): \u22125.8 to \u22128.8 kg], compared with 2.2 kg (95% CI: \u22120.7 to \u22123.7 kg) in the DSME group (P<0.0001). Significantly more PCD than DSME participants lost \u2a7e5% of initial weight (54.0% vs 14.0%, P<0.0001) and \u2a7e10% (26.0% vs 6.0%, P<0.0001). HbA1c declined by 0.7% (95% CI: \u22120.4 to \u22121.0%) in the PCD group, compared with 0.4% (95% CI: \u22120.1 to \u22120.7%) in DSME (P<0.026). Across both groups, larger weight losses were associated with greater reductions in HbA1c (r=0.52, P<0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese findings demonstrate that a commercially available portion-controlled meal plan can induce clinically meaningful improvements in weight and glycemic control in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. These data have implications for the management of obesity in primary care, as now provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n## Simplification\nOBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this study is to see how effective a ready-to-eat, portion-controlled diet is on weight and blood sugar levels over six months in overweight patients with Type 2 diabetes.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe had 100 participants on average about 55 years old, weighing about 102.9 kilos, with a blood sugar level of 7.7%. They were placed randomly into two groups. One group used the portion-controlled diet as part of a nine-session lifestyle program, while the other group had a nine-session program focused on teaching them to manage Type-2 diabetes. Both groups had the same goals for daily calorie intake (1250-1550 calories) and weekly exercise (200 minutes).\n\nRESULTS\nOn the whole, both groups improved in weight and blood sugar levels after 6 months. However, those on the portion-controlled diet lost an average of 7.3 kilos compared to 2.2 kilos in the diabetes management group. More people in the portion-controlled diet group lost at least 5% of their starting weight and 10% of their starting weight. Blood sugar levels also decreased more in the portion-controlled group compared to the diabetes management group. Across both groups, the more weight lost, the better the decrease in blood sugar levels.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings show that ready-to-eat, portion-controlled meals can significantly improve weight and blood sugar control in overweight people with Type 2 diabetes. These results matter to doctors and health services who want to help patients deal with being overweight.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study examined the efficacy of a commercially available, portion-controlled diet.\n- The portion-controlled diet was tested on obese patients.\n- The study monitored changes in HbA1c levels.\n- The data set has a standard deviation.\n- One of the programs was a 9-session group lifestyle intervention that included a PCD.\n- The other program was a 9-session group program of diabetes self-management education (DSME).\n- Both groups produced significant improvements in weight and HbA1c after 6 months of treatment.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the weight loss in PCD participants is between -5.8 kg and -8.8 kg.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the weight loss in DSME group participants is between -0.7 kg and -3.7 kg.\n- The difference in weight loss between the PCD and DSME groups is statistically significant (P<0.0001).\n- The difference in the percentage of PCD and DSME participants who lost 5% of initial weight is statistically significant (P<0.0001).\n- The percentage of PCD participants who lost 10% of initial weight is 26.0%.\n- The difference in the percentage of PCD and DSME participants who lost 10% of initial weight is statistically significant (P<0.0001).\n- HbA1c declined by 0.7% in the PCD group.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the HbA1c decline in the PCD group is \u22120.4 to \u22121.0%.\n- HbA1c declined by 0.4% in the DSME group.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the HbA1c decline in the DSME group is \u22120.1 to \u22120.7%.\n- The decline in HbA1c in the PCD group is statistically significantly greater than in the DSME group.\n- The P-value for the difference in HbA1c decline between the PCD and DSME groups is less than 0.026.\n- Greater reductions in HbA1c were observed in these groups.\n- There is a positive association between larger weight losses and greater reductions in HbA1c.\n- The correlation coefficient (r) for the association between weight loss and HbA1c reduction is 0.52.\n- The P-value for this association is less than 0.0001.\n- The association between larger weight losses and greater reductions in HbA1c is statistically significant.\n- The findings show that a commercially available portion-controlled meal plan can lead to improvements in weight.\n- The meal plan can also improve glycemic control.\n- The improvements induced by the meal plan are clinically meaningful.\n- These obese individuals have type 2 diabetes.\n- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provide management for obesity in primary care.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
