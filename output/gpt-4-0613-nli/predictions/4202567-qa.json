Neuroimaging studies have shown that one of the most important areas corresponding to the working memory is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC). This study was aimed to assess whether bilateral modulation of the DLPFC using a noninvasive brain stimulation, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), modifies the working memory function in healthy adults.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a randomized sham-controlled cross-over study, 60 subjects (30 Males) received sham and active tDCS in two subgroups (anode left/cathode right and anode right/cathode left) of the DLPFC. Subjects were presented working memory n-back task while the reaction time and accuracy were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nA repeated measures, mixed design ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the type of stimulation (sham vs. active) in anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC [F(1,55)= 5.29, P=0.019], but not the inverse polarity worsened accuracy in the 2-back working memory task. There were also no statistically significant changes in speed of working memory [F(1,55)= 0.458,P=0.502] related to type or order of stimulation.\n\nDISCUSSION.\nThe results would imply to a polarity dependence of bilateral tDCS of working memory. Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair working memory, while the reverser stimulation had no effect. Meaning that bilateral stimulation of DLFC would not be a useful procedure to improve working memory. Further studies are required to understand subtle effects of different tDCS stimulation/inhibition electrode positioning on the working memory.\n\n## Simplification\nINTRODUCTION.\nWorking memory is essential for how we learn, remember, and interact with the world. One area of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), is particularly important for working memory. Our goal in this study was to see if we could change how the DLPFC works to improve memory using a safe, non-invasive method called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had 60 people (half men, half women) take part in our study. We split them into two groups and used tDCS to stimulate different sides of their DLPFC. All participants were given tasks to test their working memory while we measured their speed and accuracy.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur analysis indicated that the type of stimulation mattered. When we stimulated the left side of the DLPFC and reduced activity on the right side, it clearly messed with participants' memory accuracy. However, doing the opposite didn't have any noticeable effect. No changes in speed were seen either way.\n\nDISCUSSION.\nOur results suggest that how we use tDCS on working memory matters, and that stimulating the left side of the DLPFC while reducing activity on the right could disrupt memory. This means that using tDCS on both sides of this part of the brain may not be helpful for improving memory. We need more research to understand better how different uses of tDCS can affect working memory.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Neuroimaging studies have been conducted on the working memory.\n- These studies have identified important areas corresponding to the working memory.\n- The subjects of the study were healthy adults.\n- The study is a randomized sham-controlled cross-over study.\n- The task was a working memory n-back task.\n- A repeated measures, mixed design ANOVA was conducted.\n- The ANOVA indicated a significant difference.\n- The types of stimulation compared were sham and another unspecified type.\n- Anodal stimulation was applied to the left DLPFC.\n- The study involved a 2-back working memory task.\n- The statistical significance of the effect was measured.\n- The F-value of the effect was 5.29.\n- The P-value of the effect was 0.019.\n- The subtle effects are related to different tDCS stimulation/inhibition electrode positioning.\n- The electrode positioning affects the working memory.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
