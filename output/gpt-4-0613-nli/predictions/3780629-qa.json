They are emerging methods in experimental medicine typically used to treat mental health conditions.\n\n- Fact: The statement suggests that CBM protocols might best be combined with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT).\n- Question: What other form of therapy could be beneficially combined with CBM protocols according to the study?\n- Answer: The study suggests that CBM protocols could be effectively combined with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT).\n\n- Fact: A randomized controlled trial is currently being conducted.\n- Question: What type of study was used to examine the effects of the program?\n- Answer: The study used a method called a randomized controlled trial. This design is often used in research to test the effectiveness of treatments by randomly assigning participants to different groups.\n\n- Fact: The trial is evaluating the effects of a CBM protocol.\n- Question: What was the specific focus of the randomized controlled trial?\n- Answer: This randomized controlled trial was specifically evaluating the effects of a Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) protocol on depression.\n\n- Fact: The trial is also evaluating the combined effects of CBM-I followed by iCBT.\n- Question: Apart from CBM protocol, what was another aspect that the trial was evaluating?\n- Answer: Apart from evaluating the effects of the CBM protocol alone, the trial was also testing the combined effects of CBM followed by internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\n- Fact: The intervention included 1 week of CBM-I and 10 weeks of iCBT.\n- Question: How long was the treatment program and how was it broken down?\n- Answer: The treatment program lasted 11 weeks. It included one week of Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) and ten weeks of internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT).\n\n- Fact: The number of patients in the intervention group was 38.\n- Question: How many patients were in the group that underwent the treatment program?\n- Answer: There were 38 patients in the treatment group, who underwent the combined CBM and iCBT program.\n\n- Fact: The number of patients in the wait-list control group was 31.\n- Question: How many patients were in the control group?\n- Answer: The control group consisted of 31 patients, who were on a wait-list and did not receive any treatment.\n\n- Fact: Intent-to-treat marginal models were used in the study.\n- Question: What kind of statistical models were used in the study?\n- Answer: The study used intent-to-treat marginal models. These models are a type of statistical analysis that include all participants in a trial regardless of whether they completed the treatment or not, in order to provide a more realistic estimate of treatment effectiveness.\n\n- Fact: Restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used in the study.\n- Question: How were the statistical analyses conducted in the study?\n- Answer: The statistical analyses in the study were conducted using a method known as restricted maximum likelihood estimation. It is a statistical technique that helps to provide unbiased and accurate estimates in research data.\n\n- Fact: The effect sizes were quantified using Cohen's d.\n- Question: How were the effect sizes of the treatment measured in this study?\n- Answer: In this study, the effect sizes were measured using a statistic called Cohen's d. This is a measure that expresses the size of the difference between two groups of data.\n\n- Fact: The Cohen's d values ranged from 0.62 to 2.40.\n- Question: What was the range of the Cohen's d values in the study?\n- Answer: The Cohen's d values in the study ranged from 0.62 to 2.40. Higher values indicate larger effect sizes, meaning the treatment had a strong impact on the depression symptoms.\n\n- Fact: The reductions were observed following CBM-I intervention.\n- Question: When were the reductions in depression symptoms observed?\n- Answer: The reductions in depression symptoms were observed following the computerized exercises, also referred to as the Computerized cognitive-bias modification intervention.\n\n- Fact: The reductions were also observed following the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention.\n- Question: Were reductions in depression symptoms observed after the combined CBM and online therapy intervention as well?\n- Answer: Yes, reductions in depression symptoms were also observed following the combined intervention of computerized exercises and online therapy.\n\n- Fact: The change in interpretation bias partially mediated the reduction in depression symptoms.\n- Question: What effect did changes in interpretation bias have on depression symptoms?\n- Answer: Changes in interpretation bias had a mediating effect on the reduction of depression symptoms. This means that by altering negative thought patterns through the program, it partially led to a decrease in depression symptoms.\n\n- Fact: The reduction in depression symptoms occurred following CBM-I.\n- Question: After what treatment did the reduction in depression symptoms occur?\n- Answer: The reduction in depression symptoms occurred after the Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) intervention.\n\n- Fact: The change in interpretation bias occurred at least partially due to CBM-I.\n- Question: What aspect of the treatment led to a change in the interpretation bias of the patients?\n- Answer: The change in interpretation bias of the patients occurred at least partially due to the computerized exercises, known as the Computerized cognitive-bias modification intervention.\n\n- Fact: Treatment showed superiority over the WLC.\n- Question: How did the treatment compare to the control group?\n- Answer: The treatment performed better than the control group. This means patients who received the treatment experienced greater improvements in their depression symptoms compared to those on the waitlist.\n\n- Fact: The Hedges gs value for the treatment superiority ranged from .59 to .98.\n- Question: How did the researchers measure the superiority of the treatment over the wait-list control group?\n- Answer: The researchers used a measure called Hedges' g. The values for this measure ranged from .59 to .98, indicating a moderate to large effect size. This means the treatment was moderately to substantially more effective than the wait-list control group.\n\n- Fact: The Cohen's d value ranged from 1.51 to 2.23.\n- Question: What was the range of the Cohen's d values seen in the secondary measures associated with depression like disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking?\n- Answer: The Cohen's d values for the secondary measures associated with depression ranged from 1.51 to 2.23. These numbers represent sizeable effect sizes, indicating significant improvements in these secondary measures of disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking.\n\n- Fact: Twenty-seven percent of patients showed clinically significant change following CBM-I.\n- Question: How many patients showed a clinically significant change after the Computerized cognitive-bias modification intervention?\n- Answer: Twenty-seven percent of patients showed a clinically significant change, which means their depression symptoms decreased enough to be considered a significant improvement in their mental health, after completing the computerized exercises."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1202, "completion_tokens": 1477, "total_tokens": 2679}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nObjective: Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) protocols are rapidly evolving in experimental medicine yet might best be combined with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). No research to date has evaluated the combined approach in depression. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate both the independent effects of a CBM protocol targeting imagery and interpretation bias (CBM-I) and the combined effects of CBM-I followed by iCBT. Method: Patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode were randomized to an 11-week intervention (1 week/CBM-I + 10 weeks/iCBT; n = 38) that was delivered via the Internet with no face-to-face patient contact or to a wait-list control (WLC; n = 31). Results: Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.62\u20132.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention. Analyses demonstrated that the change in interpretation bias at least partially mediated the reduction in depression symptoms following CBM-I. Treatment superiority over the WLC was also evident on all outcome measures at both time points (Hedges gs = .59\u2013.98). Significant reductions were also observed following the combined intervention on secondary measures associated with depression: disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking (Cohen's d = 1.51\u20132.23). Twenty-seven percent of patients evidenced clinically significant change following CBM-I, and this proportion increased to 65% following the combined intervention. Conclusions: The current study provides encouraging results of the integration of Internet-based technologies into an efficacious and acceptable form of treatment delivery.\n\n## Simplification\nGoal: The study aims to test a program that combines computerized exercises and online therapy to improve depression symptoms. Until now, no one has tested how well this combination works for treating depression. \n\nMethod: Individuals with severe depression were randomly selected to participate in this 11-week program, which includes a week of computerized exercises and ten weeks of online therapy, done entirely online with no face-to-face meetings. They were compared to another group who were on a wait-list and did not receive any treatment.\n\nResults: The results showed that both the computerized exercises and the combination of these exercises and online therapy significantly reduced depression symptoms and levels of distress. This improvement was moderately to very strong, according to standard measurement tools. The reduction in depression symptoms was at least partly due to the ability of individuals to alter their negative thought patterns, as trained by the computerized exercises. The treatment group performed better than the wait-list group on every outcome measure at both time points. Measures such as disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thoughts also significantly improved following the combined intervention. At the end of the computerized exercises, 27% of patients showed clinically significant improvements, and this percentage increased to 65% after completing the online therapy as well.\n\nConclusion: This study provides promising results that offering therapy through internet-based technologies can be an effective and acceptable method for treating depression.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) protocols are rapidly evolving in experimental medicine.\n- The statement suggests that CBM protocols might best be combined with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT).\n- A randomized controlled trial is currently being conducted.\n- The trial is evaluating the effects of a CBM protocol.\n- The CBM protocol targets imagery and interpretation bias (CBM-I).\n- The trial is also evaluating the combined effects of CBM-I followed by iCBT.\n- The effects of CBM-I and iCBT are being evaluated independently and in combination.\n- The intervention included 1 week of CBM-I and 10 weeks of iCBT.\n- The number of patients in the intervention group was 38.\n- The number of patients in the wait-list control group was 31.\n- Intent-to-treat marginal models were used in the study.\n- Restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used in the study.\n- The effect sizes were quantified using Cohen's d.\n- The Cohen's d values ranged from 0.62 to 2.40.\n- The reductions were observed following CBM-I intervention.\n- The reductions were also observed following the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention.\n- Analyses were conducted on the change in interpretation bias and reduction in depression symptoms.\n- The change in interpretation bias partially mediated the reduction in depression symptoms.\n- The reduction in depression symptoms occurred following CBM-I.\n- The change in interpretation bias occurred at least partially due to CBM-I.\n- Treatment showed superiority over the WLC.\n- The Hedges gs value for the treatment superiority ranged from .59 to .98.\n- The effect size of the reductions was measured using Cohen's d.\n- The Cohen's d value ranged from 1.51 to 2.23.\n- Twenty-seven percent of patients showed clinically significant change following CBM-I.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
