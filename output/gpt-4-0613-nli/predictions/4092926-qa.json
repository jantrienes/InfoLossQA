Thirty-two Boer kids X 1/2 NDB (no defined breed), males, non-castrated, with 4 months of age and initial body weight of 15\u00b13.2 kg, were randomly assigned to individual pens. The treatments contained four substitution levels of soybean meal by sunflower cake (0, 33, 66 and 100% DM). At the end of the experimental period, the animals were slaughtered. There was no influence of the treatments on any of the mean values of the evaluated measures (p>0.05): 21.78 kg (body weight at slaughter), 8.65 kg (hot carcass weight), 8.59 kg (cold carcass weight), 40.27% (hot carcass yield), 39.20% (cold carcass yield), 7.73 cm2(rib eye area), 46.74 cm (carcass outer length), 45.68 cm (carcass internal length), 36.92 cm (leg length), 26.04 cm (leg perimeter), 48.66 cm (hind perimeter), 58.62 cm (thoracic perimeter), 0.20 (carcass compactness index), 68.48% (total muscle of the leg), 2.79% (total leg fat), 55.19% (subcutaneous leg fat), 28.82% (total bone), 81.66 g (femur weight), 14.88 cm (femur length), 0.38 (leg muscularity index), 2.53 (muscle:bone ratio) and 33.42 (muscle:fat ratio). The substitution of soybean meal by sunflower cake may be recommended up to a level of 100% without alterations to quantitative carcass traits.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study was trying to find out how well sunflower cake could replace soybean meal in the food given to young goats. We had 32 young goats, each weighing around 15 kilograms, and they were each kept in their own pens. We tried out four different diets, varying the amount of soybean meal replaced by sunflower cake (0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%). \n\nAt the end of the study, we found that no matter how much sunflower cake we used in place of soybean meal, the goats' overall size, leg dimensions, amount of muscle, fat and bone weight, and muscle-to-fat ratios stayed about the same. \n\nSo, it seems sunflower cake can be fully used in place of soybean meal in goat food without any noticeable changes in how the goats grow.\n\n## Missing facts\n- A study was conducted recently.\n- There are thirty-two Boer kids.\n- The Boer kids are half NDB (no defined breed).\n- The Boer kids are males.\n- The Boer kids are non-castrated.\n- The Boer kids are 4 months old.\n- The initial body weight of the Boer kids is 15\u00b13.2 kg.\n- The Boer kids were randomly assigned to individual pens.\n- The substitution levels were 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% DM.\n- The animals were slaughtered.\n- The slaughtering of the animals occurred at the end of the experimental period.\n- The mean body weight at slaughter was 21.78 kg.\n- The mean hot carcass weight was 8.65 kg.\n- The mean cold carcass weight was 8.59 kg.\n- The mean hot carcass yield was 40.27%.\n- The mean cold carcass yield was 39.20%.\n- The mean rib eye area was 7.73 cm2.\n- The mean carcass outer length was 46.74 cm.\n- The mean carcass internal length was 45.68 cm.\n- The recommendation is for the substitution of soybean meal with sunflower cake.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
