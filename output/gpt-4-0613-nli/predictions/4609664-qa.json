The teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 25 each (n=25). In groups 1, 2 and 3 the teeth were prepared using Mtwo, PTU and RCP, respectively. While in group 4 (control group) the samples were left unprepared. After preparation, all specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of root at 3, 5 and 9-mm distances from the apex. The sections were then individually observed under 12\u00d7 magnification using stereomicroscope. The data was analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. The level of significance was set at 0.05.\n\nRESULTS.\nNo cracks were observed in the control group. All engine-driven systems caused dentinal cracks. Mtwo and PTU caused cracks significantly more than RCP (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between RCP and control group (P>0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAll three engine-driven systems created dentinal defects. Reciproc caused less cracks than Mtwo and ProTaper Universal.\n\n## Simplification\nINTRODUCTION.\nThis study looked at possible damage to teeth (called \"dentinal cracks and craze lines\") during root canal treatments using three different dental tools.\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS.\nA hundred human premolars (kind of teeth) with single canals were used. They were grouped into four sets of 25 each. Teeth in the first three groups were treated with one of the three dental tools each. The last group's teeth were left untreated as a control. After these treatments, parts of the teeth were cut and examined under a microscope. The gathered data was then statistically analysed.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe control group of untreated teeth showed no cracks. All the treatment methods caused some cracks. Two of the tools, Mtwo and ProTaper Universal, caused significantly more cracks than the third tool, Reciproc which didn't cause significantly more cracks than the untreated group. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nAll three treatment methods caused some dental damage. But the tool Reciproc caused the least, being nearly equivalent to no treatment at all.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The comparison was made during root canal preparation.\n- The three NiTi endodontic systems are Reciproc (RCP), ProTaper Universal (PTU) and Mtwo.\n- One hundred mandibular premolars were selected.\n- The selected mandibular premolars were extracted.\n- Each of the selected mandibular premolars has a single canal.\n- The selected mandibular premolars were decoronated.\n- The division of teeth into groups was random.\n- Group 1's teeth were prepared using Mtwo.\n- Group 2's teeth were prepared using PTU.\n- The samples in group 4 were left unprepared.\n- The sectioning of the specimens was done perpendicular to the long axis of root.\n- The specimens were sectioned at 3-mm distance from the apex.\n- The specimens were sectioned at 5-mm distance from the apex.\n- The specimens were sectioned at 9-mm distance from the apex.\n- The magnification used for observation was 12\u00d7.\n- A stereomicroscope was used for observation.\n- The chi-square test was used in the analysis.\n- Fisher's exact test was used in the analysis.\n- The level of significance is 0.05.\n- Engine-driven systems can cause dentinal cracks.\n- No dentinal cracks are caused by non-engine-driven systems.\n- The difference in the number of cracks caused by Mtwo, PTU, and RCP is statistically significant (P<0.05).\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
