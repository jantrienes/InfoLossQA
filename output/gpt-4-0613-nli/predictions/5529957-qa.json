Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.\n\nRESULTS.\nRiociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: \u2212285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \u2212357 to \u2212213); p<0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; \u2212131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \u2212214 to \u221248); p=0.0025) patients. Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p<0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI \u22120.1 to 0.5; p=0.17). Mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased in inoperable and persistent/recurrent patients(\u22124.7 mm Hg (95% CI \u22126.9 to \u22122.6; p<0.0001 and \u22124.8 mm Hg (\u20138.2 to \u22121.5; p=0.0055), respectively). For all patients, changes in 6 min walk distance correlated with changes in PVR (r=\u22120.29 (95% CI \u22120.41 to \u22120.17); p<0.0001) and cardiac index (r=0.23 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.35); p=0.0004).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nRiociguat improved haemodynamics in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent CTEPH.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.\nNCT00855465.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL.\nThe aim of this study was to see if the drug riociguat helped patients with a certain type of non-operable chronic lung disease.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested 261 patients (average age 59, 66% women) who had this chronic lung disease and could not have surgery or still had the disease after surgery. We gave some patients the drug riociguat and others a placebo. We tested certain indicators of heart and lung function at the start of the experiment and 16 weeks later. \n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that riociguat reduced resistance to blood flow in the lungs in both groups of patients, improving their heart's ability to pump blood. The drug also reduced blood pressure in the lungs. Furthermore, patients who showed improvement in the indicators we were testing also walked longer in a 6-minute walking test, suggesting they had better overall health. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings suggest that riociguat can improve heart and lung function in patients with this non-operable chronic lung disease. This research was registered with the trial registration number NCT00855465.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The comparison involved patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).\n- The comparison also involved patients with persistent/recurrent CTEPH after pulmonary endarterectomy.\n- The comparison was part of the Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension Soluble Guanylate Cyclase\u2013Stimulator Trial 1 study.\n- The study involved patients with inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH.\n- The dosage of riociguat given was up to 2.5 mg.\n- Riociguat was administered three times daily.\n- The number of inoperable patients treated with Riociguat was 189.\n- The least-squares mean difference of PVR in inoperable patients treated with Riociguat was -285 dyn s/cm5.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the decrease in PVR in inoperable patients treated with Riociguat was -357 to -213.\n- The p-value for the decrease in PVR in inoperable patients treated with Riociguat was less than 0.0001.\n- Riociguat was used on persistent/recurrent patients.\n- The number of persistent/recurrent patients treated with Riociguat was 72.\n- Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in persistent/recurrent patients.\n- The least-squares mean difference of the cardiac index improvement in inoperable patients was +0.6 L/min/m2.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the cardiac index improvement in inoperable patients was 0.4 to 0.7.\n- The p-value for the cardiac index improvement in inoperable patients was less than 0.0001.\n- The cardiac index also changed in persistent/recurrent patients.\n- The change in the cardiac index for persistent/recurrent patients was +0.2 L/min/m2.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the cardiac index change in persistent/recurrent patients was -0.1 to 0.5.\n- The p-value for the cardiac index change in persistent/recurrent patients was 0.17.\n- The decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure in inoperable patients was -4.7 mm Hg.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the decrease in inoperable patients was -6.9 to -2.6.\n- The p-value for the decrease in inoperable patients was less than 0.0001.\n- The mean pulmonary artery pressure also decreased in persistent/recurrent patients.\n- The decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure in persistent/recurrent patients was -4.8 mm Hg.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the decrease in persistent/recurrent patients was -8.2 to -1.5.\n- The p-value for the decrease in persistent/recurrent patients was 0.0055.\n- The correlation coefficient between changes in 6 min walk distance and changes in PVR is -0.29.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the correlation between changes in 6 min walk distance and changes in PVR is -0.41 to -0.17.\n- The p-value for the correlation between changes in 6 min walk distance and changes in PVR is less than 0.0001.\n- Changes in 6 min walk distance also correlated with changes in cardiac index.\n- The correlation coefficient between changes in 6 min walk distance and changes in cardiac index is 0.23.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the correlation between changes in 6 min walk distance and changes in cardiac index is 0.10 to 0.35.\n- The p-value for the correlation between changes in 6 min walk distance and changes in cardiac index is 0.0004.\n- Riociguat has an effect on haemodynamics.\n- The patients had inoperable CTEPH.\n- The patients had persistent CTEPH.\n- The patients had recurrent CTEPH.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
