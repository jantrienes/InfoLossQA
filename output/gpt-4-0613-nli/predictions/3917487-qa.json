health status of young adultfemale endurance swimmers.\n\nMETHODS.\n In a randomized controlled trial, 46 endurance swimmers girls with mean age of 13.8 \u00b11.8 years,weight of 48.6\u00b17.5kg and height of 159\u00b15.6cm, were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups,receiving either 400 ml probiotic yogurt (intervention group) or ordinary yogurt (control group) daily for 8weeks. At the beginning and at the end of the study, the 400-m free swimming record was done and the HarvardStep test was employed to measure VO2max. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS software.This trial has been registered with IRCT ID of IRCT2012122311849N1.\n\nRESULTS.\n Average changes in the records of the intervention and control groups were 3.9 and 0.5 seconds, respectively(p= 0.22). The intervention group complained of dyspnea for 2.4 days and the value for the controlwas 4.4 days (p=0.024). Values for ear pain were 0.5 and 1.6 days (p=0.008) respectively. The average numberof episodes of respiratory infection in the intervention group was 0.9 day, which was statistically fewer than thatin the control group (1.4 days), P=0.009.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\n A reduction in the number of episodes of respiratory infections and duration of some symptomssuch as dyspnea and ear pain was observed. Due to the reduction in upper respiratory tract infections of theathletes following intake of probiotic yogurt, improvement in VO2max is possible.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study aims to explore the results of eating probiotic yogurt on the physical performance and general health of young female swimmers.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a study with 46 young, female endurance swimmers, and split them into two groups randomly. We asked one group to consume 400 ml of probiotic yogurt daily for eight weeks while the other group was given regular yogurt. Then, we measured their swimming speed and their oxygen usage during exercise, both pre and post study. We analyzed all data using a specific type of software called SPSS. This study has been officially registered.\n\nRESULTS.\nOn average, the probiotic yogurt group improved their swimming speed slightly more than the regular yogurt group. They also reported less difficulty breathing and ear pain, and had fewer respiratory infections.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nWe observed that eating probiotic yogurt reduced respiratory infections and problems like difficulty with breathing and ear pain. This suggests that the intake of probiotic yogurt could enhance their oxygen usage during exercise due to less respiratory tract infections.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The mean age of the participants was 13.8 years.\n- The age variation among the participants was \u00b11.8 years.\n- The mean weight of the participants was 48.6kg.\n- The weight variation among the participants was \u00b17.5kg.\n- The mean height of the participants was 159cm.\n- The 400-m free swimming record was done at the beginning of the study.\n- The 400-m free swimming record was done at the end of the study.\n- The HarvardStep test was used in the study.\n- The HarvardStep test was used to measure VO2max.\n- The trial's registration ID is IRCT2012122311849N1.\n- The trial is registered with IRCT.\n- The average change in the records of the intervention group was 3.9 seconds.\n- The average change in the records of the control group was 0.5 seconds.\n- The intervention group complained of dyspnea for 2.4 days.\n- The control group complained of dyspnea for 4.4 days.\n- The difference in dyspnea duration between the intervention and control group was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.024.\n- The first recorded value for ear pain was 0.5 days.\n- The second recorded value for ear pain was 1.6 days.\n- The p-value for the ear pain data was 0.008.\n- The intervention group had an average of 0.9 day of respiratory infection episodes.\n- The control group had an average of 1.4 days of respiratory infection episodes.\n- Dyspnea was one of the symptoms whose duration was reduced.\n- This reduction is due to the intake of probiotic yogurt.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
