Chloroquine resistance in P. vivax is emerging in Asia. Therapeutic responses across Afghanistan have not been evaluated in detail.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween July 2007 and February 2009, an open-label, randomized controlled trial of chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in patients aged three months and over with slide-confirmed P. vivax mono-infections was conducted. Consistent with current national guidelines, primaquine was not administered. Subjects were followed up daily during the acute phase of illness (days 0-3) and weekly until day 56. The primary endpoint was the overall cumulative parasitological failure rate at day 56 after the start of treatment, with the hypothesis being that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was non-inferior compared to chloroquine (\u0394 = 5% difference in proportion of failures).\n\nRESULTS.\nOf 2,182 individuals with positive blood films for P. vivax, 536 were enrolled in the trial. The day 28 cure rate was 100% in both treatment groups. Parasite clearance was more rapid with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine than chloroquine. At day 56, there were more recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm (8.9%, 95% CI 6.0-13.1%) than the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-5.8%), a difference in cumulative recurrence rate of 6.1% (2-sided 90%CI +2.6 to +9.7%). The log-rank test comparing the survival curves confirmed the superiority of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over chloroquine (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that a lower initial haemoglobin concentration was also independently associated with recurrence. Both regimens were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nChloroquine remains an efficacious treatment for the treatment of vivax malaria in Afghanistan. In a setting where radical therapy cannot be administered, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine provides additional benefit in terms of post-treatment prophylaxis, reducing the incidence of recurrence from 4-8 weeks after treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT00682578.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nIn Afghanistan, the standard treatment for most cases of malaria (a disease caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite) is a drug called chloroquine. But some malaria parasites in Asia are becoming resistant to this drug. The effectiveness of the drug in Afghanistan hasn't been extensively tested.\n\nMETHODS.\nFrom July 2007 to February 2009, we ran a study on patients who were at least three months old and had malaria. We tested the effect of chloroquine and another drug called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. We checked them daily at first, then weekly for eight weeks. We saw which treatment was better at preventing the malaria parasite from returning.\n\nRESULTS.\nOut of 2,182 people with malaria that we found, 536 took part in the test. After four weeks, everyone in both treatment groups was cured. But we saw that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine cured the disease faster. After eight weeks, fewer people in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group got sick again. Both treatments were safe and didn\u2019t make anyone seriously ill.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe chloroquine drug is still good for treating malaria in Afghanistan. The alternative drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine can also give extra protection stopping the disease from coming back.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nWe registered this trial online at ClinicalTrials.gov, where it is registered under the number NCT00682578.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Afghanistan has national guidelines for treating diseases.\n- These national guidelines recommend chloroquine for a specific treatment.\n- The specific treatment is for Plasmodium vivax infection.\n- The majority of malaria burden in Afghanistan is due to Plasmodium vivax infection.\n- The emergence is happening in Asia.\n- The trial was open-label.\n- The trial was randomized.\n- The trial was controlled.\n- The patients in the trial had slide-confirmed P. vivax mono-infections.\n- The decision not to administer primaquine is consistent with current national guidelines.\n- Subjects were followed up daily during the acute phase of illness.\n- The acute phase of illness is defined as days 0-3.\n- The follow-up period extended until day 56.\n- The primary endpoint was the overall cumulative parasitological failure rate at day 56.\n- The hypothesis was that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was non-inferior compared to chloroquine.\n- Non-inferiority was defined as a 5% difference in proportion of failures.\n- There were 2,182 individuals with positive blood films for P. vivax.\n- The trial involved individuals with positive blood films for P. vivax.\n- The day 28 cure rate was measured.\n- The day 28 cure rate was 100% in the first treatment group.\n- The day 28 cure rate was 100% in the second treatment group.\n- There were recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm.\n- The rate of recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm was 8.9%.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the rate of recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm was 6.0-13.1%.\n- There were also recurrent infections in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm.\n- The rate of recurrent infections in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm was 2.8%.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the rate of recurrent infections in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm was 1.4-5.8%.\n- The difference in cumulative recurrence rate between the two arms was 6.1%.\n- The 2-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference in cumulative recurrence rate was +2.6 to +9.7%.\n- A log-rank test was used to compare survival curves.\n- The log-rank test confirmed the superiority of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over chloroquine.\n- The p-value of the test was 0.003.\n- A multivariate analysis was conducted.\n- The analysis showed an association between lower initial haemoglobin concentration and recurrence.\n- The association between lower initial haemoglobin concentration and recurrence is independent.\n- Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine can be used when radical therapy cannot be administered.\n- The setting mentioned does not allow for the administration of radical therapy.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
