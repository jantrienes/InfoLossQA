1 view according to the Cormack-Lehane scale. A grade 1 view means that most of the vocal cords were visible and it is the most favourable condition for intubation.\n\n- Fact: With the AirtraqTM laryngoscope, no patients had a grade 3 or 4 Cormack-Lehane glottic view.\n- Question: Were there any patients who had a grade 3 or 4 view of the throat area, according to the Cormack-Lehane scale, when using the Airtraq laryngoscope?\n- Answer: No, when using the Airtraq laryngoscope, no patients had a grade 3 or 4 view according to the Cormack-Lehane scale. Grades 3 and 4 indicate a more difficult view and greater difficulty in intubation.\n\n- Fact: The AirtraqTM laryngoscope was superior to the McCoyTM and Macintosh laryngoscopes.\n- Question: How did the performance of the Airtraq laryngoscope compare to the McCoy and Macintosh laryngoscopes in the study?\n- Answer: The Airtraq laryngoscope performed better or was superior to both the McCoy and Macintosh laryngoscopes in the study."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1286, "completion_tokens": 1503, "total_tokens": 2789}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS.\nThe study aimed at comparing the performance of the novel optical AirtraqTM laryngoscope with the McCoyTM and conventional Macintosh laryngoscopes for ease of endotracheal intubation in patients with neck immobilisation using manual inline axial cervical spine stabilisation (MIAS) technique.\n\nMETHODS.\nNinety consenting American Society of Anaesthesiologist's physical status I\u2013II patients, aged 18\u201360 years, scheduled for various surgeries requiring tracheal intubation were randomly assigned into three groups of thirty each to undergo intubation with Macintosh, AirtraqTM, or McCoyTM laryngoscope with neck immobilisation by MIAS technique. The ease of intubation based on Intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score, Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic view, optimisation manoeuvres and impact on haemodynamic parameters were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA and Bonferroni correction for post hoc tests.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll patients in three groups had a comparable demographic profile and were successfully intubated. The AirtraqTM laryngoscope significantly reduced the IDS (mean \u2212 0.43 \u00b1 0.81) as compared with both McCoyTM (mean \u2212 1.63 \u00b1 1.49, P = 0.001) and Macintosh laryngoscope (mean \u22122.23 \u00b1 1.92, P < 0.001) and improved the Cormack-Lehane glottic view (77% grade 1 view and no patients with grade 3 or 4 view). There were less haemodynamic variations during laryngoscopy with the AirtraqTM compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope, but there was not between the AirtraqTM and McCoyTM laryngoscope groups.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn patients undergoing endotracheal intubation with cervical immobilisation, AirtraqTM laryngoscope was superior to the McCoyTM and Macintosh laryngoscopes, with greater ease of intubation and lower impact on haemodynamic variables.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS.\nThis study is about comparing three different types of tools used for placing breathing tubes in patients who have limited neck movement. The devices being compared are the Airtraq, McCoy, and a standard tool called the Macintosh laryngoscope.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe selected 90 adults, all relatively healthy and undergoing surgeries that need breathing tubes, to be part of this study. These 90 people were divided into three equal groups and each group was intubated using one of the devices. We measured how easy it was to use the device, the view of the throat area it provided, any additional maneuvers used to make intubation successful, and how it affected the patients' heart rates and blood pressure levels. We then used statistical analysis to compare the results. \n\nRESULTS.\nAll the patients in the three groups were successfully intubated. The Airtraq device made the process easier than the other two. It also provided a clearer view of the throat area. During the use of the Airtraq, there were fewer changes in the patients' heart rates and blood pressure levels compared to the Macintosh device but there were similar changes as when using the McCoy device.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor patients who need breathing tubes and whose necks can't move a lot, the Airtraq device makes it easier to place the tubes and cause less change in heart rate and blood pressure than the traditional Macintosh device and also the McCoy device.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The neck immobilisation was achieved using the manual inline axial cervical spine stabilisation (MIAS) technique.\n- The AirtraqTM laryngoscope is described as novel or new.\n- All patients were consenting.\n- The patients were part of the American Society of Anaesthesiologist's physical status I\u2013II.\n- The age range of the patients was 18\u201360 years.\n- The patients were randomly assigned into three groups.\n- Optimisation manoeuvres are recorded.\n- The statistical analysis used ANOVA.\n- The statistical analysis used Bonferroni correction.\n- Bonferroni correction was used for post hoc tests.\n- The demographic profile of all patients in these groups is comparable.\n- The AirtraqTM laryngoscope significantly reduced the IDS.\n- The mean IDS reduction with the Macintosh laryngoscope was -2.23 \u00b1 1.92.\n- The IDS reduction with the AirtraqTM laryngoscope was significantly greater than with the McCoyTM laryngoscope (P = 0.001).\n- The IDS reduction with the AirtraqTM laryngoscope was significantly greater than with the Macintosh laryngoscope (P < 0.001).\n- The AirtraqTM laryngoscope improved the Cormack-Lehane glottic view.\n- With the AirtraqTM laryngoscope, 77% of patients had a grade 1 Cormack-Lehane glottic view.\n- With the AirtraqTM laryngoscope, no patients had a grade 3 or 4 Cormack-Lehane glottic view.\n- The AirtraqTM laryngoscope was superior to the McCoyTM and Macintosh laryngoscopes.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
