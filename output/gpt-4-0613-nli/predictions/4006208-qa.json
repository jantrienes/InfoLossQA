The aim of the present study was to access the effect of Aloe vera mouthwash on the dental plaque in the experimental period of 4 days and to compare it with the bench mark control chlorhexidine and placebo (saline water).\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nA total of 300 systemically healthy subjects were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Aloe vera mouthwash group (n=100), control group (=100)-chlorhexidene group and saline water-Placebo (n=100). To begin with, Gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were recorded. Then, baseline plaque scores were brought to zero by professionally cleaning the teeth with scaling and polishing. After randomization of the participants into three groups they were refrained from regular mechanical oral hygiene measures. Subjects were asked to swish with respective mouthwash (Aloe vera mouthwash, 0.2%chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, or normal saline) as per therapeutic dose for 4 days.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe results showed that Aloe vera mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing plaque as Chlorhexidine compared to placebo over a period of 4 days. There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them (p>0.05). Aloe vera mouthwash showed no side effects.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe results of the present study indicated that Aloe vera may prove an effective mouthwash due to its ability in reducing dental plaque.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThere's a growing problem with antibiotics not working as effectively, and more people are experiencing oral diseases. This study was to see if Aloe vera mouthwash could help with oral health issues, particularly dental plaque. Specifically, we wanted to see how Aloe vera mouthwash worked over four days, compared to the usual mouthwash (chlorhexidine) and a mouthwash that isn't supposed to do anything (saline water).\n\nMaterial and Methods.\n300 healthy volunteers were split into three equal groups. One group used Aloe vera mouthwash, another used chlorhexidine mouthwash (the usual stuff), and the third used saline water (which doesn't do anything). At the start, we tested the health of everyone's gums (ginigval index) and how much plaque they had (plaque index). We then cleaned everyone's teeth professionally so everyone started with no plaque. For the next four days, the volunteers only used their assigned mouthwash, without brushing or flossing. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe study found that both the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash were equally good at reducing plaque over those four days. Meanwhile, the saline water didn't do much (as expected). The difference in plaque reduction between the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash wasn't significant enough to matter. Also, no one reported any bad side effects from the Aloe vera mouthwash.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBased on this study, Aloe vera could be a good alternative mouthwash. It was successful in reducing dental plaque, just as effective as the usual chlorhexidine mouthwash, but without any side effects.\n\n## Missing facts\n- There is a need for alternative treatment modalities for oral diseases.\n- The study also aims to compare the effect of Aloe vera mouthwash with a placebo.\n- Chlorhexidine is used as a benchmark control in the study.\n- Baseline plaque scores were brought to zero.\n- The method of cleaning used was scaling and polishing.\n- The mouthwash used could be 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash.\n- The mouthwash used could be normal saline.\n- The mouthwash was used as per therapeutic dose.\n- A placebo was used in the study.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
