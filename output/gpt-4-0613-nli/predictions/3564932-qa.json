Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nMETHODS.\nWomen with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nRESULTS.\nOPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nSometimes, doctors need to induce labor in pregnant women, which means they have to artificially start the labor process. This is a common procedure that affects both the woman and the health care system. One way to reduce the impact, is to carry out the procedure in an outpatient setting, meaning the patient can go home after the procedure instead of staying at the hospital. There's not much information on how outpatient and inpatient inductions compare, and also some safety worries if outpatient inductions use a certain medication used in inpatient settings. This study is aiming to see if it's feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients to induce labor in an outpatient setting using a Foley catheter, compared to inpatient inductions using vaginal PGE2.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn the study, 101 women who needed labor induced were split into two groups. 50 women were in the outpatient group and used a Foley catheter for induction. These women were able to go home overnight after a reassuring test. The other 51 women were in the inpatient group and used vaginal PGE2 for induction. The main things checked were how long the hospital stay was, how the baby was born, how long it took from induction to delivery, any side effects, and how satisfied the patients were.\n\nRESULTS.\nWomen in the outpatient group spent less time in the hospital before giving birth, but those in the inpatient group were more likely to have a vaginal birth within 12 hours of going to the Birthing Unit. Overall vaginal birth rates, the time from induction to delivery, and total time spent in the hospital were almost the same for both groups. However, the outpatient group felt less pain and had better sleep but were more likely need additional labor induction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient labor induction was feasible and acceptable for women who are not in a good condition to give birth naturally, however, it did not show a significant reduction in total time spent in the hospital and was associated with increased need for labor induction.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis study has been reported to the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.\n\n## Missing facts\n- IOL is one of the most common obstetric interventions.\n- IOL also has a significant impact on health service delivery.\n- Outpatient IOL is considered an attractive option.\n- Prostaglandins are the standard inpatient IOL medications.\n- The safety concern mentioned is hyperstimulation.\n- This method is used at term.\n- The study involves women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term.\n- The discharge followed a reassuring cardiotocograph.\n- A cardiotocograph was performed on the OPC group.\n- The dosage of vaginal PGE2 for nulliparous in the IP group was 2 mg/1 mg.\n- The dosage of vaginal PGE2 for multiparous in the IP group was 1 mg/1 mg.\n- The duration of the OPC group's hospital stay prior to birth was 21.3.\n- The p-value is less than .001.\n- The percentage of IP achieving vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit is 53%.\n- The percentage value given is 28%.\n- The p-value is .01.\n- Vaginal birth rates are 66% for OPC.\n- The total induction to delivery time is 33.5 hours.\n- There is a total inpatient time of 96 hours for OPC.\n- 105 hrs IP exists.\n- The OPC group experienced less pain during cervical preparation.\n- The percentage of significant discomfort in the OPC group was 26%.\n- The percentage of significant discomfort in the comparison group was 58%.\n- The difference in discomfort between the OPC group and the comparison group was statistically significant (p = .003).\n- The average sleep duration for the OPC group was 5.8 hours.\n- The average sleep duration for the comparison group was 3.4 hours.\n- The difference in sleep duration between the OPC group and the comparison group was statistically significant (p < .001).\n- The OPC group was more likely to require oxytocin IOL.\n- OPC was feasible for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term.\n- OPC was acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term.\n- OPC was compared to IP for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term.\n- OPC did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay compared to IP.\n- OPC was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n- The registry has an entry with the ACTRN:12609000420246.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
