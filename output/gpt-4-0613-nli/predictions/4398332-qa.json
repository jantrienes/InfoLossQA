Another main constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has seemingly opposite functional effects on the brain. This study aimed to determine the effects of THC and CBD, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, THC (8 mg), CBD (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. In comparison to placebo, CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% emotional intensity; THC was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces of 40% intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both THC alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 'stoned'. CBD did not influence feelings of 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, CBD improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by THC. This is the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve and impair recognition of emotional faces.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at how THC and CBD, two main components of cannabis, affect how we perceive human emotions. THC tends to lead to misinterpreting faces with unclear emotions, while CBD actually improves this ability, particularly with emotions that are not very strong. When the two are combined, there is no negative effect on understanding emotions. Both THC taken alone, and THC combined with CBD, make people feel 'high', but CBD doesn't have this effect. Our previous cannabis use or personalities don't affect these outcomes. This is the first study that discusses how different components of cannabis can either help or harm our ability to recognize emotions in others.\n\n## Missing facts\n- \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis.\n- Acute administration of THC impairs human facial affect recognition.\n- Cannabidiol (CBD) has functional effects on the brain.\n- The study is specifically looking at the impact on emotional facial affect recognition.\n- There were 48 volunteers involved in the study.\n- The volunteers were selected based on their frequency of cannabis use.\n- The volunteers were also selected based on their schizotypy.\n- The volunteers were administered THC.\n- The dosage of THC administered was 8 mg.\n- The volunteers were administered CBD.\n- The dosage of CBD administered was 16 mg.\n- The volunteers were administered a combination of THC and CBD.\n- The dosage of the combination was 8 mg of THC and 16 mg of CBD.\n- The task was an emotional facial affect recognition task.\n- The task included recognizing fearful faces.\n- The task included recognizing angry faces.\n- The task included recognizing happy faces.\n- The task included recognizing sad faces.\n- The task included recognizing surprise faces.\n- The task included recognizing disgust faces.\n- The intensity of the faces varied in the task.\n- A visual analogue scale (VAS) was completed.\n- The VAS was related to the feeling of being 'stoned'.\n- CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% emotional intensity.\n- This improvement was in comparison to a placebo.\n- The detrimental effect of THC was observed at 40% intensity.\n- THC alone increases feelings of being 'stoned'.\n- Combined THC+CBD also increases feelings of being 'stoned'.\n- The increase in feelings of being 'stoned' from THC alone is equal to the increase from combined THC+CBD.\n- The feelings of being 'stoned' are compared relative to a placebo.\n- There were no effects found related to the frequency of use.\n- There were no effects found related to schizotypy.\n- These pharmacological agents act upon the endocannabinoid system.\n- The pharmacological agents can also impair recognition of emotional faces.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
