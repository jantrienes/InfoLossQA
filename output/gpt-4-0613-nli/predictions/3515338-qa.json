Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.\n\nMETHODS.\nAn economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score \u2265 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were \u20ac4795 in the PST group and \u20ac6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nPST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNederlands Trial Register ISRCTN51021015\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND\nMany people struggle with mental health issues, which can lead to other health problems and higher healthcare costs. We wanted to know if having nurses help these patients work through their problems (a method called Problem-Solving Treatment or PST) in the normal setting of a primary care doctor's office could be a useful and cost-effective way to manage mental health more efficiently. \n\nMETHODS\nWe did a study, alongside a clinical trial, tracking costs and outcomes in two groups of patients who were known to have mental health problems (based on a standard questionnaire called the General Health Questionnaire) and had visited their family doctor at least three times in the past 6 months. One group was treated by their regular doctors in the normal way. The other was also treated by nurses using Problem-Solving Treatment. \n\nRESULTS\nNine months later, there was no major difference in mental health outcomes in the two groups. But the costs were lower for the group receiving nurse-led PST. Despite some statistical variations in the data, further analysis still showed that this method of managing mental health by nurses was cost-effective.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that using nurses to deliver this type of problem-solving treatment can be a cost-effective way of taking care of patients with mental health problems. However, the cost difference was heavily influenced by a few patients who had unusually high costs in the regular doctor's care group, so we must be cautious in generalizing these results.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nOur trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register with the number ISRCTN51021015.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Mental health problems are associated with increased disability.\n- The study compared PST with usual care (UC).\n- The evaluation was from a societal perspective.\n- The evaluation was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial.\n- A positive General Health Questionnaire score is equal to or greater than 4.\n- Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score are eligible for something.\n- Eligibility requires both a positive General Health Questionnaire score and at least three visits to a general practitioner in the past 6 months.\n- One of the outcome measures was improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n- Another outcome measure was QALYs.\n- QALYs were based on the EQ-5D.\n- The questionnaire used for measuring resource use is validated.\n- Some cost data was missing.\n- Some effect data was missing.\n- The missing data was imputed.\n- Multiple imputation techniques were used for imputation.\n- Bootstrapping was used as an analysis method.\n- The analysis compared PST with UC.\n- The lack of differences in clinical outcomes is statistically significant.\n- There are two groups: PST and UC.\n- The mean total costs for the PST group were \u20ac4795.\n- The mean total costs for the UC group were \u20ac6857.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the difference in costs was -4698 to 359.\n- The analysis compared PST and UC.\n- PST was found to be more cost-effective than UC.\n- Sensitivity analyses were conducted.\n- The findings were confirmed by the sensitivity analyses.\n- PST is compared with UC in terms of cost-effectiveness.\n- PST is more cost-effective than UC.\n- The difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers.\n- These 3 outliers had extremely high indirect costs.\n- These 3 outliers were in the UC group.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
