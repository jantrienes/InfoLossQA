This means the care plan involves multiple specialists who work together in a coordinated way. \n\n- Fact: The IMD approach consists of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment.\n- Question:  What does the integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach involve?\n- Answer: The IMD approach requires the patient to go through a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment at the MS clinic.\n\n- Fact: Quality of life was measured using the MSIS-29 scale.\n- Question: How was the patient's quality of life measured in the trial?\n- Answer: The patient's quality of life was measured using a scale known as MSIS-29, which is a tool specifically designed to measure the impact of MS on a person's life. \n\n- Fact: The median MSIS 29 score decreased over six months in the control group.\n- Question: How did the median MSIS 29 scores change in the control group over the course of the trial?\n- Answer: In the control group, which received the standard care, the median MSIS 29 score decreased over the six months.\n\n- Fact: The p-value of the difference between the two groups was 0.03.\n- Question: How significant was the difference in quality of life scores between the two treatment strategies?\n- Answer: Looking just at the raw scores, the difference was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.03.

How this multidisciplinary care should be organized and structured has not been studied.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe objective of this article is to address the effectiveness of an integrated multidisciplinary approach versus usual care in MS patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients. Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care. The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty MS patients were included. Median MSIS 29 score decreased over six months in the control group (\u22124.89) and increased in the IMD group (+2.00), with a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.03). However, in the multivariate analysis, after adjustment of HAD-D and INTERMED score, this difference was no longer significant.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis prospective, randomized study is the first attempt to evaluate the multidisciplinary approach in MS patients. The results show that, contrary to our expectations, an integrated multidisciplinary approach is not superior to usual care on QoL.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nPeople with multiple sclerosis (MS) often require care from many different doctors, which can create a complex system for managing their health. We don't yet know the best way to organize this type of team-based care.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study aims to find out if coordinating these multiple specialists in an integrated approach is more effective than the regular forms of care for MS patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a study with MS patients, comparing two different methods of care. The first method was a new, integrated team approach where the patients would spend a half-day at the MS clinic going through a comprehensive personal health assessment. The second method was the normal standard of care. We looked at how these two methods affected patients' quality of life (QoL), which was measured with a specific scale, at the start of the trial and after six months.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe involved 50 MS patients in our study. At the end of six months, the regular care group's quality of life score decreased a little, while the integrated care group's quality of life score increased a little. This difference looked significant at first glance. But, when we adjusted for other variables, the difference didn't stand out.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis is the first study trying to evaluate the use of a team-based approach to care for MS patients. Contrary to what we thought, the results show that coordinating multiple specialists in an integrated approach doesn't seem to make a big difference in improving quality of life compared to regular care.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The trial is prospective.\n- The trial is randomized.\n- The trial is monocentric.\n- The first treatment strategy is an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach.\n- The IMD approach consists of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment.\n- The assessment in the IMD approach is conducted in the MS clinic.\n- Quality of life was measured using the MSIS-29 scale.\n- The measurement was taken at inclusion.\n- The measurement was taken again after six months.\n- All the patients had MS (Multiple Sclerosis).\n- The median MSIS 29 score decreased over six months in the control group.\n- The decrease in the control group's median MSIS 29 score was -4.89.\n- The median MSIS 29 score increased over six months in the IMD group.\n- The increase in the IMD group's median MSIS 29 score was +2.00.\n- There was a significant difference between the control group and the IMD group's median MSIS 29 scores.\n- The p-value of the difference between the two groups was 0.03.\n- A multivariate analysis was conducted.\n- The analysis involved adjustment of HAD-D and INTERMED score.\n- Before the adjustment, there was a significant difference.\n- After the adjustment of HAD-D and INTERMED score, the difference was no longer significant.\n- The study is prospective.\n- The study is randomized.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
