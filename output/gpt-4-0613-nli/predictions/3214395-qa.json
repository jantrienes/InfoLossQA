It gives us a way to estimate how deeply asleep a patient is during anesthesia.\n\n- Fact: Halothane was used in a 50% mixture of oxygen and N2O.\n- Question: What type of anesthesia was used for the children and in what mixture?\n- Answer: We used halothane, which is a type of inhaled anesthetic. It was mixed equally with oxygen and nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas.\n\n- Fact: Tracheal intubation was performed.\n- Question: What was done after the children were put to sleep with the anesthesia?\n- Answer: After the children were deeply asleep, we performed a procedure called tracheal intubation. This involves putting a tube down the throat into the windpipe to help the child breathe during surgery.\n\n- Fact: The patients were scheduled for elective surgery.\n- Question: What type of surgery were the children in the study having?\n- Answer: The children in the study were scheduled for elective surgery, which is non-emergency surgery that has been planned in advance.\n\n- Fact: The duration of laryngoscopy was recorded.\n- Question: What was recorded after the children were put to sleep and the tube was put in?\n- Answer: We kept track of how long it took to look at and examine the voice box and the back of the throat using a small hand-held mirror placed in the back of the throat. This process is called laryngoscopy.\n\n- Fact: The presence of laryngospasm was recorded.\n- Question: What types of complications were being watched for during the study?\n- Answer: We were on the lookout for conditions like laryngospasm, which is an abnormal reflex caused by a spasm of the vocal cords. It can make it harder to breathe in or out.\n\n- Fact: The presence of bronchospasm was recorded.\n- Question: Were there any other complications being monitored during the study?\n- Answer: Yes, we were also watching for bronchospasm, a sudden contraction of the walls of the bronchi, the large airways in the lungs, which can cause breathing difficulties.\n\n- Fact: Laryngoscopy failure was recorded.\n- Question: What other issues did you record during the study?\n- Answer: We kept a record of whether or not we were able to successfully perform laryngoscopy. If we couldn't do it for some reason, that was marked as a laryngoscopy failure.\n\n- Fact: Changes in SpO2 were recorded.\n- Question: What other types of measurements were taken during the study?\n- Answer: We also monitored and recorded changes in SpO2, which is a measurement of the amount of oxygen in the patient's blood.\n\n- Fact: The analysis methods used were chi-square and ANOVA.\n- Question: How did you analyze the information you collected in the study?\n- Answer: We used two statistical analysis methods, chi-square and ANOVA, to look for significant differences in our data.\n\n- Fact: The level of significance used in the analysis was 0.05.\n- Question: What level of significance did you use in your analysis?\n- Answer: We used a level of significance of 0.05. This means if a result had less than a 5% chance of occurring by pure luck, we would consider it statistically significant.\n\n- Fact: There were no differences in the occurrence of bronchospasm among the three groups.\n- Question: Were there any differences in the occurrence of bronchospasm between the three groups of children in the study?\n- Answer: No, there were no significant differences in the occurrences of bronchospasm among the three groups of children.\n\n- Fact: There were no differences in the occurrence of laryngoscopy failure among the three groups.\n- Question: Were there any differences in the success of laryngoscopy between the three groups?\n- Answer: No, there were no significant differences in the rate of laryngoscopy failures among the three groups.\n\n- Fact: The patients were ASA I & II.\n- Question: What was the health status of the children in the study?\n- Answer: The children in the study were categorized as ASA I or II, which is a way doctors classify a patient's physical status before surgery. ASA I means a healthy patient, while ASA II refers to a patient with a mild systemic disease.\n\n- Fact: The target BIS values were 60 \u00b1 2, 50 \u00b1 2, and 40 \u00b1 2.\n- Question: What were the target levels of sleep that were used in the study?\n- Answer: The target BIS values, or levels of sleep, that were used in the study were 60 plus or minus 2, 50 plus or minus 2, and 40 plus or minus 2. \n\n- Fact: The BIS values in question range from 60 to 40.\n- Question: What were the range of BIS values observed in the study?\n- Answer: In this study, the observed BIS values ranged from 60 to 40, with the target being to lower the value by incrementally increasing the anesthesia."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1252, "completion_tokens": 1336, "total_tokens": 2588}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND.\nInduction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 \u00b1 2, 50 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.\n\nRESULTS.\nBIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nGetting the right level of anesthesia for a surgery is very important. For children, the most common method is to have them breathe in the anesthetic. A tube may need to be put down the throat once the child is deeply asleep. It can be hard to tell exactly how deep the sleep is. One way to measure this is using something called a Bispectral index (BIS). In this study, we wanted to see how well the BIS can tell us when a child is asleep enough for the tube to be safely put in.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a test with ninety children who were aged 1 to 6 years and were about to have surgery. We started to monitor their BIS and separated them randomly into three groups. The anesthesia was started by gradually increasing the amount of anesthetic in a mix of oxygen and nitrous oxide. We kept increasing until the BIS reached certain target levels. After the tube was put in, we noted how long the process took, whether there were any complications like trouble breathing, if the child moved, and how long they stayed asleep. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe BIS didn't help us to know the best level of anesthesia for putting the tube in. There was no difference in how long it took, whether there were any problems, or how long the children stayed asleep between the three groups. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results showed that there wasn't a significant difference in problems related to putting in the tube at different BIS levels. To make sure the level of anesthesia is deep enough, we might need to aim for lower BIS values.\n\n\n## Missing facts\n- Induction of anesthesia is a period of general anesthesia.\n- The induction of anesthesia is considered the most crucial period.\n- This technique is used in pediatric anesthesia.\n- Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia.\n- The effects measured by bispectral index are on the brain.\n- The patients were ASA I & II.\n- The patients were scheduled for elective surgery.\n- Halothane was used in a 50% mixture of oxygen and N2O.\n- The target BIS values were 60 \u00b1 2, 50 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2.\n- Tracheal intubation was performed.\n- The duration of laryngoscopy was recorded.\n- The presence of laryngospasm was recorded.\n- The presence of bronchospasm was recorded.\n- Laryngoscopy failure was recorded.\n- Changes in SpO2 were recorded.\n- The analysis methods used were chi-square and ANOVA.\n- The level of significance used in the analysis was 0.05.\n- The setting was specific to tracheal intubation.\n- There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration among the three groups.\n- There were no differences in the occurrence of laryngospasm among the three groups.\n- There were no differences in the occurrence of bronchospasm among the three groups.\n- There were no differences in the occurrence of laryngoscopy failure among the three groups.\n- There were no differences in awakening time among the three groups.\n- The BIS values in question range from 60 to 40.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
