The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of the first dose of treatment, and the secondary outcomes were changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument score, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) over a 4-hour observation period. Infants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to four groups: A (dexamethasone + racemic epinephrine) = 45, B (placebo and racemic epinephrine) =39, C (dexamethasone and salbutamol) = 40, or D (placebo and salbutamol) = 38.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients who had received dexamethasone + epinephrine exhibited similar admission rates compared to placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.64). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of hospitalization for patients who received dexamethasone + salbutamol compared to those who received placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.51). Clinical parameters were improved at the end of the 4-hour observation period for all treatment groups. Treatment with dexamethasone + epinephrine resulted in a statistically significant change in HR over time (P < 0.005) compared to the other groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study adds to a body of evidence suggesting that corticosteroids have no role in the management of bronchiolitis for young infants who are first time wheezers with no risk of atopy.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis research looked at how well infants with a common lung infection called bronchiolitis responded to different combinations of medicines. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study investigated the effects on babies between 1 to 12 months old. The babies were divided into four groups and were given different combinations of drugs. The major goal was to see if combining these drugs could reduce the need for hospital stays. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe study showed that the combination of dexamethasone and epinephrine resulted in the same number of hospital admissions as the other combinations. This was also the case for the combination of dexamethasone and salbutamol. However, the babies receiving these combinations showed improvements in their breathing and heart rates. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study concluded that this does not support the use of corticosteroids (like dexamethasone) in managing bronchiolitis in young first-time wheezing infants.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study investigated the effect of combining oral dexamethasone with other treatments.\n- The other treatments combined with oral dexamethasone were either nebulized racemic epinephrine or salbutamol.\n- Nebulized racemic epinephrine is a potential treatment for bronchiolitis.\n- Oral dexamethasone is a potential treatment for bronchiolitis.\n- Bronchodilators alone are a potential treatment for bronchiolitis.\n- The trial was double-blind.\n- The infants were diagnosed in the emergency department.\n- The diagnosis for the infants was moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis.\n- The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of the first dose of treatment.\n- The secondary outcomes were changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument score.\n- The secondary outcomes also included changes in respiratory rate.\n- The secondary outcomes also included changes in oxygen saturation (O2 Sat).\n- These secondary outcomes were observed over a 4-hour period.\n- There were 162 infants involved in the study.\n- The infants were randomly assigned to four groups.\n- Group A was given dexamethasone and racemic epinephrine.\n- Group A consisted of 45 infants.\n- Group B was given a placebo and racemic epinephrine.\n- Group B consisted of 39 infants.\n- Group C was given dexamethasone and salbutamol.\n- Group C consisted of 40 infants.\n- Group D was given a placebo and salbutamol.\n- Some patients received placebo + epinephrine.\n- The P value of the comparison was 0.64.\n- The P-value of the comparison was 0.51.\n- Each treatment group underwent an observation period.\n- The observation period lasted for 4 hours.\n- The improvement in clinical parameters was observed at the end of the observation period.\n- The change in HR was statistically significant.\n- The statistical significance of the change in HR was measured as P < 0.005.\n- The change in HR was compared to other groups.\n- The study contributes to existing evidence.\n- These infants have no risk of atopy.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
