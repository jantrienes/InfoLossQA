that the OnControl device led to longer samples?\n- Answer: Yes, the difference in average sample length between the two testing methods was statistically significant, meaning it was too big to be due to chance.\n\n- Fact: The P-value for the difference in mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens between the OBM and SBM groups was less than 0.003.\n- Question: How sure can we be that the difference in sample lengths is not due to random chance?\n- Answer: The p-value of the difference was less than 0.003, a value of less than 0.05 is generally taken as good evidence, so we can be very confident that this difference is significant and not due to random chance.\n\n- Fact: The secondary endpoint was the mean procedure time, skin-to-skin.\n- Question: Besides sample size, what other result did the researchers measure?\n- Answer: They also measured the average total time taken for each procedure, from breaking the skin to finishing up the procedure, known as the \"skin-to-skin\" time.\n\n- Fact: The mean procedure time for the OBM group was 175 seconds.\n- Question: How long did the procedures take on average when using the OnControl device?\n- Answer: On average, the procedures using the OnControl device took just 175 seconds from start to finish.\n\n- Fact: The mean procedure time for the SBM group was 292 seconds.\n- Question: How long did the procedures take on average when using the regular needle?\n- Answer: With the regular needle, the procedures took longer, averaging 292 seconds.\n\n- Fact: The difference in mean procedure time between the OBM and SBM groups was statistically significant with a P value less than 0.007.\n- Question: Is the time difference between the two methods statistically significant?\n- Answer: Yes, the difference in the average time taken for procedures using the two different tools was statistically significant, with a P value less than 0.007.\n\n- Fact: There are several subjective secondary endpoints.\n- Question: Besides sample length and procedure time, were there other factors that the researchers considered?\n- Answer: Yes, the researchers also looked at several subjective factors, like how the doctors-in-training felt about the procedures.\n\n- Fact: The new standard of care is the OBM.\n- Question: Which method does the study suggest as the new standard for bone marrow tests?\n- Answer:

compare a novel bone marrow device with the standard marrow needle in a prospective, randomized study in a teaching hospital employing hematologists-in-training. The new device, the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, utilizes a battery-powered drill to insert the needle. Fifty-four bone marrows (27 standard and 27 OBM) were performed by 11 fellows under the observation and supervision of 3 attending hematologists and 1 research technologist. The primary endpoint of the study, the mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens, a surrogate for marrow quality, was determined by a pathologist in a blinded manner. The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens was significantly longer (56%) for the OBM group (15.3 mm) than for the standard bone marrow (SBM) group (9.8 mm), P<0.003. An objectively determined secondary endpoint; mean procedure time, skin-to-skin; also favored the OBM group (175 s) versus the SBM group (292 s), P<0.007. Several subjective secondary endpoints also favored the OBM group. Only minor adverse events were encountered in the OBM and SBM study groups. It was concluded that bone marrow procedures (BMPs) performed by hematologists-in-training were significantly faster and superior in quality when performed with the OBM compared to the SBM. These data suggest that the OBM may be considered a new standard of care for adult hematology patients. OBM also appears to be a superior method for training hematology fellows.\n\n## Simplification\nThe goal of this research was to compare a newly developed bone marrow device with the regular bone marrow needle. The study took place in a teaching hospital, with medical trainees overseen by experienced doctors and a research technician. The new device, called the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, is powered by a battery-operated drill to insert its needle.\n\nThe research carried out 54 bone marrow tests, half done with the standard needle and half done with the new OnControl device. The main goal measured was the average length of the bone marrow samples taken out, as longer samples usually mean better quality. The ones taken out by the OnControl device were, on average, over half as long again as the ones taken out with the regular needle.\n\nThe researchers also timed the procedures and found that the OnControl device completed its tests significantly faster than the regular needle did. Other measures also favored the OnControl device. There were only a few minor problems in both groups of tests.\n\nTherefore, the researchers concluded that bone marrow tests carried out by doctors-in-training are faster and provide better results when the OnControl device is used compared to the regular needle. Consequently, this device could be favored as a new norm for adult patients needing hematology, and it is a better tool for teaching medical trainees in hematology.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study was prospective.\n- The study was randomized.\n- There were 27 standard bone marrows.\n- There were 27 OBM bone marrows.\n- The bone marrows were performed by 11 fellows.\n- The observation and supervision were done by 3 attending hematologists.\n- The determination of the mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens was done by a pathologist.\n- The pathologist determined the mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens in a blinded manner.\n- The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens for the OBM group was 15.3 mm.\n- The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens for the SBM group was 9.8 mm.\n- The difference in mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens between the OBM and SBM groups was statistically significant.\n- The P-value for the difference in mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens between the OBM and SBM groups was less than 0.003.\n- The secondary endpoint was the mean procedure time, skin-to-skin.\n- The mean procedure time for the OBM group was 175 seconds.\n- The mean procedure time for the SBM group was 292 seconds.\n- The difference in mean procedure time between the OBM and SBM groups was statistically significant with a P value less than 0.007.\n- There are several subjective secondary endpoints.\n- The new standard of care is the OBM.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
