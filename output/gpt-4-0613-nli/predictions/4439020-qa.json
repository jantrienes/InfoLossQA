We here aimed to prove the efficacy of normobaric hyperoxia on the absorption of postoperative pneumocephalus according to a standardized treatment protocol.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS.\nWe enrolled 44 patients with postoperative supratentorial pneumocephalus (> 30 ml) after posterior fossa surgery in a semisitting position. After randomisation procedure, patients received either normobaric hyperoxia at FiO2 100% over an endotracheal tube for 3 hours (treatment arm) or room air (control arm). Routine cranial CT scans were performed immediately (CT1) and 24 hours (CT2) after completion of surgery and were rated without knowledge of the therapy arm. Two co-primary endpoints were assessed: (i) mean change of pneumocephalus volume, and (ii) air resorption rate in 24 hours. Secondary endpoints were subjective alertness (Stanford Sleepiness Scale) postoperatively and attention (Stroop test), which were evaluated preoperatively and 24 hours after surgery. The mean change in pneumocephalus volume was higher in patients in the treatment arm as compared to patients in the control arm (p = 0.001). The air resorption rate was higher in patients in the treatment arm as compared to patients in the control arm (p = 0.0015). Differences were more pronounced in patients aged 52 years and older. No difference between patients in treatment arm and control arm was observed for the Stroop test. The distribution of scores in the Stanford Sleepiness Scale differed in the treatment arm as compared to the control arm, and there was a difference in mean values (p = 0.015).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAdministration of normobaric hyperoxia at FiO2 100% via an endotracheal tube for 3 hours is safe and efficacious in the treatment of pneumocephalus after posterior fossa surgery in the semisitting position. Largest benefit was found in elderly patients and particularly in older men.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nGerman Clinical Trials Register DRKS00006273\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nSometimes after a type of brain surgery, patients can experience symptoms such as alertness loss due to a condition where air fills up their brain cavities. We studied whether treating this condition with pure oxygen via a breathing tube can help absorb this air build-up.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS.\nWe investigated 44 patients who underwent brain surgery and experienced air build-up in their brain. Half of these patients were given pure oxygen for 3 hours while the other half simply breathed in normal room air. We performed scans on their brains just after the surgery and 24 hours afterwards. Without knowing who had received the oxygen treatment, we assessed the change in air volume in their brains and the air absorption rate 24 hours after the surgery. Our findings suggest that the air build-up reduced more in the patients who received the oxygen treatment. This effect was especially pronounced in patients who were above 52 years old. However, there was no significant difference in attention levels (measured by a test) between the two groups. The alertness level differed between the two groups, with the oxygen-treated patients had increased alertness.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe oxygen treatment administered through a tube after brain surgery is safe and effective in reducing air build-up in the brain. Older patients, especially men, benefit the most from this treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe experiment was officially logged with the German Clinical Trials Register.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Supratentorial pneumocephalus can occur after posterior fossa surgery.\n- The semisitting position is used during posterior fossa surgery.\n- Supratentorial pneumocephalus can lead to decreased alertness.\n- Supratentorial pneumocephalus can lead to other symptoms.\n- The aim is to prove the efficacy of normobaric hyperoxia.\n- The efficacy test will follow a standardized treatment protocol.\n- 44 patients were enrolled in the study.\n- The patients had postoperative supratentorial pneumocephalus.\n- The volume of the pneumocephalus was more than 30 ml.\n- The patients had undergone posterior fossa surgery.\n- The surgery was performed in a semisitting position.\n- A randomisation procedure was used in the study.\n- Some patients received normobaric hyperoxia.\n- The normobaric hyperoxia was administered at FiO2 100%.\n- The normobaric hyperoxia was administered over an endotracheal tube.\n- The normobaric hyperoxia treatment lasted for 3 hours.\n- This group of patients receiving normobaric hyperoxia is referred to as the treatment arm.\n- This group of patients receiving room air is referred to as the control arm.\n- Routine cranial CT scans were performed immediately after surgery.\n- The same CT scans were performed 24 hours after the completion of surgery.\n- The CT scans were rated without knowledge of the therapy arm.\n- There were two instances of CT scans, referred to as CT1 and CT2.\n- CT1 refers to the immediate post-surgery scan.\n- CT2 refers to the scan performed 24 hours after surgery.\n- Two co-primary endpoints were assessed.\n- The first endpoint assessed was the mean change of pneumocephalus volume.\n- The second endpoint assessed was the air resorption rate in 24 hours.\n- Secondary endpoints were evaluated in the study.\n- Subjective alertness was one of the secondary endpoints.\n- Subjective alertness was measured using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.\n- Subjective alertness was evaluated postoperatively.\n- Attention was another secondary endpoint.\n- Attention was measured using the Stroop test.\n- Attention was evaluated preoperatively.\n- Attention was also evaluated 24 hours after surgery.\n- There was a study or experiment involving patients with pneumocephalus.\n- The patients were divided into a treatment arm and a control arm.\n- The mean change in pneumocephalus volume was measured in these patients.\n- The mean change in pneumocephalus volume was higher in patients in the treatment arm.\n- The mean change in pneumocephalus volume was lower in patients in the control arm.\n- The difference in mean change in pneumocephalus volume between the treatment arm and control arm was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.001.\n- There were patients in a control arm.\n- The air resorption rate was higher in patients in the treatment arm.\n- The air resorption rate was lower in patients in the control arm.\n- The difference in air resorption rate between the treatment arm and control arm was statistically significant (p = 0.0015).\n- The group of patients in which differences were more pronounced were aged 52 years and older.\n- There are patients in a control arm.\n- The Stroop test was administered to both groups.\n- The results of the Stroop test were compared between the two groups.\n- No difference was observed in the Stroop test results between the treatment arm and the control arm.\n- The scores were distributed on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.\n- There was a difference in mean values.\n- The p-value for the difference in mean values was 0.015.\n- Normobaric hyperoxia is administered at FiO2 100%.\n- The administration is done via an endotracheal tube.\n- The administration lasts for 3 hours.\n- This method is used in the treatment of pneumocephalus.\n- The treatment is applied after posterior fossa surgery.\n- The surgery is performed in the semisitting position.\n- The administration of normobaric hyperoxia is efficacious.\n- The register has an entry with the identifier DRKS00006273.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
