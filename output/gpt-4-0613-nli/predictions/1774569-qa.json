There are a number of detoxification agents but no recommended drug of choice. The purpose of this study is to compare buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for detoxification from illicit opiates in primary care.\n\nMETHODS.\nOpen label randomised controlled trial in NHS Primary Care (General Practices), Leeds, UK. Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six months post detoxification were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nOnly 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Risk of non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35\u20130.96, p = 0.065). A higher proportion of people allocated to buprenorphine provided a clean urine sample compared with those who received dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33\u20133.21, p = 0.028). People allocated to buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and more were abstinent at three months (10 vs 4, RR 1.55 CI 0.96\u20132.52) and six months post detoxification (7 vs 3, RR 1.45 CI 0.84\u20132.49).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nInformative randomised trials evaluating routine care within the primary care setting are possible amongst drug using populations. This small study generates unique data on commonly used treatment regimens.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nMany drug users go to their regular doctors asking for help to stop using illegal drugs. There are many medicines available to help with this, but no one is sure which is the best. This study compares two drugs, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which is better at helping people stop using illegal drugs.\n\nMETHODS:\nThis study included 60 adults in Leeds, UK, who were using illegal drugs and wanted to stop. They were randomly chosen to receive either buprenorphine or dihydrocodeine. The way the drugs were reduced over time depended on what the prescribing doctor thought was best, but it was not supposed to be more than 15 days. The main goal was to see if the person stopped using illegal drugs by the end of the treatment, which was checked by a urine test. They also looked at what happened during the treatment and three and six months afterwards.\n\nRESULTS:\nOnly 23% of the people finished their drug detox treatment and gave a urine sample at the end. If people were given buprenorphine, they were more likely to finish the detox treatment. Those given buprenorphine were also more likely to have a clean urine sample, meaning they stopped using illegal drugs. They also needed to see healthcare professionals less often during treatment and more were still not using drugs three and six months later.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nWith help, it is possible to set up good quality trials in the regular healthcare setting for people using drugs. This small study provides completely new data on how to use these treatments.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The detoxification requested by these drug users is from illicit opiates.\n- These drug users present to primary care for their detoxification request.\n- There is no recommended drug of choice for detoxification.\n- The study is conducted in the context of primary care.\n- The trial is open label.\n- The trial is conducted in NHS Primary Care.\n- The location of the trial is General Practices in Leeds, UK.\n- All participants in the study were consenting.\n- The participants received either sublingual buprenorphine or oral dihydrocodeine.\n- The medication was administered daily.\n- Buprenorphine was administered sublingually.\n- Dihydrocodeine was administered orally.\n- The urine sample was collected on collection of their final prescription.\n- The reduction in risk was from 88% to 68%.\n- The relative risk (RR) was 0.58.\n- The confidence interval (CI) was between 0.35 and 0.96.\n- The p-value was 0.065.\n- The proportion of people who provided a clean urine sample was 21% for those allocated to buprenorphine.\n- The proportion of people who provided a clean urine sample was 3% for those who received dihydrocodeine.\n- The relative risk (RR) of providing a clean urine sample for those on buprenorphine compared to those on dihydrocodeine was 2.06.\n- The confidence interval (CI) for this relative risk was 1.33\u20133.21.\n- The p-value for this comparison was 0.028.\n- The p-value indicates that the difference in proportions is statistically significant.\n- The number of people abstinent at three months was 10 for those on buprenorphine versus 4 for others.\n- The relative risk (RR) of abstinence at three months for those on buprenorphine was 1.55.\n- The confidence interval (CI) for the RR of abstinence at three months for those on buprenorphine was 0.96\u20132.52.\n- The number of people abstinent at six months was 7 for those on buprenorphine versus 3 for others.\n- The relative risk (RR) of abstinence at six months for those on buprenorphine was 1.45.\n- The study focuses on commonly used treatment regimens.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
