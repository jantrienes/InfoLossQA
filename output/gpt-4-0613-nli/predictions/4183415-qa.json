In this cluster randomized trial in drug shops in Tanzania, 42 of 82 selected shops were randomized to receive text message reminders about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Eligible patients purchasing AL at shops in both arms were followed up at home and questioned about each dose taken. Dispensers were interviewed regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices and receipt of the malaria-related text messages. We interviewed 904 patients and 110 dispensers from 77 shops. Although there was some improvement in dispenser knowledge, there was no difference between arms in adherence measured as completion of all doses (intervention 68.3%, control 69.8%, p [adjusted] = 0.6), or as completion of each dose at the correct time (intervention 33.1%, control 32.6%, p [adjusted] = 0.9). Further studies on the potential of text messages to improve adherence are needed.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looked at whether text message reminders sent to drug store staff in Tanzania would help patients take all their doses of a malaria drug called Artemether-Lumefantrine. 904 patients and 110 drug store staff members from 77 stores participated. The stores were divided into two groups. In one group, the staff members received text message reminders about how to give advice to patients using the drug. \n\nThe findings show that while there was some improvement in the drug store staff's knowledge, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the patients completing all their doses or taking each dose at the right time. This means that the text message reminders did not change the patients' behavior concerning taking their medication properly. \n\nMore studies are needed to see if text messages can be used effectively to improve how patients adhere to their medication schedules.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Artemisinin combination therapies are available in private outlets.\n- The potential compromise of patient adherence might be due to poor advice from dispensers.\n- The text message reminders were about what advice to provide when dispensing artemether-lumefantrine (AL).\n- The trial was a cluster randomized trial.\n- The eligible patients were followed up at home.\n- The patients were questioned about each dose taken.\n- The follow-up involves questioning about each dose of AL taken.\n- Dispensers were interviewed.\n- The interview was regarding knowledge of AL dispensing practices.\n- The interview was also about receipt of malaria-related text messages.\n- 904 patients were interviewed.\n- The interviews took place at 77 shops.\n- The completion rate of all doses in the intervention group was 68.3%.\n- The completion rate of all doses in the control group was 69.8%.\n- The adjusted p-value for the difference in completion of all doses between the groups was 0.6.\n- The completion rate of each dose at the correct time in the intervention group was 33.1%.\n- The completion rate of each dose at the correct time in the control group was 32.6%.\n- The adjusted p-value for the difference in completion of each dose at the correct time between the groups was 0.9.\n- The goal of these studies is to improve adherence.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
