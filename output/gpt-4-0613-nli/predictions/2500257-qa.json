This was confirmed by a p-value of 0.05, a commonly used threshold in scientific studies, indicating that there was only a 5% possibility that the result was due to chance.\n\n- Fact: The median reduction in antibiotic use was 2.5 days.\n- Question: By how much were the patients able to reduce their use of antibiotics?\n- Answer: On average, patients were able to reduce their use of antibiotics by 2.5 days.\n\n- Fact: The reduction in antibiotic use was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.01.\n- Question: How can we be sure that the reduction in antibiotic use was not just a random event?\n- Answer: The reduction in antibiotic use was confirmed to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.01. This means there is only a 1% chance that this reduction occurred by chance, suggesting a high level of confidence in the result."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens": 497, "total_tokens": 1012}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 2048, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nFluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (PNA-FISH) differentiates Staphylococcus aureus from other Gram-positive-cocci in clusters (GPCC). 101/202 patients with GPCC+ blood cultures were randomly assigned to clinician-notification of PNA FISH results. Notification was associated with reduced mortality (8% vs.17%, p = 0.05), further antibiotic use (median \u22122.5 days, p = 0.01), and trended toward reduced hospital stay and charges.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study is about a test called PNA-FISH, which can tell the difference between a specific bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, and other similar bacteria in blood samples. Out of 202 patients with positive blood cultures, half were randomly chosen to have their test results shared with their doctor. Those who had their test results shared had a lower death rate (8% compared to 17%) and used fewer antibiotics (about 2.5 days less). They also showed a tendency to have shorter hospital stays and lower medical bills.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Fluorescence in situ hybridization uses peptide nucleic acid probes.\n- The other bacteria are Gram-positive-cocci in clusters (GPCC).\n- Staphylococcus aureus is different from other Gram-positive-cocci in clusters.\n- The difference in mortality rates was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.05.\n- The median reduction in antibiotic use was 2.5 days.\n- The reduction in antibiotic use was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.01.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\"). For each fact, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text (\"Original\"). Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time. Do this for all facts, and format your output as follows:\n\n- Fact:\n- Question:\n- Answer:"}]}
