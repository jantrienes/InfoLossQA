This method helps prevent bias in the results.\n\n- Fact: The trials were conducted at six separate centers.\n- Question: At how many different locations were the trials conducted?\n- Answer: The trials were conducted at six separate centers.\n\n- Fact: The CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis was used in the trials.\n- Question: What model was used in the trials to induce allergic responses?\n- Answer: The trials used the CAC (Conjunctival Allergen Challenge) model of allergic conjunctivitis. This is a method where an allergy-causing substance is applied directly to the eye to induce symptoms.\n\n- Fact: Ocular itching was reported at 5 minutes.\n- Question: How soon after exposure to the allergen was itching reported?\n- Answer: Ocular itching was reported as early as 5 minutes after exposure to the allergen.\n\n- Fact: Conjunctival hyperemia was assessed as part of the primary ocular end points.\n- Question: Which parameters were assessed as part of the primary outcomes of the study?\n- Answer: Conjunctival hyperemia, which is an excessive amount of blood vessels in the eye leading to a red appearance, was assessed as part of the primary outcomes.\n\n- Fact: Secondary ocular end points included chemosis.\n- Question: What other eye symptoms were observed as secondary outcomes in the study?\n- Answer: Chemosis, which is the swelling of the conjunctiva (the clear tissue covering the white part of the eye), was one of the secondary outcomes observed in the study.\n\n- Fact: The P value for the reduction in ocular itching was less than 0.0001.\n- Question: How significant was the reduction in ocular itching?\n- Answer: The reduction in ocular itching was statistically significant with a P value of less than 0.0001. A P value is a measure of probability in statistics. A P value less than 0.05 is often considered significant, so a value less than 0.0001 is highly significant.\n\n- Fact: The onset and 8-hour persistence of action reached clinical significance at a majority of time points.\n- Question: How effective was the eye drop over time?\n- Answer: The onset, which is how quickly the treatment started working, and the persistence of action, which measures how long the treatment continued to work, both showed clinical significance at most of the time points. This implies the eye drop started working quickly and the effects lasted for at least 8 hours.\n\n- Fact: BBOS 1.5% was used to treat CAC-induced ocular itching.\n- Question: What was the main symptom the BBOS 1.5% eyedrop aimed to alleviate? \n- Answer: The BBOS 1.5% eyedrop was primarily used in the clinical trials to treat ocular itching induced by a Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC), a method used to trigger allergy symptoms in the eye for study purposes."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1169, "completion_tokens": 697, "total_tokens": 1866}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nPURPOSE.\nTo examine the pooled per-protocol ocular end points from two conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) clinical trials of the dual-action antihistamine bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution (BBOS) 1.5%.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at a total of six separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1.5% (n=78) or placebo (n=79) treatment. Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7 minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20 minutes following each CAC. Secondary ocular end points included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators, and tearing (scored as either absent or present) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects.\n\nRESULTS.\nA statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1.5% treatment compared to placebo at all time points (P<0.0001), while measures for onset and 8-hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, \u22651.0 unit difference) at a majority of time points. In addition, a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia was achieved at a majority of time points during the onset of action CAC test. Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo, most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8-hour study visits. Adverse events were generally mild and transient.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBBOS 1.5% rapidly reduced CAC-induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8 hours after dosing. Certain secondary signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced.\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess how effective a new antihistamine eye drop (BBOS 1.5%) is at treating eye allergy symptoms.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe research team conducted two trials with the same design involving 157 participants, either using the antihistamine drop (78 participants) or a placebo (79 participants). The participants were given a drop in both eyes during different visits, either 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours before being exposed to a common eye allergen. The main traits measured were changes in eye itching and redness at various time intervals after the exposure. Other measurements including swelling, tearing, and other forms of redness were also considered.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe findings showed a significant reduction in eye itching for those using the antihistamine drop compared to those using the placebo. This reduction was noticed at all time points, and was found to last for at least 8 hours. Additionally, a decrease in redness and other secondary signs of inflammation was noted. Any side effects that participants experienced were generally mild and short-lived.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn conclusion, the antihistamine eye drop, BBOS 1.5%, was found to be efficient in promptly reducing allergy symptoms in the eye, such as itching and redness, for at least 8 hours after application. Other signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Two Phase III clinical trials were conducted.\n- The trials were double-masked.\n- The trials were conducted at six separate centers.\n- The CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis was used in the trials.\n- Ocular itching was reported at 5 minutes.\n- Ocular itching was reported at 7 minutes.\n- Conjunctival hyperemia was assessed as part of the primary ocular end points.\n- Conjunctival hyperemia was assessed at 7 minutes.\n- Conjunctival hyperemia was assessed at 15 minutes.\n- Conjunctival hyperemia was assessed at 20 minutes.\n- Secondary ocular end points included chemosis.\n- Secondary ocular end points included episcleral and ciliary hyperemia.\n- Episcleral and ciliary hyperemia were judged by investigators.\n- The P value for the reduction in ocular itching was less than 0.0001.\n- The onset and 8-hour persistence of action reached clinical significance at a majority of time points.\n- There was a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia.\n- The time points were during the onset of action CAC test.\n- BBOS 1.5% was used to treat CAC-induced ocular itching.\n- The ocular itching was induced by CAC.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
