Many women do not breastfeed, or they stop early.\n\n- Fact: Public health efforts have been made to increase breastfeeding rates.\n- Question: Have there been any efforts to encourage more mothers to breastfeed?\n- Answer: Yes, there have been public health campaigns and initiatives aimed at encouraging more mothers to breastfeed their newborn babies.\n\n- Fact: Despite these efforts, breastfeeding rates have not significantly increased.\n- Question: Despite these public health efforts, have breastfeeding rates increased significantly?\n- Answer: Unfortunately, despite these efforts, the rates of breastfeeding have not seen a significant increase.\n\n- Fact: The rate of exclusive or any breastfeeding will be measured at discharge, 3 and 6 months of age.\n- Question: When will the rate of breastfeeding be measured during the study?\n- Answer: In our study, we measure the rate of breastfeeding at three different times: when the mom and baby leave the hospital, when the baby is three months old, and when the baby is six months old.\n\n- Fact: The infants were randomly assigned to different groups.\n- Question: How were the babies divided into the two groups?\n- Answer: The babies were randomly assigned to two groups. This means the researchers let chance decide which group each baby went into, ensuring the groups were as similar as possible.\n\n- Fact: The CLF intervention involved giving 10 ml of formula by syringe after each breastfeeding.\n- Question: What exactly did the CLF intervention entail?\n- Answer: During the CLF intervention, each baby was given a small amount of baby formula (10 ml) after every breastfeeding session. This was given using a syringe.\n\n- Fact: The CLF intervention was discontinued at the onset of lactation.\n- Question: How long did the CLF intervention last?\n- Answer: The CLF intervention lasted only until the mothers started producing their own milk, which is known as the onset of lactation.\n\n- Fact: The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing.\n- Question: Were precautions taken when analyzing statistical data in the study?\n- Answer: Yes, the 'p-values' were adjusted for 'multiple testing'. P-value is a measure used in statistics that helps researchers determine if their findings are important. Adjusting for multiple testing means they've taken precautions to ensure their findings are still accurate even though they've done many statistical tests.\n\n- Fact: Fifty newborns were analyzed in CLF.\n- Question: How many newborns were analyzed in the CLF group?\n- Answer: Fifty newborns were analyzed in the CLF group.\n\n- Fact: The study also looked at rates of any breastfeeding.\n- Question: Did the study only look at exclusive breastfeeding rates?\n- Answer: No, the study looked at any instance of breastfeeding, not just exclusive breastfeeding.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the rates of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was 0.2.\n- Question: What was the p-value for exclusive breastfeeding rates when the mothers and babies left the hospital?\n- Answer: The p-value for exclusive breastfeeding rates at this time was 0.2.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the rates of any breastfeeding at discharge was >0.99.\n- Question: What was the p-value for the rates of any breastfeeding at the time of discharge from the hospital?\n- Answer: The p-value for the rates of any breastfeeding at the time the mom and baby left the hospital was more than 0.99. \n\n- Fact: The weight loss was measured in percentages.\n- Question: How did the researchers measure the newborns' weight loss during the study?\n- Answer: The researchers recorded the weight loss of the newborns as a percentage of their birth weight.\n\n- Fact: The CLF group had a 7.3% weight loss during hospitalisation.\n- Question: How much weight, on average, did the infants in the CLF group lose while they were in the hospital?\n- Answer: The newborns in the CLF group lost an average of 7.3% of their birth weight during their time in the hospital.\n\n- Fact: The SA group had an 8.4% weight loss during hospitalisation.\n- Question: How much weight, on average, did the infants in the SA group lose while they were in the hospital?\n- Answer: The newborns in the SA group lost an average of 8.4% of their birth weight during their time in the hospital.\n\n- Fact: The difference in weight loss between the SA group and the CLF group was statistically significant.\n- Question: Was there a significant difference in weight loss between the two groups of newborns?\n- Answer: Yes, there was a statistically significant difference in weight loss between the two groups. This means the difference was not likely due to chance.\n\n- Fact: The p-value of the difference in weight loss between the two groups was 0.002.\n- Question: How significant was the difference in weight loss between the two groups?\n- Answer: The difference in weight loss between the two groups was quite significant. The p-value was 0.002, which indicates a strong evidence that the weight loss in the two groups was not due to chance."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1186, "completion_tokens": 1135, "total_tokens": 2321}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nOBJECTIVES.\nBreastfeeding is known to reduce infant morbidity and improve well-being. Nevertheless, breastfeeding rates remain low despite public health efforts. Our study aims to investigate the effect of controlled limited formula usage during birth hospitalisation on breastfeeding, using the primary hypothesis that early limited formula feeds in infants with early weight loss will not adversely affect the rate of exclusive or any breastfeeding as measured at discharge, 3 and 6 months of age.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nWe randomly assigned 104 healthy term infants, 24 to 48 hours old, with \u2265 5% loss of birth weight to controlled limited formula (CLF) intervention (10 ml formula by syringe after each breastfeeding, discontinued at onset of lactation) or control group (standard approach, SA). Groups were compared for demographic data and breastfeeding rates at discharge, 3 months and 6 months of age (p-values adjusted for multiple testing).\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty newborns were analysed in CLF and 50 in SA group. There were no differences in demographic data or clinical characteristics between groups. We found no evidence of difference between treatment groups in the rates of exclusive as well as any breastfeeding at discharge (p-value 0.2 and >0.99 respectively), 3 months (p-value 0.12 and 0.10) and 6 months of infants\u2019 age (p-value 0.45 and 0.34 respectively). The percentage weight loss during hospitalisation was significantly higher in the SA group (7.3% in CLF group, 8.4% in SA group, p = 0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study shows that controlled limited formula use does not have an adverse effect on rates of breastfeeding in the short and long term. Larger studies are needed to confirm a possible potential in controlled limited formula use to support establishing breastfeeding and to help to improve the rates of breastfeeding overall.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nISRCTN registry ISRCTN61915183\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL OF THE STUDY.\nBreastfeeding is good for a baby's health and overall wellbeing-- but not enough women do it. We wanted to see if giving newborns a small amount of baby formula right after birth would hurt or help breastfeeding rates. We also wanted to know whether this approach would hinder breastfeeding when the baby is three or six months old.\n\nHOW THE STUDY WAS DONE.\nWe picked 104 healthy babies that had lost more than 5% of their birth weight and were between one and two days old. We split them into two groups. In one group, we gave the babies 10 ml of baby formula feed after each breastfeeding session (this was stopped as soon as the mother's milk came in). The other group followed the standard approach. We tracked breastfeeding rates when the babies left the hospital, and then checked in when they were three and six months old.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nIn both groups, 50 newborns were examined. The groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical characteristics. There was no noticeable difference in breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge, at three months, or at six months between the two groups. One thing that did differ, was the amount of weight the babies lost in the hospital - babies in the standard approach lost more weight.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS.\nOur study shows that giving newborns a small amount of baby formula feed doesn't seem to hurt breastfeeding rates in the short or long term. More studies need to be done to see if this approach can help more moms breastfeed and keep breastfeeding for longer.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS.\nThe study is registered with the ISRCTN under the number ISRCTN61915183.\n\n\n## Missing facts\n- Breastfeeding is known to reduce infant morbidity.\n- Breastfeeding rates are low.\n- Public health efforts have been made to increase breastfeeding rates.\n- Despite these efforts, breastfeeding rates have not significantly increased.\n- The rate of exclusive or any breastfeeding will be measured at discharge, 3 and 6 months of age.\n- The infants were randomly assigned to different groups.\n- The CLF intervention involved giving 10 ml of formula by syringe after each breastfeeding.\n- The CLF intervention was discontinued at the onset of lactation.\n- The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing.\n- Fifty newborns were analysed in CLF.\n- The study also looked at rates of any breastfeeding.\n- The p-value for the rates of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was 0.2.\n- The p-value for the rates of any breastfeeding at discharge was >0.99.\n- The weight loss was measured in percentages.\n- The CLF group had a 7.3% weight loss during hospitalisation.\n- The SA group had an 8.4% weight loss during hospitalisation.\n- The difference in weight loss between the SA group and the CLF group was statistically significant.\n- The p-value of the difference in weight loss between the two groups was 0.002.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
