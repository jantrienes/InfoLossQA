Group 1 consisted of 14 listeners (number of females\u2009=\u200911) who were 41\u201361 years old [mean\u2009=\u200953.18; standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u20095.97]. Group 2 consisted of 15 listeners (number of females\u2009=\u20099) who were 63\u201381 years old (mean\u2009=\u200972.07; SD\u2009=\u20095.11). Participants were administered the WCJ-III Memory for Words, Auditory Working Memory, Visual Matching, and Decision Speed subtests. All participants were tested in each of the following three dual-task experimental conditions, which were varying in complexity: (1) auditory word recognition\u2009+\u2009visual processing, (2) auditory working memory (word)\u2009+\u2009visual processing, and (3) auditory working memory (sentence)\u2009+\u2009visual processing in noise.\n\nRESULTS.\nA repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that task complexity significantly affected the performance measures of auditory accuracy, visual accuracy, and processing speed. Linear regression revealed that the cognitive subtests of the WCJ-III test significantly predicted performance across dependent variable measures.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nListening effort is significantly affected by task complexity, regardless of age. Performance on the WCJ-III test may predict listening effort in adults and may assist speech-language pathologist (SLPs) to understand challenges faced by participants when subjected to noise.\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis study aims to establish if a test we often use to assess thinking skills can also help us understand how hard adults of different ages find it to listen and do something else at the same time.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe had two groups of volunteers. The first group, made up of 14 people mostly women (11 out of 14), were aged between 41 and 61 years. The second group had 15 people, only nine women, aged between 63 and 81. We asked these people to do a few tests from the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III. This is an assessment tool we typically use to evaluate how the brain processes information. Then our volunteers had to do two tasks at the same time. These tasks were a bit different for each round, but the idea was always the same: listen to something while also watching something.\n\nRESULTS.\nLooking at the results, it became clear that the difficulty of the task influences how well people did in terms of hearing accurately, seeing accurately, and how quickly they processed information. Additionally, the certain thinking-related subtests from the taken test could potentially help predict how well people performed in complex tests.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIt turns out that the more difficult the task, the harder it can be for anyone, regardless of their age, to listen and do another task at the same time. Also, the better someone does on the specific Woodcock\u2013Johnson III test, the easier they might find doing two things at once. This information may help speech-language experts understand the problems individuals might run into when there's background noise.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The mean age of the listeners in Group 1 was 53.18 years.\n- The subtests included the WCJ-III Memory for Words.\n- The subtests included Auditory Working Memory.\n- The subtests included Visual Matching.\n- The subtests included Decision Speed.\n- Participants were tested in three dual-task experimental conditions.\n- The first experimental condition was auditory word recognition and visual processing.\n- The second experimental condition was auditory working memory (word) and visual processing.\n- The third experimental condition was auditory working memory (sentence) and visual processing in noise.\n- The auditory tasks in the conditions involved either word recognition or working memory.\n- The visual task in all conditions was visual processing.\n- A repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted.\n- Linear regression was used in the analysis.\n- The WCJ-III test is used in the context of speech-language pathology.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
