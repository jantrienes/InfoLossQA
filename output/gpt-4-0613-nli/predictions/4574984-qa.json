This means looking at how well someone is able to carry out daily activities and their level of physical, psychological, and social well-being a year after surgery.\n\n- Fact: The assessment of HRQoL used the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire.\n- Question: How did researchers measure the health-related quality of life in this study?\n- Answer: The researchers used the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire to measure health-related quality of life. This is a tool used to assess the general health status of cancer patients.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the difference in global HRQoL after one year between the intervention and control groups for women was 0.54.\n- Question: According to the study, was there a significant difference in the health-related quality of life after one year for women in the two groups?\n- Answer: No, there was not a significant difference in health-related quality of life after one year for women in either group. The p-value was 0.54, and anything above 0.05 is considered not significant in statistical terms.\n\n- Fact: The difference in reported postoperative pain between the two groups is statistically significant.\n- Question: Was there a significant difference in reported pain after surgery between the two groups?\n- Answer: Yes, there was a statistically significant difference in reported pain post-surgery between the group that received the information booklet and kept a diary and the group that received usual care. Specifically, the intervention group reported less pain.\n\n- Fact: Severity of surgery is an independent predictor for LOS.\n- Question: What is one factor that can predict how long a patient might stay in the hospital after surgery?\n- Answer: The severity of the surgery can predict how long a patient might stay in the hospital after surgery. That means, a more complex surgery might lead to a longer hospital stay.\n\n- Fact: Nutritional state is an independent predictor for LOS.\n- Question: What is another factor that could predict the length of hospital stay after surgery?\n- Answer: The nutritional state of a patient prior to surgery could predict the length of hospital stay. In other words, if a patient is not well-nourished before surgery, they might need to stay in the hospital longer.\n\n- Fact: The Timed Up and Go-test is used to measure pre-operative physical functional capacity.\n- Question: How did researchers measure the physical ability of patients before surgery?\n- Answer: Researchers used the Timed Up and Go test to measure the physical ability of patients before surgery. This test measures how long it takes for a person to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. It is used to assess a person's mobility and balance.\n\n- Fact: These predictors were identified by multiple robust regressions.\n- Question: How were these predictors for the length of hospital stay identified?\n- Answer: These predictors for the length of hospital stay were identified using statistical methods, specifically multiple robust regressions. This is a type of statistical analysis that highlights relationships between different factors.\n\n- Fact: The patients in the study were onco-surgical patients.\n- Question: What type of patients were included in this study?\n- Answer: This study included onco-surgical patients.

The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 \u00b1 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7\u201314 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPatient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicaltrials.gov. Identifier NCT01278537\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis research was designed to see if educating older cancer patients about their surgery would affect their recovery time or their health and quality of life one year after their procedure.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween February 2011 and January 2014, the research took place in two major medical centers in Germany. We had patients who were 65 years or older who were getting surgery for stomach, urinary, and chest cancer. We randomly put these patients into two groups. One group received an information booklet and kept a diary\u2014a way to give more power to the patient. The other group was given the usual care. We measured how long they had to stay in the hospital after their surgery and their health and life quality after a year. We also looked at their stress and any complications after surgery. Lastly, we wanted to identify any factors that could predict their hospital stay and life quality at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had 652 patients with an average age of around 72, and most were men. On average, patients stayed in the hospital for 9 days after their surgery. There wasn't a significant difference in hospital stay or life quality after a year between the two groups. While three out of four people had some kind of complication after the surgery, the frequency and severity were the same in both groups. However, those who received the information booklet and kept a diary reported having less pain after their surgery. The factors that determined how long patients stayed in the hospital were how severe the surgery was, how long the anesthesia lasted, any major complications after surgery, a patient's nutrition level, and their physical ability before surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nGiving patients more information about their surgery and having them keep a diary did not shorten their hospital stay. However, it did result in less reported pain after surgery. How long a patient had to stay in the hospital was determined by their nutrition level, physical ability, the severity of the surgery, and how long the anesthesia lasted.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT01278537.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The medical centers are tertiary centers.\n- The patients were undergoing elective surgery.\n- The elective surgery was for gastro-intestinal cancer.\n- The elective surgery was for genitourinary cancer.\n- The elective surgery was for thoracic cancer.\n- The primary outcome also includes long-term global health-related quality of life.\n- The assessment of HRQoL used the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire.\n- The p-value for the difference in global HRQoL after one year between the intervention and control groups for women was 0.54.\n- The difference in reported postoperative pain between the two groups is statistically significant.\n- Severity of surgery is an independent predictor for LOS.\n- Nutritional state is an independent predictor for LOS.\n- The Timed Up and Go-test is used to measure pre-operative physical functional capacity.\n- These predictors were identified by multiple robust regressions.\n- The patients in the study were onco-surgical patients.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
