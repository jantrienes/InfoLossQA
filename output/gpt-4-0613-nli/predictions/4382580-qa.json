Ten patients were randomized into two groups: aquatic physiotherapy with a mean age of 42 years (range: 25\u201367) and conventional physiotherapy with a mean age of 49 years (range: 43\u201359). Both groups were submitted to a twelve-week program of two sessions weekly.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the intervention, significant improvements were observed regarding the Lequesne index (p-value = 0.0217), Oswestry Disability Index (p-value = 0.0112), range of motion of trunk extension (p-value = 0.0320), trunk flexion muscle strength (p-value = 0.0459), hip extension and abduction muscle strength (p-value = 0.0062 and p-value = 0.0257, respectively). Range of motion of trunk and hip flexion, extension, adduction and abduction, trunk extensor muscle strength and all surface electromyography variables showed no significant statistical difference.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPhysical therapy is efficient to treat musculoskeletal dysfunctions in sickle cell disease patients, irrespective of the technique; however, aquatic therapy showed a trend toward improvement in muscle strength. Further studies with a larger patient sample and longer periods of therapy are necessary to confirm these results.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL:\nWe wanted to see whether exercises in water or on land would be better at reducing hip and lower back pain, and improving overall fitness in patients with sickle cell disease, an illness that affects the red blood cells.\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nAll volunteers agreed to be a part of the study and took several physical tests. We examined things like pain levels, flexibility, strength, and muscle activity. We divided ten patients into two groups: one did water exercises and the other did normal gym exercises. Both groups had two sessions a week for twelve weeks.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nAfter the twelve weeks, both groups saw improvements in pain levels, flexibility, and strength. However, there was no notable difference in improvement between the two groups. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nPhysical exercise, whether it's done in water or on land, can help to treat muscle problems in patients with sickle cell disease. It did seem like the water exercises were slightly better for improving muscle strength, but we would need to study more people over a longer time to know for sure.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The comparison also includes their effect on increasing overall physical capabilities.\n- Informed written consent was obtained from all volunteers.\n- The evaluations used different functional scales.\n- Lequesne's Algofunctional Questionnaire was used in the evaluations.\n- Oswestry Disability Index was used in the evaluations.\n- Goniometry was used in the evaluations.\n- A load cell was used for muscle strength assessment.\n- The other group underwent conventional physiotherapy.\n- The mean age of the aquatic physiotherapy group was 42 years.\n- The age range of the aquatic physiotherapy group was 25 to 67 years.\n- The mean age of the conventional physiotherapy group was 49 years.\n- The age range of the conventional physiotherapy group was 43 to 59 years.\n- After the intervention, there were significant improvements in the Lequesne index.\n- The p-value for the improvement in the Lequesne index was 0.0217.\n- After the intervention, there were significant improvements in the Oswestry Disability Index.\n- The p-value for the improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index was 0.0112.\n- After the intervention, there were significant improvements in the range of motion of trunk extension.\n- The p-value for the improvement in the range of motion of trunk extension was 0.0320.\n- After the intervention, there were significant improvements in trunk flexion muscle strength.\n- The p-value for the improvement in trunk flexion muscle strength was 0.0459.\n- The range of motion of trunk flexion showed no significant statistical difference.\n- The range of motion of trunk extension showed no significant statistical difference.\n- The range of motion of hip flexion showed no significant statistical difference.\n- The range of motion of hip extension showed no significant statistical difference.\n- The range of motion of adduction showed no significant statistical difference.\n- The range of motion of abduction showed no significant statistical difference.\n- The trunk extensor muscle strength showed no significant statistical difference.\n- All surface electromyography variables showed no significant statistical difference.\n- Physical therapy is efficient to treat musculoskeletal dysfunctions in sickle cell disease patients.\n- The further studies need a larger patient sample.\n- The further studies need longer periods of therapy.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
