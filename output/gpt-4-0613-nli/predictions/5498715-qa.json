Chronic diseases are long-term illnesses that often progress slowly, such as heart disease or diabetes.\n\n- Fact: The trial is a randomized controlled trial.\n- Question: What type of research study was conducted?\n- Answer: The research used a randomized controlled trial. This is a type of scientific experiment that randomly assigns participants to two or more groups to receive different interventions or treatments and compares outcomes to see if any difference is due to the interventions.\n\n- Fact: The questionnaire included a physical fitness test.\n- Question: What type of assessments did the questionnaire include?\n- Answer: The questionnaire included assessments of physical fitness, which measures how well a person can perform physical activity or exercises.\n\n- Fact: The questionnaire included a global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ).\n- Question: What purpose does the global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) serve in the questionnaire? \n- Answer: The global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) is a tool used to assess an individual's physical activity levels across various domains, such as work, travel, and leisure.\n\n- Fact: The approval of the questionnaires' validity used content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI).\n- Question: How was the validity of the questionnaires ensured?\n- Answer: The validity of the questionnaires was ensured using two measures known as the content validity ratio (CVR) and the content validity index (CVI). These measures help to check that the questionnaire is appropriate and relevant for what it's intended to measure.\n\n- Fact: Cronbach's alpha test was used to approve the internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures.\n- Question: How was the reliability of the questionnaires ensured?\n- Answer: The reliability of the questionnaires was tested using Cronbach's alpha test. This is a statistical measure used to ensure that all parts of the questionnaire are consistently measuring the same thing.\n\n- Fact: The education session received by the control group was standard.\n- Question: What kind of education session did the control group receive?\n- Answer: The control group received a standard education session about exercise. This typically covers basic information on the importance of physical activity and how to incorporate it into daily life.\n\n- Fact: The intervention led to an increase in the mean scores of total PA four months after it was implemented.\n- Question: What was the result of the intervention on total physical activity (PA) a few months following its implementation?\n- Answer: Four months after the intervention, there was an increase in the average measures of total physical activity among the women in the motivational interviewing group.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the increase in total PA was less than 0.001. \n- Question: Was the increase in total physical activity (PA) statistically significant?\n- Answer: Yes, the increase in total physical activity was statistically significant, as indicated by a very low p-value of less than 0.001. A low p-value generally means the result is strong evidence against the null hypothesis and the difference observed is unlikely due to random chance.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the increase in flexibility was less than 0.001.\n- Question: Was the increase in flexibility observed in the participants statistically significant?\n- Answer: Yes, the increase in flexibility was statistically significant, as indicated by a p-value of less than 0.001. This means the observed increase was likely due to the intervention and not chance.\n\n- Fact: The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation.\n- Question: What effect did the intervention have on the women's intrinsic motivation?\n- Answer: After the intervention, the women who were part of the motivational interviewing reported an increase in their intrinsic motivation for exercise. Intrinsic motivation refers to the internal desire to perform a certain behavior because it is inherently satisfying or rewarding.\n\n- Fact: The intervention was effective.\n- Question: Was the motivational interviewing intervention effective?\n- Answer: Yes, the motivational interviewing intervention was found to be effective in promoting physical activity among women of child-bearing age.\n\n- Fact: The Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial has a website.\n- Question: Where can the official registration of the study be found?\n- Answer: The study was officially registered on the website of the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1528, "completion_tokens": 890, "total_tokens": 2418}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND.\nPhysical activity (PA) prevents chronic diseases. Self-determination theory (SDT) provides a useful framework to understand the nature of motivational interviewing (MI).\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study aimed to determine the effect of MI-based intervention using SDT on the promotion of PA among women in reproductive age.\n\nMETHODS.\nSeventy women in reproductive age were selected by clustering sampling method for this randomized controlled trial. The questionnaire included the variables of physical fitness test, SDT, and global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ). The validity of the questionnaires was approved using content validity ratio (CVR) and index (CVI). The reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures was approved using test-retest method and Cronbach's alpha test, respectively. The intervention group (n=35) received four MI sessions through theory and one standard education session about PA. The control group (n=35) received a standard education session about PA.\n\nRESULTS.\nFour months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of total PA (p<0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility (p<0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p<0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory endurance (p<0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test (p<0.001, ES= \u2212 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p<0.01, ES=\u2212 0.74) was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation (p<0.001, ES=3.34), identified regulation (p<0.001, ES= 1.28), perceptions of competence (p<0.001, ES=0.81) and autonomy (p<0.001, ES=2.01), enjoyment (p<0.001, ES=0.98) and health motives (p<0.01, ES=0.19), health care climate (p<0.001, ES=4.6), and a decreased score of external regulation (p<0.01, ES=\u22120.55) and amotivation (p<0.01, ES= \u22120.56) over time, compared to the control group.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nMI-based intervention using SDT was effective on the promotion of PA.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe Trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial (http://www.irct.ir) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015101924592N1.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nRegular exercise helps to prevent many long-term illnesses. This research uses a theory known as Self-determination theory (SDT) which helps to understand people's motivations for exercise and how to increase their motivation.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe goal of the research was to use a method called motivational interviewing (MI), guided by SDT, to see if it could help encourage more exercise among women of child-bearing age.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study included 70 women fitting these criteria. They were picked using a random method and divided into two groups. All participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about their current levels of physical fitness and motivation for exercise. These questionnaires were tested and approved for reliability. One group (35 women) participated in four motivational interviewing sessions based on the SDT theory and one general education session about exercise. The other group (35 women) just participated in the general education session about exercise.\n\nRESULTS.\nFour months later, the women in the group that attended motivation interviewing sessions were doing significantly more physical activity overall. These women also showed improvements in specific fitness aspects: flexibility, muscular and cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) endurance. They also became less sedentary (inactive). Moreover, these women were more self-motivated to exercise, felt more competent, more in control, enjoyed exercising more, and had more health-driven reasons to exercise than women in the other group.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe research shows that using motivational interviewing based on the Self-determination Theory can successfully encourage women of child-bearing age to exercise more.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study was officially registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The diseases prevented by physical activity are chronic.\n- The trial is a randomized controlled trial.\n- The questionnaire included a physical fitness test.\n- The questionnaire included a global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ).\n- The approval of the questionnaires' validity used content validity ratio (CVR).\n- The approval of the questionnaires' validity used content validity index (CVI).\n- Cronbach's alpha test was used to approve the internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures.\n- The standard education session was about PA.\n- The education session was about PA.\n- The education session received by the control group was standard.\n- The intervention led to an increase in the mean scores of total PA four months after it was implemented.\n- The p-value for the increase in total PA was less than 0.001.\n- The effect size (ES) for the increase in total PA was 4.77.\n- The intervention led to an increase in the mean scores of physical fitness tests including flexibility.\n- The p-value for the increase in flexibility was less than 0.001.\n- The effect size (ES) for the increase in flexibility was 1.59.\n- The intervention led to an increase in the mean scores of muscular endurance.\n- The p-value for the increase in muscular endurance was less than 0.001.\n- The effect size (ES) for the increase in muscular endurance was 2.0.\n- The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation.\n- The p-value for the increase in intrinsic motivation scores is less than 0.001.\n- The effect size (ES) for the increase in intrinsic motivation scores is 3.34.\n- The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of identified regulation.\n- The p-value for the increase in identified regulation scores is less than 0.001.\n- The ES for the increase in identified regulation scores is 1.28.\n- The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of perceptions of competence.\n- The p-value for the increase in perceptions of competence scores is less than 0.001.\n- The ES for the increase in perceptions of competence scores is 0.81.\n- The intervention was effective.\n- The Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial has a website.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
