However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection (group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P<0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Additionally, no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups (all P>0.05). The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P<0.05; E-selectin: P<0.05). The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P<0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P>0.05). Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P<0.001; E-selectin: P<0.05); however, the serum TNF-\u03b1 levels did not differ among groups (all P>0.05). Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C, there were no significant differences among groups (all P>0.05). In conclusion, we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion. Moreover, chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect, but there was no association between H. pylori infection, chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance.\n\n## Simplification\nWe wanted to understand how long-term alcohol intake relates to a specific stomach infection caused by a bacteria called H. pylori. We studied various body responses and inflammation markers in three groups of people, totaling 142 subjects in all. Group A consisted of 59 people who drink alcohol regularly and have the H. pylori infection. Group B had 53 subjects who drink alcohol regularly but do not have the infection. Finally, Group C was the control group of 30 people who neither drink alcohol regularly nor are infected.\n\nBody mass index (BMI), a measure of body size based on height and weight, was generally higher in those who drank alcohol frequently whether infected with H. pylori or not. However, the difference in BMI wasn't significant between those who were infected and those who weren't.\n\nGenerally, certain substances that signify inflammation were different between the groups. For example, lower levels of two inflammation markers, IL-10 and E-selectin, were found in those who drank alcohol and were infected with H. pylori compared to those that weren't infected. Those who drank alcohol but weren't infected showed higher levels of these markers than the control group.\n\nHowever, the levels of another inflammation marker, TNF-\u03b1, were not very different among the groups. Levels of substances that signify cell damage were also not significantly different among the groups.\n\nTo sum it all up, we think that the H. pylori infection might weaken certain inflammation responses in those who drink alcohol regularly. Also, regular alcohol drinking might adjust inflammation levels. However, we found no relationship between the infection or regular alcohol drinking and cell damage.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection is limited.\n- The serum levels of CagA were measured.\n- The serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10 were measured.\n- The serum levels of E-selectin were measured.\n- The serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 were measured.\n- The serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured.\n- The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was measured.\n- The measurements were done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n- The ages among the three groups were matched and comparable.\n- The serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups were matched and comparable.\n- The mean drinking age between groups A and B was matched and comparable.\n- The mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B was matched and comparable.\n- The F-value of the statistical test is 3.921.\n- The significance level of the BMI difference between group A and group C is less than 0.001.\n- The significance level of the BMI difference between group B and group C is less than 0.01.\n- Serum CagA levels were measured in multiple groups.\n- No differences were found in the serum CagA levels among the groups.\n- The differences in serum CagA levels among the groups were not statistically significant (P>0.05).\n- Serum IL-10 levels were measured in both groups.\n- Serum E-selectin levels were measured in both groups.\n- The difference in serum IL-10 levels between group A and group B is statistically significant (P<0.05).\n- The difference in serum E-selectin levels between group A and group B is statistically significant (P<0.05).\n- The serum IL-10 in group A was measured.\n- The serum IL-10 in group C was measured.\n- The difference in serum IL-10 levels between group A and group C was statistically significant (P<0.01).\n- The serum E-selectin levels in group A were measured.\n- The serum E-selectin levels in group C were measured.\n- There was no significant difference in serum E-selectin levels between group A and group C (P>0.05).\n- The serum TNF-\u03b1 levels did not differ among groups.\n- The significance level for the difference in serum IL-10 levels between group B and C was P<0.001.\n- The significance level for the difference in serum E-selectin levels between group B and C was P<0.05.\n- The significance level for the difference in serum TNF-\u03b1 levels among groups was P>0.05.\n- The serum levels of MDA in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C.\n- The serum levels of SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C.\n- There were no significant differences in the serum levels of MDA among groups A, B, and C.\n- There were no significant differences in the serum levels of SOD among groups A, B, and C.\n- The P-value for the differences in serum levels of MDA among the groups is greater than 0.05.\n- The P-value for the differences in serum levels of SOD among the groups is greater than 0.05.\n- H. pylori infection might cause significant inhibition.\n- There is no association between H. pylori infection and oxidative balance.\n- There is no association between chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
