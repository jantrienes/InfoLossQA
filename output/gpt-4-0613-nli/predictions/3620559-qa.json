In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). Stratifying outcomes by anti-Mu\u0308llerian hormone (AMH), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass index (BMI) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (AMH, r (17) = \u22120.20, p = 0.44; BMI, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve (p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes per ovary (z = \u22123.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nNeedle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve. Thinner needles appear to significantly prolong operating time.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nWe wanted to see if the size of the needle used to collect a woman's eggs during in vitro fertilization (IVF) affected the number of eggs we could get.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a test run with 21 women who were likely to have good results. We randomly picked which ovary to use a standard size needle and which to use a thinner needle on.\n\nRESULTS.\nWith the standard needle, we collected 215 eggs from 355 attempts (60.6%). With the thinner needle, we got 203 eggs from 352 attempts (57.7%). A hormone that tells us how many eggs a woman has left didn't change these results, nor did the woman's weight. There also wasn't a difference in results whether a woman had a normal or low amount of eggs left. However, using the thin needle did make the process about 3.3 minutes longer per ovary.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe size of the needle doesn't seem to affect how many eggs we can get, including in overweight women and women with fewer eggs left. But using thinner needles makes the procedure take longer.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The patients were studied consecutively.\n- The patients had a favorable prognosis.\n- The retrieval was done with either a 20 G/ 35 mm needle or a 17 G/ 35 mm needle.\n- The 20 G/ 35 mm needle is considered thin.\n- The 17 G/ 35 mm needle is considered standard.\n- A thinner needle was also used to collect oocytes.\n- The correlation coefficient (r) between BMI and oocyte yield is 0.02.\n- The increase in operating time was significant.\n- This rule applies to obese patients.\n- This rule also applies to patients with diminished ovarian reserve.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
