This means it can help patients maintain a regular treatment schedule or encourage them to make more frequent use of treatment strategies.\n\n- Fact: The text messaging adjunct includes a clinician dashboard to display patient data.\n- Question: Besides sending messages, what other features does the text messaging service have?\n- Answer: The text messaging service also includes a clinician dashboard where patient data is displayed. This means therapists can easily review and monitor their patients' progress.\n\n- Fact: The adjunct includes a daily message reiterating the week's theme.\n- Question: What kinds of messages were included in the text messaging service?\n- Answer: The text messaging service included a range of different messages. One type was a daily message that reiterated the theme for the week's therapy session, helping patients remember and reinforce what they had learned.\n\n- Fact: Mood data was sent to a Web-based platform called HealthySMS.\n- Question: Where was the mood data from the text messaging service sent and stored?\n- Answer: The mood data collected through the text messaging service was sent to a Web-based platform called HealthySMS. This made it easy for therapists to access and review the data.\n\n- Fact: Qualitative responses were sent to HealthySMS.\n- Question: Besides mood data, were there other types of data collected and stored on HealthySMS?\n- Answer: Yes, patients' qualitative responses were also sent and stored on HealthySMS. This means the therapists had access to more comprehensive data on their patients' conditions and experiences.\n\n- Fact: The data sent to HealthySMS was reviewed by a therapist.\n- Question: Who was responsible for reviewing the data that was collected and stored on HealthySMS?\n- Answer: The data that was sent to HealthySMS, including mood data and qualitative responses, was reviewed by a therapist. This allowed the therapist to keep track of the patient's progress and tailor their treatment accordingly.\n\n- Fact: The data was displayed in a session.\n- Question: How was the data collected through the text messaging service and stored on HealthySMS used in therapy sessions?\n- Answer: The data collected through the text messaging service and stored on HealthySMS was displayed in therapy sessions, serving as a useful tool for the therapists to discuss and teach cognitive behavioral therapy skills.\n\n- Fact: The therapy consisted of 16 sessions.\n- Question: How many therapy sessions were included in the treatment program?\n- Answer: The therapy program consisted of 16 sessions.\n\n- Fact: The therapy sessions were held weekly.\n- Question: How frequently were the therapy sessions held in the treatment program?\n- Answer: The therapy sessions were held weekly.

Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct (mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group CBT treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group CBT in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group CBT for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching CBT skills.\n\nRESULTS.\nIntent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=\u22122.21, P=.03). Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=\u22121.65, P=.10). Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=\u2212.29, 95% CI \u22120.38 to \u22120.19, z=\u22125.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions (B=\u2212.20, 95% CI \u22120.32 to \u22120.07, z=\u22123.12, P=.002) experienced significant decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom reduction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool to sustain engagement in CBT for depression over time. There were no differences in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is known to help with depression. But it faces some obstacles when used in low-income communities like people's lack of commitment to regular therapy sessions and homework. However, using automated text messages may help solve these issues, as they can remind patients about their treatment and encourage them to stick with it.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe study tests if a texting service improves people's commitment and results in group therapy sessions for depression. The texts include prompts for mood monitoring and reminders about therapy content. The focus is specifically on whether this service boosts the number of therapy sessions attended, how long patients stay in therapy, and whether it successfully lessens depression symptoms in Spanish-speaking Latino patients with low income.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients were divided into two groups. One received the typical CBT treatment for depression alone (40 participants), while the second group received the same treatment plus the texting service (45 participants). The texting service included daily mood checks, daily reminders about therapy topics, and reminders about medication and therapy sessions. The therapist could access these texts and use them as part of the therapy process.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe study found that those who received texts as part of their treatment stayed in therapy for significantly longer. On average, they remained for 13.5 weeks, compared to just 3 weeks for the standard treatment group. Generally, the texting group also attended more therapy sessions, although this wasn't a significant difference. Both groups showed a substantial reduction in depression symptoms over the course of the treatment. Still, there wasn't a noticeable difference in symptom reduction between the two groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAutomated text messages can be a useful tool to keep patients engaged in their depression treatment. Even though both groups showed a decrease in symptoms, the texting service helped patients to stick with their therapy for longer. The fact that depression levels didn't differ much between the groups might have been influenced by a low number of responses from participants who quit therapy early.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Automated messaging can be used to increase dosage of depression treatment.\n- The text messaging adjunct includes a clinician dashboard to display patient data.\n- The adjunct includes a daily message reiterating the week's theme.\n- Mood data was sent to a Web-based platform called HealthySMS.\n- Qualitative responses were sent to HealthySMS.\n- The data sent to HealthySMS was reviewed by a therapist.\n- The data was displayed in a session.\n- The displayed data was used as a tool for teaching CBT skills.\n- The therapy consisted of 16 sessions.\n- The therapy sessions were held weekly.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
