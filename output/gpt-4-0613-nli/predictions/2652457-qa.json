In this study, a computer assisted learning (CAL) package, containing educationally appropriate knowledge about autism was developed; and the effectiveness of this CAL package was evaluated.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe CAL package was developed using computer software, \"Xerte\" and \"Flash Macromedia\". The effectiveness of the CAL package was evaluated in 32 childcare students in the UK, who were randomised to watch the CAL package or to read the information leaflet containing the same information (n = 16 in each group). Retention performance, level of enjoyment, and level of confidence to identify a child with autism, after the interventions, were evaluated. The data obtained from two studied groups was analysed using unpaired Student's t-test, 95% confidence interval, and effect size.\n\nRESULTS.\nStudents who watched the CAL package had superior retention performance percentage scores (p = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.83\u201312.19, effect size = 0.8) and level of enjoyment (p = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.03\u20132.75, effect size = 0.7) compared with students who read the information leaflet. However, there was no significant difference in level of confidence to identify a child with autism (p = 0.39, 95% CI = -1.80\u20130.72, effect size = -0.3).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CAL package developed was an effective method of educating people who work with children about autism.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis study was performed to show the importance of increasing autism awareness among those who work with children, as it could lead to an earlier diagnosis. For this, the researchers developed a computer program which teaches properly about autism and then checked how well it did the job.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe computer program, a learning tool, was created using two types of computer software. To test its effectiveness, they gave it to 32 childcare students in the UK. Half of these students got to learn with this computer program, while the other half read a leaflet containing the same information. To see how well they learned, the researchers checked how much they remembered, how much they enjoyed the process, and how confident they felt in recognizing a child with autism. Then, they used statistical methods to analyze the data from both groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nStudents who used the computer program remembered more information and enjoyed learning more as compared to students who read the leaflet. However, both groups had the same level of confidence in recognizing a child with autism.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFrom this study, the researchers concluded that the computer program they developed was a useful tool in teaching people who work with children about autism.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The promotion is targeted at populations who work with children.\n- A computer assisted learning (CAL) package was developed in the study.\n- The effectiveness of the CAL package was evaluated in the study.\n- The CAL package was developed.\n- \"Xerte\" is a computer software.\n- \"Flash Macromedia\" is a computer software.\n- \"Xerte\" was used to develop the CAL package.\n- \"Flash Macromedia\" was used to develop the CAL package.\n- The information leaflet contained the same information as the CAL package.\n- The analysis method used was the unpaired Student's t-test.\n- A 95% confidence interval was used in the analysis.\n- The retention performance percentage scores of students who watched the CAL package were superior.\n- The p-value for the retention performance percentage scores was 0.02.\n- The p-value for the level of enjoyment was 0.04.\n- The p-value of the study was 0.39.\n- The education provided by the CAL package is about autism.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\"). For each fact, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text (\"Original\"). Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary.
