One hundred and sixty-five patients with low-energy intertrochanteric fractures, classified as AO/OTA 31A, were prospectively included during a 2-year period (2005\u20132006). Patients were randomized into two groups: group A included 79 hip fractures managed with sliding hip screws and group B included 86 fractures treated with cephalomedullary nails. Delay to surgery, duration of surgery, time of fluoroscopy, total hospital stay, implant-related complications, transfusion requirements, re-operation details, functional recovery, and mortality were recorded. The mean follow-up was 36 months (24\u201356 months). The mean surgical time was statistically significantly shorter and fluoroscopy time longer for the group B. No intraoperative femoral shaft fractures occurred. There was no statistically significant difference in the functional recovery score, reoperation, and mortality rates between the 2 groups. A new type of complication, the so-called Z-effect phenomenon, was noticed in the cephalomedullary nail group. There are no statistically significant differences between the two techniques in terms of type and rate of complications, functional outcome, reoperation and mortality rates when comparing the SHS and the cephalomedullary nail for low-energy AO/OTA 31A intertrochanteric fractures. Our data do not support recommendations for the use of one implant over the other.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study compares two types of implants used to fix broken hips in older people. The research looked at 165 patients who had a specific type of hip fracture, over a two-year period. They were divided into two groups: group A had one type of implant (the sliding hip screw) and group B had a different type (cephalomedullary nails). We compared a number of factors including time until and duration of surgery, how long they stayed in the hospital, any complications related to the implants, whether they needed a blood transfusion, if the surgery had to be repeated, how well they recovered, and if they died during the time of the study. \n\nThe main findings were that surgery was faster but required more x-ray imaging for group B. There were no broken thigh bones during surgery. Both groups had similar scores for recovery, repeat surgery, and death rates. However, we noticed a new complication in the group treated with cephalomedullary nails, named as the Z-effect. \n\nAfter comparing these two types of implants, we didn't see any significant differences between the SHS and the cephalomedullary nail for this specific kind of hip fracture, including outcomes, complications, and death rates. Therefore, we can't recommend one implant over the other based on our study.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study is randomized.\n- The two implants being compared are the extramedullary sliding hip screw (SHS) and the dual lag screw cephalomedullary nail.\n- The implants are used in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures.\n- These patients had low-energy intertrochanteric fractures.\n- The fractures were classified as AO/OTA 31A.\n- The 2-year period was from 2005 to 2006.\n- The inclusion of patients was done prospectively.\n- Group A included 79 hip fractures.\n- Group B included 86 fractures.\n- Time of fluoroscopy was recorded.\n- The follow-up period had a mean duration of 36 months.\n- The shortest follow-up period was 24 months.\n- The longest follow-up period was 56 months.\n- The fluoroscopy time was longer for group B.\n- The complication is called the Z-effect phenomenon.\n- The comparison is for low-energy AO/OTA 31A intertrochanteric fractures.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
