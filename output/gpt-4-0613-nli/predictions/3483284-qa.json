Transient rises in extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have important signaling roles; and acting through purinergic receptors, can increase blood flow and oxygenation of tissues; and act as neurotransmitters. Increased blood flow not only increases substrate availability but may also aid in recovery through removal of metabolic waste products allowing muscles to accomplish more work with less fatigue. The objective of the present study was to determine if supplemental ATP would improve muscle torque, power, work, or fatigue during repeated bouts of high intensity resistance exercise.\n\nMETHODS.\nSixteen participants (8 male and 8 female; ages: 21\u201334 years) were enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study using a crossover design. The participants received either supplemental ATP (400 mg/d divided into 2 daily doses) or placebo for 15 d. After an overnight fast, participants underwent strength and fatigue testing, consisting of 3 sets of 50 maximal knee extensions performed on a Biodex\u00ae leg dynamometer.\n\nRESULTS.\nNo differences were detected in high peak torque, power, or total work with ATP supplementation; however, low peak torque in set 2 was significantly improved (p < 0.01). Additionally, in set 3, a trend was detected for less torque fatigue with ATP supplementation (p < 0.10).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nSupplementation with 400 mg ATP/d for 15 days tended to reduce muscle fatigue and improved a participant\u2019s ability to maintain a higher force output at the end of an exhaustive exercise bout.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThe body has a compound called adenosine-5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP), which is mostly found inside our cells and plays a significant role in energy supply. Brief increases in this compound level outside the cells can be useful as it helps improve blood flow and oxygen supply to tissues. It can also act as a neurotransmitter to help nerves communicate with each other. Better blood flow can assist in our body's recovery after activity by removing waste products from metabolism. It may also empower muscles to do more work without tiring. This study aims to determine if taking extra ATP can enhance muscle power and reduce fatigue during intense workouts.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe included sixteen people (8 men and 8 women; aged between 21-34 years) in a tightly controlled study that neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was getting the ATP supplements or a placebo. The participants were given either ATP supplements (400mg/day divided into two daily doses) or placebo for 15 days. After fasting overnight, the participants were made to do strength and fatigue tests, involving three sets of 50 maximum knee extensions executed on a machine called a Biodex\u00ae leg dynamometer.\n\nRESULTS.\nATP supplementation didn't make any difference in high peak power or total work. But, it did show significant improvement in low peak power in the second set. There was also a notable trend pointing towards less fatigue with ATP supplementation in the third set.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTaking 400 mg of ATP supplements every day for 15 days seemed to decrease muscle fatigue and improved a participant's capacity to maintain a higher force towards the end of an exhaustive exercise.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The release of ATP from cells is tightly controlled.\n- ATP and adenosine act through purinergic receptors.\n- The study uses a crossover design.\n- The improvement in low peak torque in set 2 with ATP supplementation was statistically significant (p < 0.01).\n- The trend was for less torque fatigue.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
