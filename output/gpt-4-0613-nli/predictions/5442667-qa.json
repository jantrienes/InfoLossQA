Doctors might prescribe more drugs than necessary, or drugs that interact negatively with each other.\n\n- Fact: Many drugs with anticholinergic properties are not recognized for this property.\n- Question: Are all drugs with anticholinergic properties recognized as such?\n- Answer: No, many drugs that have anticholinergic properties are not identified as such. This means they might be prescribed without considering their anticholinergic effects.\n\n- Fact: Increased anticholinergic burden can result in significant health risks.\n- Question: What risks are associated with using too much anticholinergic medication?\n- Answer: High levels of anticholinergic drugs can lead to significant health problems. These can range from physical issues, like constipation and blurred vision, to mental problems, like memory loss and confusion.\n\n- Fact: Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions have shown promise.\n- Question: How effective have medication therapy management (MTM) interventions been so far?\n- Answer: MTM interventions, which involve a coordinated effort between healthcare providers to manage a patient's medications, have shown promising results in reducing improper drug use.\n\n- Fact: The study outcomes included changes in the medication appropriateness index (MAI).\n- Question: What was one of the ways the study measured changes in drug use?\n- Answer: The study looked at changes in the medication appropriateness index (MAI). The MAI is a tool that helps evaluate whether a patient's medications are appropriate, effective, and safe.\n\n- Fact: The study outcomes also included changes in the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score.\n- Question: How else did the study monitor changes in drug use?\n- Answer: The study also tracked changes in the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score. This scale measures the burden or load of anticholinergic drugs a patient is taking.\n\n- Fact: The changes in the ADS score were measured from baseline to the end of the study.\n- Question: When were the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores compared?\n- Answer: The ADS scores were compared from the start or baseline of the study to the end of the study.\n  \n- Fact:  The enrollment of participants took place between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015. \n- Question: What was the enrollment period for the study participants?\n- Answer: The study enrolled participants between October 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015.\n\n- Fact: There were 35 women in the group.\n- Question: How many women participated in the study?\n- Answer: There were 35 women who took part in the study.\n\n- Fact: The percentage of women in the group was 70%.\n- Question: What was the percentage of women among the participants of the study?\n- Answer: Women made up 70% of the participants in the study.\n\n- Fact: There were 45 white people in the group.\n- Question: How many participants in the study were white?\n- Answer: Of the people in the study, 45 were white.\n\n- Fact: The percentage of white people in the group was 90%.\n- Question: What was the percentage of white persons among the study participants?\n- Answer: White people made up 90% of the participants in the study.\n\n- Fact: The cognitive status of the cognitively intact individuals was measured using the clinical dementia rating (CDR).\n- Question: How was the cognitive status of the study participants measured?\n- Answer: The study measured the cognitive status of the participants using a tool called the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). This tool assesses memory and cognitive function.\n\n- Fact: The clinical dementia rating (CDR) of the cognitively intact individuals was 0.\n- Question: What was the clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of the cognitively normal individuals?\n- Answer: Cognitively normal individuals, i.e., those without any impairment in thinking or memory, had a clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of 0.\n\n- Fact: The mean age of the group was 77.7 years.\n- Question: What was the average age of the study participants?\n- Answer: The average age of the participants in the study was 77.7 years.\n\n- Fact: The mean MAI at baseline was 12.6.\n- Question: What was the average medication appropriateness index (MAI) score at the start of the study?\n- Answer: At the start of the study, the average MAI score was 12.6.\n\n- Fact: The standard deviation of the MAI at baseline was 6.3.\n- Question: What was the standard deviation of the medication appropriateness index (MAI) scores at the start of the study?\n- Answer: The standard deviation of the MAI scores at the start of the study was 6.3.\n\n- Fact: The mean ADS score was 2.8.\n- Question: What was the average anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score at the start of the study?\n- Answer: At the start of the study, the average ADS score was 2.8.\n\n- Fact: The standard deviation of the ADS score was 1.6.\n- Question: What was the standard deviation of the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores at the start of the study?\n- Answer: The standard deviation of the ADS scores at the start of the study was 1.6.\n\n- Fact: No statistically significant difference was noted between groups after randomization.\n- Question: Was there a significant difference between the two groups after they were divided?\n- Answer: After the participants were divided into two groups, there was no statistically significant difference between these groups. This means that any differences observed could have been due to chance.\n\n- Fact: The intervention group had more participants with intact cognition.\n- Question: What was a notable characteristic of the intervention group?\n- Answer: The group of patients who received the extra support and advice (the intervention group) had more participants with normal, or \"intact\", cognition.\n\n- Fact: CDR was included in all of the analyses.\n- Question: What was included in all the analyses conducted in the study?\n- Answer: The clinically dementia rating (CDR), which is a measure of cognitive function and dementia, was included in all of the study's analyses.\n\n- Fact: The intervention resulted in statistically significant CDR adjusted differences between groups.\n- Question: What was the impact of the intervention on the two groups?\n- Answer: The intervention led to statistically significant differences between the two groups even after adjusting for the clinical dementia rating (CDR). \n\n- Fact: The change score for the MTM group in MAI was 3.6.\n- Question: How much did the medication appropriateness index (MAI) score change for the group that received medication therapy management?\n- Answer: For the group that received medication therapy management, the MAI score improved or decreased by 3.6.\n\n- Fact: The differences were in regard to improved MAI.\n- Question: What aspect did the group with extra support show significant improvement?\n- Answer: The group that received extra support showed significant improvement in their medication appropriateness index (MAI) scores. Lower MAI scores indicate better medication use.\n\n- Fact: The change score for the control group in MAI was 1.0.\n- Question: How much did the medication appropriateness index (MAI) score change for the group that received usual care?\n- Answer: For the group that received usual care, the MAI score improved or decreased by 1.0.\n\n- Fact: The p-value for the difference in MAI scores between the groups was 0.04.\n- Question: What was the significance level of the difference in medication appropriateness index (MAI) scores between the two groups?\n- Answer: The p-value for the difference in MAI scores between the two groups was 0.04. A p-value less than 0.05 means the difference is statistically significant.\n\n- Fact: The differences were also in regard to improved ADS.\n- Question: Other than the medication appropriateness index, where else did the intervention group show improvement?\n- Answer: The group that received the intervention also showed significant improvement in their anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores. Lower ADS scores mean that patients are taking fewer potentially harmful anticholinergic drugs.\n\n- Fact: The change score for the MTM group in ADS was 1.0.\n- Question: How much did anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores change for the group that received medication therapy management?\n- Answer: For the group that received medication therapy management, the ADS score improved or decreased by a mean of 1.0.\n\n- Fact: The change score for the control group in ADS was 0.2.\n- Question: How much did anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores change for the group that received usual care?\n- Answer: For the group that received usual care, the ADS score improved or decreased by an average of 0.2.\n\n- Fact: The results show promise.\n- Question: How promising were the results of using medication therapy management intervention?\n- Answer: The results of the study, which showed improved medication use and lower use of anticholinergic drugs with the help of medication therapy management, were promising.\n\n- Fact: The goal is to ensure optimum outcomes for these medications.\n- Question: What is the ultimate goal when managing medications for older adults?\n- Answer: The ultimate goal is to ensure optimum outcomes: that older adults get the best possible results from their medications, meaning their health improves or remains stable without unnecessary side effects.\n\n- Fact: The registration number of the clinical trial is NCT02172612.\n- Question: Do you know the registration number of the clinical trial?\n- Answer: Yes, the clinical trial was registered under the number NCT02172612.\n\n- Fact: The registration date was 20 June 2014.\n- Question: When was the study registered?\n- Answer: The study was registered on 20 June 2014.\n\n- Fact: The online version of the article has a DOI number: 10.1186/s13195-017-0263-9.\n- Question: Is there a digital identifier for the online version of this study's article?\n- Answer: Yes, the online version of this study's article has the digital object identifier (DOI) number 10.1186/s13195-017-0263-9.\n\n- Fact: The supplementary material is available to authorized users.\n- Question: Who can access the supplementary material of the study?\n- Answer: Only authorized users can access the supplementary material in this study.

Drugs with anticholinergic properties are of particular interest because many are not recognized for this property; their use may lead to increased anticholinergic burden resulting in significant health risks, as well as negatively impacting cognition. Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions showed promise in addressing inappropriate medication use, but the effectiveness of targeted multidisciplinary team interventions addressing anticholinergic medications in older populations is yet to be determined.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted an 8-week, parallel-arm, randomized trial to evaluate whether a targeted patient-centered pharmacist\u2013physician team MTM intervention (\"targeted MTM intervention\") reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients enrolled in a longitudinal cohort at University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Study outcomes included changes in the medication appropriateness index (MAI) targeting anticholinergic medications and in the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score from baseline to the end of study.\n\nRESULTS.\nBetween October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 we enrolled and randomized 50 participants taking at least one medication with anticholinergic properties. Of these, 35 (70%) were women, 45 (90%) were white, and 33 (66%) were cognitively intact (clinical dementia rating [CDR] = 0); mean age was 77.7 \u00b1 6.6 years. At baseline, the mean MAI was 12.6 \u00b1 6.3; 25 (50%) of the participants used two or more anticholinergics, and the mean ADS score was 2.8 \u00b1 1.6. After randomization, although no statistically significant difference was noted between groups, we identified a potentially meaningful imbalance as the intervention group had more participants with intact cognition, and thus included CDR in all of the analyses. The targeted MTM intervention resulted in statistically significant CDR adjusted differences between groups with regard to improved MAI (change score of 3.6 (1.1) for the MTM group as compared with 1.0 (0.9) for the control group, p = 0.04) and ADS (change score of 1.0 (0.3) for the MTM group as compared with 0.2 (0.3) for the control group, p = 0.03).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur targeted MTM intervention resulted in improvement in anticholinergic medication appropriateness and reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients. Our results show promise in an area of great importance to ensure optimum outcomes for medications used in older adults.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02172612.

One group of drugs, known as anticholinergics, can be especially dangerous if overused, as they can have harmful effects on health and brain function. We wanted to see whether a special type of coordinated care between doctors and pharmacists could help reduce the use of these drugs. \n\nMETHODS.\nWe had older patients at the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center, who were taking at least one anticholinergic drug, participate in an 8-week study. We split them into two groups. One group received extra help and advice from a team of a pharmacist and a doctor, while the other group received usual care. We then compared how the groups changed in their use of anticholinergic drugs over the course of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe recruited 50 patients between October 2014 and September 2015. Most were women, white, and with normal brain function. On average, they were around 78 years old. At the start of the study, half of them were taking two or more anticholinergic drugs. After the study,  the group that received extra care saw improved medication appropriateness and reduced their use of anticholinergic drugs. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results suggest that the additional support from a doctor and pharmacist team can help older adults reduce their use of potentially harmful medications. This finding is an important step toward helping older adults take only the medications that benefit them the most. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study has been legally registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. \n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nMore information about this study can be found online if you're authorized to access it.\n\n## Missing facts\n- This complexity often leads to inappropriate prescribing.\n- Inappropriate prescribing is a result of the complexity of medication therapy in older adults with multiple comorbidities.\n- Many drugs with anticholinergic properties are not recognized for this property.\n- Increased anticholinergic burden can result in significant health risks.\n- Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions have shown promise.\n- An 8-week, parallel-arm, randomized trial was conducted.\n- The trial was specifically targeted at older patients.\n- The trial was conducted at the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center.\n- The study outcomes included changes in the medication appropriateness index (MAI).\n- The study outcomes also included changes in the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score.\n- The changes in the ADS score were measured from baseline to the end of the study.\n- The enrollment of participants took place between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015.\n- There were 35 women in the group.\n- The percentage of women in the group was 70%.\n- There were 45 white people in the group.\n- The percentage of white people in the group was 90%.\n- The cognitive status of the cognitively intact individuals was measured using the clinical dementia rating (CDR).\n- The clinical dementia rating (CDR) of the cognitively intact individuals was 0.\n- The mean age of the group was 77.7 years.\n- The mean MAI at baseline was 12.6.\n- The standard deviation of the MAI at baseline was 6.3.\n- The mean ADS score was 2.8.\n- The standard deviation of the ADS score was 1.6.\n- Randomization was used in the study.\n- No statistically significant difference was noted between groups after randomization.\n- The intervention group had more participants with intact cognition.\n- CDR was included in all of the analyses.\n- The intervention resulted in statistically significant CDR adjusted differences between groups.\n- The differences were in regard to improved MAI.\n- The change score for the MTM group in MAI was 3.6 (1.1).\n- The change score for the control group in MAI was 1.0 (0.9).\n- The p-value for the difference in MAI scores between the groups was 0.04.\n- The differences were also in regard to improved ADS.\n- The change score for the MTM group in ADS was 1.0 (0.3).\n- The change score for the control group in ADS was 0.2 (0.3).\n- The results show promise.\n- The goal is to ensure optimum outcomes for these medications.\n- The registration number of the clinical trial is NCT02172612.\n- The registration date was 20 June 2014.\n- The online version of the article has a DOI number: 10.1186/s13195-017-0263-9.\n- The supplementary material is available to authorized users.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
