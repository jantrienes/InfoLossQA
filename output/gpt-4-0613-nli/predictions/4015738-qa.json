Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid\u2013base equilibrium, and the renal function.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from urinary sample.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9. The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid\u2013base equilibrium and higher level of NGAL.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes, acid\u2013base equilibrium, kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT01320891).\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis experiment aims to study the effects of two different types of intravenous fluids used during surgery \u2013 \u2018balanced\u2019 and \u2018unbalanced\u2019. There are concerns that the traditional 'unbalanced' fluid could lead to inflammation, change of blood electrolyte levels, acidity issues, and potentially harm the kidneys. 'Balanced' fluids may reduce these impacts.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe experiment is conducted in a double-blind format, meaning neither the patients nor the doctors knew which fluid was being used. The study included 40 patients undergoing major bowel cancer surgery. They were divided into two groups. One group received 'balanced' fluids, and the other received 'unbalanced' fluids. Measurements of several variables were taken at four different time points during and after surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe group that received 'balanced' fluids had higher levels of certain proteins that are linked to lower inflammation and lower levels of a protein that can indicate tissue damage. The group receiving 'unbalanced' fluids had issues with chloride, calcium, and magnesium levels, more acid-base imbalance, and higher levels of a marker for kidney damage.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing 'balanced' fluids during surgery caused less upset in the body's blood chemicals and acid-base balance and was kinder to kidney function. It might also start an early anti-inflammatory response.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under the reference number NCT01320891.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Administration of normal saline might increase circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n- Administration of normal saline may cause variation of plasmatic electrolytic.\n- Administration of normal saline can lead to hyperchloremic acidosis.\n- The other group is the unbalanced solution (UBS) group.\n- The solutions administered were either colloids or crystalloids.\n- The time of measurement at the end of surgery is referred to as T1.\n- Measurements were performed within 2 hours after surgery.\n- The time of measurement within 2 hours after surgery is referred to as T2.\n- Measurements were performed 24 hours after the beginning of surgery.\n- The time of measurement 24 hours after the beginning of surgery is referred to as T3.\n- Data were collected on active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9).\n- Data were collected on the tissue inhibitor of MMP-9 (TIMP-1).\n- Data were collected on IL-6.\n- Data were collected on IL-8.\n- Data were collected on IL-10.\n- Data were collected on blood gases variables.\n- Data were collected on albumin.\n- Data were collected on total serum protein.\n- The BS group exhibited a higher circulating level of IL-10.\n- The BS group exhibited a higher circulating level of TIMP-1.\n- The BS group exhibited a lower level of active MMP-9.\n- The UBS group experienced hypercloremia.\n- The UBS group experienced hypocalcemia.\n- The UBS group had worse acid-base equilibrium.\n- The UBS group had a higher level of NGAL.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
