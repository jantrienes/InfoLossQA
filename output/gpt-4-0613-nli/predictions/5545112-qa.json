(UC) patients with hypovitaminosis D.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30\u00a0ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups. Matched pair t-tests were computed to assess differences between the vitamin D levels, CRP, UC disease activity and SIBDQ scores before and after vitamin D3 therapy using SPSS version 21.\n\nRESULTS.\nEight UC patients received 2,000 IU/daily and ten UC patients received 4,000 IU/daily of vitamin D3 for 90 days. Vitamin D levels increased after 90 days of oral vitamin D3 in both dose groups. However, the increase in vitamin D levels after 90 days of oral vitamin D3, in the 4,000 IU group was significantly higher 16.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.15 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to the 2,000 IU group of vitamin D 5.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.12 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Normal vitamin D levels (>30 ng/dl) were achieved in four out of the ten UC patients (40%) in the 4,000 IU group and in one out of the eight UC patients (12%) in the 2,000 IU group. In the group receiving 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 the increase in quality life scores (SIBDQ) was significant 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) but not in the 2,000 IU vitamin D3 group 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.87). In the 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 group the mean decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score was \u22120.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.38) compared to \u22121.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19) in the 4,000 IU vitamin D3 group but this was not statistically significant. CRP levels decreased after 90 days of daily vitamin D3 in both the 2,000 IU group and 4,000 IU group by \u22123.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4) and \u221210.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.36) respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nVitamin D3 at 4,000 IU/day is more effective than 2,000 IU/day in increasing vitamin D to sufficient levels in UC patients with hypovitaminosis D, however higher doses or treatment beyond ninety days may be required. Vitamin D3 may improve the quality of life in UC patients but clinically significant improvement is not yet established. The effect of vitamin D3 on UC disease activity is still unclear. Further larger studies are needed to investigate the effects of vitamin D in ulcerative\u00a0colitis.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL:\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D.\n\nMETHODS:\nThe study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used surveys about participant\u2019s quality of life and a score system for disease severity. Lab tests were done and compared between the two groups. Researchers also checked if their vitamin D levels, inflammation, and scores changed before and after taking the vitamin D3.\n\nRESULTS:\nEight patients got 2,000 IU/daily and ten got 4,000 IU/daily of vitamin D3 for three months. Vitamin D levels went up in both groups, but more so in the group taking the higher dose. Healthy vitamin D levels were reached in four out of the ten patients (40%) in the high dose group and one out of eight patients (12%) in the low dose group. The quality of life score also improved significantly in the high dose group, but not in the low dose group. The severity scores of the disease didn\u2019t change significantly in either group. Taking vitamin D3 also seemed to lower inflammation in both groups.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nTaking 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 is more likely to increase vitamin D levels in patients with low levels of vitamin D. However, higher doses or longer time may be needed. Vitamin D3 might improve the quality of life in these patients, but it isn't proven yet. The effect on the severity of the disease is still not clear. More research is needed to better understand the impact of vitamin D in this bowel disease.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The UC patients involved in the evaluation have hypovitaminosis D.\n- The study was double-blinded.\n- The study was conducted at Community Regional Medical Center.\n- The location of the Community Regional Medical Center is Fresno, CA.\n- The serum 25(OH)D level is a criterion for eligibility in the study.\n- UC patients with a serum 25(OH)D level equal to or above 30 ng/ml are not eligible for the study.\n- The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) is used for assessing quality of life.\n- The Partial Mayo Score is used for assessing UC disease activity.\n- Serum lab tests were used in the comparison.\n- The SIBDQ, Partial Mayo Score, and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n- Matched pair t-tests were computed.\n- The variables assessed were vitamin D levels, CRP, UC disease activity, and SIBDQ scores.\n- SPSS version 21 was used for the computation.\n- Vitamin D levels increased after 90 days.\n- The increase in Vitamin D levels was a result of oral vitamin D3.\n- The increase in vitamin D levels in the 4,000 IU group was 16.80 \u00b1 9.15.\n- The increase in vitamin D levels in the 2,000 IU group was 5.00 \u00b1 3.12.\n- The p-value for the increase in the 4,000 IU group was less than 0.001.\n- The p-value for the increase in the 2,000 IU group was 0.008.\n- Normal vitamin D levels are considered to be over 30 ng/dl.\n- There were ten UC patients in the 4,000 IU group.\n- There were eight UC patients in the 2,000 IU group.\n- The increase in quality life scores (SIBDQ) for the 4,000 IU/day group was 1.0 \u00b1 1.0.\n- The increase in quality life scores (SIBDQ) for the 2,000 IU/day group was 0.1 \u00b1 1.0.\n- The p-value for the 4,000 IU/day group was 0.017.\n- The p-value for the 2,000 IU/day group was 0.87.\n- The mean decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score in the 2,000 IU vitamin D3 group was -0.5.\n- The standard deviation of the decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score in the 2,000 IU vitamin D3 group was 1.5.\n- The p-value for the decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score in the 2,000 IU vitamin D3 group was 0.38.\n- The mean decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score in the 4,000 IU vitamin D3 group was -1.3.\n- The standard deviation of the decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score in the 4,000 IU vitamin D3 group was 2.9.\n- The p-value for the decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score in the 4,000 IU vitamin D3 group was 0.19.\n- CRP levels decreased after 90 days of daily vitamin D3.\n- The decrease in CRP levels was observed in both the 2,000 IU group and 4,000 IU group.\n- In the 2,000 IU group, the decrease in CRP levels was \u22123.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4.\n- In the 4,000 IU group, the decrease in CRP levels was \u221210.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.0.\n- The p-value for the decrease in CRP levels in the 2,000 IU group was 0.4.\n- The p-value for the decrease in CRP levels in the 4,000 IU group was 0.36.\n- Vitamin D3 at 4,000 IU/day is more effective than 2,000 IU/day.\n- The effectiveness is measured in terms of increasing vitamin D to sufficient levels.\n- The patients also have hypovitaminosis D.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
