In the present study, we evaluated Se status in UK pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 UK primiparous women to treatment with Se (60 \u03bcg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. UK pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than US women, GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women, and low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3\u00b700, range 0\u00b790\u20135\u00b780 mg/l). Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0\u00b7040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0\u00b7054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0\u00b738, 95 % CI 0\u00b717, 0\u00b787, P= 0\u00b7021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0\u00b730, 95 % CI 0\u00b709, 1\u00b700, P= 0\u00b7049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH. Therefore, UK women of childbearing age need to improve their Se status.\n\n## Simplification\nThis abstract is about a study that explored the connection between a mineral called selenium (Se) and high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy, specifically, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and pre-eclampsia (PE). Mothers-to-be who consume inadequate amounts of selenium may be more likely to develop these conditions.\n\nThe study involved 230 first-time mothers in the UK who were randomly chosen to either receive a selenium supplement or a placebo from the 12th week of pregnancy onwards. Researchers took multiple measurements and assessments related to the women's selenium levels throughout the pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers found that the selenium levels of pregnant women in the UK were lower compared to those of pregnant women in other countries. Factors like age, level of education, and social class positively impacted selenium levels. Women who ate Brazil nuts or consumed more than two seafood servings a week also showed higher selenium levels. \n\nThe research revealed that the lower the selenium level in the toenails (which is an indicator of the body's selenium status), the higher the chances were for a woman to develop PIH or PE. Women who took the selenium supplement were found to be less at risk of developing these conditions.\n\nTo sum up, the study concluded that women in the UK planning to have children should increase their selenium intake, as low levels of this mineral may increase their chances of developing PIH or PE.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study also aimed to establish if Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH.\n- The study was conducted in the present time.\n- The samples came from the SPRINT study.\n- The women in the SPRINT study were randomized to treatment.\n- The dosage of Selenium used in the treatment was 60 \u03bcg/d.\n- Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 weeks.\n- Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 35 weeks.\n- Toenail Se concentration was measured at 16 weeks.\n- Plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration was measured at 35 weeks.\n- Plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity was measured at 12 weeks.\n- Plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity was measured at 20 weeks.\n- Plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity was measured at 35 weeks.\n- The collection of data occurred at baseline.\n- The thing completed by the participants was a FFQ.\n- UK pregnant women had GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women.\n- UK pregnant women had low baseline SEPP1 concentration.\n- The median SEPP1 concentration in UK pregnant women was 3.00 mg/l.\n- The range of SEPP1 concentration in UK pregnant women was 0.90\u20135.80 mg/l.\n- Whole-blood Se concentration was adjusted.\n- The difference in whole-blood Se concentration in women consuming Brazil nuts was statistically significant (P= 0\u00b7040).\n- The difference in whole-blood Se concentration in women consuming more than two seafood portions per week was marginally statistically significant (P= 0\u00b7054).\n- A stepwise logistic regression model was used.\n- Only toenail Se significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH.\n- The odds ratio (OR) for toenail Se was 0.38.\n- The 95% confidence interval (CI) for this OR was between 0.17 and 0.87.\n- The P-value for this effect was 0.021.\n- The P-value was less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance.\n- Se supplementation significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH.\n- The OR for PE/PIH with Se supplementation was 0\u00b730.\n- The 95% confidence interval for the OR was between 0\u00b709 and 1\u00b700.\n- The P-value for the reduction in OR for PE/PIH with Se supplementation was 0\u00b7049.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
