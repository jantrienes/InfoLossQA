However, the stride parameters emerging from such an analysis have never been used to design a training protocol aimed at increasing stride length. With this aim, we investigated the effects of stride frequency manipulation during three weeks of uphill (2%) training on stride length at iso-efficiency speed. Twelve male race walkers were randomly allocated to one of two training groups: stride frequency manipulation (RWM, n=6) and free stride frequency (RWF, n=6). Results. Kinematic parameters measured before and after the 3-week training in RWM showed increased stride length (4.54%; p<0.0001) and contact time (4.58%; p<0.001); inversely, a decreased stride frequency (4.44%; p<0.0001) and internal work (7.09%; p<0.05) were found. In RWF the effect of the training showed a decrease in stride length (1.18%; p<0.0001) and contact time (<1%; p<0.0001) with respect to baseline conditions and an increased stride frequency and internal work of 1.19% (p<0.0001). These results suggest that using slopes (2%) as RWM could help coaches to provide some training methods that would improve an athlete's performance, through increasing stride length without altering his or her race walking technique or metabolic demands.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looked at whether manipulating the speed of steps (stride frequency) during uphill training could increase the distance covered in a single step (stride length) in race walking. The researchers took twelve male race walkers and split them randomly into two groups. One group had structured step frequency during their training, and the other had no specific step frequency set.\n\nThe results showed that the group with structured step frequency saw an increase in the distance of their step and the time their foot was in contact with the ground. Simultaneously, the speed of their steps and energy used decreased. The group without specific step frequency had a decrease in the distance of their step and foot contact time but saw an increase in the speed of their steps and energy used.\n\nThis research suggests that training on slopes with specific step frequencies could offer coaches a useful technique to improve race walkers\u2019 performance by increasing the distance of their steps without changing the walker's style or creating extra energy demand.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Stride length analysis is an easy method.\n- The investigation was conducted during three weeks of training.\n- The uphill gradient was 2%.\n- The stride frequency manipulation group is labeled as RWM.\n- The free stride frequency group is labeled as RWF.\n- There are six race walkers in the stride frequency manipulation group.\n- There are six race walkers in the free stride frequency group.\n- Kinematic parameters were measured before and after the 3-week training in RWM.\n- The stride length increased by 4.54% after the 3-week training in RWM.\n- The increase in stride length was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.0001.\n- The contact time increased by 4.58% after the 3-week training in RWM.\n- The increase in contact time was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001.\n- The stride frequency decreased by 4.44% after the 3-week training in RWM.\n- The decrease in stride frequency was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.0001.\n- The internal work decreased by 7.09% after the 3-week training in RWM.\n- The decrease in internal work was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.05.\n- The decrease in stride length was 1.18%.\n- The decrease in stride length was statistically significant (p<0.0001).\n- In RWF, training resulted in a decrease in contact time.\n- The decrease in contact time was less than 1%.\n- The decrease in contact time was statistically significant (p<0.0001).\n- In RWF, training resulted in an increase in stride frequency.\n- In RWF, training resulted in an increase in internal work.\n- The increase in stride frequency and internal work was 1.19%.\n- The results suggest that using slopes (2%) as RWM could improve an athlete's performance.\n- Coaches could use slopes (2%) as RWM to provide training methods.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
