The primary objective was to confirm that the proportion of patients who experienced one or more major adverse events (MAE) was not higher in the active than in the control group. The study included 379 patients. At least one treatment-related MAE was observed in 9.2% of patients (n = 17) assigned to the active group vs. 13.3% of patients (n = 26) in the control group (P = 0.21), a 4.1% absolute risk reduction (95% CI \u22122.2 to 10.4; P = 0.98). By study design, the mean hospitalization duration was 34% shorter in the active than in the control group (P < 0.001), and HM facilitated the early detection of technical issues and detectable clinical anomalies.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nEarly discharge with HM after PM implantation or replacement was safe and facilitated the monitoring of patients in the month following the procedure.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL\nThe \u0152DIPE study looked at how safe and effective it was to have a shorter stay in the hospital after getting a dual-chamber pacemaker put in or replaced. This was done using a remote heart monitoring program.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients were placed into two groups: (i) the active group, who left the hospital 24 hours after getting a pacemaker for the first time or 4\u20136 hours after a replacement, and were watched for 4 weeks using Home-Monitoring (HM), or (ii) the control group, who were monitored for 4 weeks following standard medical practices. The main goal of the study was to check that the patients who left the hospital early (active group) didn't experience more serious negative events compared to those who stayed longer (control group). \n\nThe study had 379 patients. About 9% of patients in the active group experienced some negative events related to their treatment, compared to about 13% in the control group (the difference was not significant meaning the early discharge was not proven to cause more negative events). Also, those in the active group had a 34% shorter hospital stay compared to the control group, and the Home-Monitoring helped to catch technical and health issues sooner.\n\nCONCLUSION\nLeaving the hospital early with Home-Monitoring after getting a pacemaker put in or replaced was shown to be safe and helpful in keeping an eye on patients' health for a month after the procedure.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Patients were randomly assigned to two groups.\n- The active group was also discharged 4-6 hours after a PM replacement.\n- Major adverse events are referred to as MAE.\n- The percentage of patients in the active group who experienced at least one treatment-related MAE was 9.2%.\n- The control group consists of 26 patients.\n- 13.3% of patients are in the control group.\n- The P-value for the control group is 0.21.\n- The P-value for the absolute risk reduction is 0.98.\n- The difference in hospitalization duration between the active and control group was statistically significant (P < 0.001).\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\"). For each fact, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text (\"Original\"). Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary.
