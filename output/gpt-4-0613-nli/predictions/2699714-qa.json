Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8\u201318.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3\u201318 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C >6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000\u201310,000, platelets >100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n\nRESULTS.\nA1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 \u00b1 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 \u00b1 1.2%; P < 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 \u00b1 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 \u00b1 0.21; P < 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P < 0.05). From baseline to week 24 insulin dose decreased 18% in the etanercept group compared with a 23% increase in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of \u03b2-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.\n\n## Simplification\nGOAL.\nThe goal of this study was to test if a drug called etanercept could help children with newly detected type 1 diabetes continue making their own insulin for longer.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN. \nThis was a six-month experiment carried out at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo's Diabetes Center. A diverse group of 18 kids aged between 7.8-18.2 years participated. They were randomly split into two groups. One group received etanercept, and the other got a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect). The researchers used standard criteria, including age, health status, insulin injections, and general health markers to select the participants. They treated all participants equally whether they finished the study or not.\n\nFINDINGS. \nAt the end of the study, the group that received etanercept had a lower average blood sugar level and seemed to be making more of their own insulin than the placebo group. Their average insulin dose decreased by 18%, while the placebo group's average dose increased by 23%. Importantly, none of the patients dropped out due to side effects from the etanercept.\n\nCONCLUSIONS. \nThis small preliminary study suggests that etanercept might help children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes maintain their ability to produce insulin. Therefore, etanercept might delay the point at which patients need to rely entirely on insulin injections. More extensive research is needed to confirm this possibility and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Etanercept therapy is being considered for use in treatment.\n- The study was double-blind.\n- Eleven of the subjects are male.\n- Seven of the subjects are female.\n- Participants needed to test positive for GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibodies.\n- Participants were required to have three insulin injections per day.\n- The inclusion criteria required a white blood cell count between 3,000 and 10,000.\n- Participants needed to have a platelet count greater than 100,000.\n- Participants were required to have normal liver function.\n- Participants were required to have normal renal function.\n- The difference in A1C levels between the etanercept group and the placebo group at week 24 was statistically significant (P < 0.05).\n- The placebo had a value of 0.18.\n- The results of the study were statistically significant (since p < 0.01).\n- The placebo group showed a 20% decrease in the C-peptide area under the curve.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
