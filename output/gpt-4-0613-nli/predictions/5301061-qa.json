This means they did not participate in the religious program and their results were used for comparison.\n\n- Fact: The SWB questionnaire was completed in two groups.\n- Question: How many groups completed the SWB (Spiritual Wellbeing) questionnaire in the study?\n- Answer: The SWB questionnaire was completed by two groups in this study - the experimental group that attended the religious program and the control group that did not.\n\n- Fact: The Chi-square test was used in the study for data analysis.\n- Question: What statistical method was used to analyze the data in the study?\n- Answer: Several statistical methods were used to analyze the data in the study, including the Chi-square test, which helps to determine if there is a significant relationship between two variables.\n\n- Fact: The independent t-test was used in the study for data analysis.\n- Question: What other statistical analyses were used in the study?\n- Answer: Along with the Chi-square test, the independent t-test was also used in the study.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of religious programs based on Islam on spiritual wellbeing in elderly patients with hypertension who referred to the health centers of Isfahan in 2014.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThis study was a randomized clinical trial. The participants (52 elderly patients with hypertension) were randomly divided in to experimental and control groups. Religious program was implemented for the experimental group in eight sessions in two Isfahan health centers. Spirituality wellbeing survey (SWB) questionnaire was completed in three steps, namely, pretest, posttest and follow-up (1 month) in two groups. In the study, Chi-square test, independent t-test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance were performed for analyzing the data.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the intervention, there was no significant difference between the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing of the two groups. However in the posttest step and follow-up stage, the mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe religious program based on Islam promoted the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension; further, nurses can use these programs to promote the SWB of elderly patients with hypertension.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nMany older people with high blood pressure suffer from poor spiritual health which can negatively affect them mentally, socially, and physically. Given this, it's important to explore ways of boosting their spiritual wellness. In this study, we examined the effects of religious programs based on Islam on improving spiritual health among elderly people with high blood pressure attending health clinics in Isfahan in 2014.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe carried out our experiment by selecting 52 older people with high blood pressure and splitting them randomly into two groups. One group attended an Islamic-based religious program for eight sessions in two health centers in Isfahan. A questionnaire designed to measure spiritual wellbeing was completed by both groups during three stages; before the program (pre-test), at the end of the program (post-test), and a month after the program (follow-up). We used statistical tests to analyze the data we collected.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the religious program, there was no significant difference between the spiritual wellbeing scores of the two groups. However, after the program and a month later, the group that attended the program had significantly higher spiritual wellbeing scores than the group that did not attend the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings suggest that an Islamic-based religious program can enhance the spiritual wellbeing of elderly people with high blood pressure. Therefore, health professionals like nurses can use such programs to improve their patients' spiritual health.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Lack of spiritual health in patients with hypertension leads to many physical effects.\n- Hypertension is prevalent among the elderly.\n- Interventions to enhance the spiritual wellbeing of the elderly with hypertension are essential.\n- All the participants are elderly.\n- All the participants have hypertension.\n- The other group is a control group.\n- The SWB questionnaire was completed in two groups.\n- The Chi-square test was used in the study for data analysis.\n- The independent t-test was used in the study for data analysis.\n- The repeated-measures analysis of variance was used in the study for data analysis.\n- There was no significant difference in the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing between the two groups before the intervention.\n- The differences in mean scores of spiritual wellbeing, the religious dimension, and the existential aspect of spiritual wellbeing between the experimental and control groups were statistically significant (P < 0.001).\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
