That means neither the patients nor the researchers knew who was getting what treatment, to avoid bias.\n\n- Fact: The study is an open label study.\n- Question: Was the study design open label? \n- Answer: Yes, while the study was double-blinded it was also an open label study, meaning that the researchers and the participants knew what medication was given but the two groups were not aware of the different treatments between groups.\n\n- Fact: The patients were of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II.\n- Question: What was the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status of the patients in the study?\n- Answer: The patients were of ASA status I and II. The ASA status is a system for assessing the fitness of patients before surgery; ASA I patients are healthy either during non-surgical treatment or before surgery, and ASA II patients have mild systemic disease. \n\n- Fact: The patients were scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery.\n- Question: What type of surgery were the patients in the study scheduled for?\n- Answer: All the patients in the study were scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery, which is planned non-emergency surgery for conditions below the belly button.\n\n- Fact: Patients in group \"B\" received 0.4 mL of normal saline.\n- Question: What was given to patients in the first group along with the normal anesthetic?\n- Answer: In the first group, known as \"group B,\" patients were given 0.4 mL of normal saline along with the anesthetic.\n\n- Fact: The treatment for group \"B\" was administered in the subarachnoid block.\n- Question: Where was the treatment for the first group administered?\n- Answer: For the patients in group \"B,\" the treatment of anesthetic and normal saline was administered in the subarachnoid block, which is a space in the spine where spinal anesthesia is often injected.\n\n- Fact: Patients in group \"BM\" received 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine.\n- Question: What was the anesthetic used for the second group of patients?\n- Answer: The anesthetic used for the second group of patients, called \"group BM,\" was 12.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine.\n\n- Fact: Patients in group \"BM\" received preservative free midazolam 0.4 mL.\n- Question: In addition to the anesthetic, what else was given to the patients in the second group?\n- Answer: The second group was not only given an anesthetic, but they were also given 0.4 mL of midazolam, a sedative drug that was free of preservatives.\n\n- Fact: The amount of midazolam administered to group \"BM\" patients was 2 mg.\n- Question: What was the exact dosage of midazolam given to patients in the second group?\n- Answer: The patients in the second group, group \"BM,\" were given 2 mg of midazolam.\n\n- Fact: The median duration of analgesia without midazolam is 220 minutes.\n- Question: How long does the pain relief typically last when only the regular anesthetic is used? \n- Answer: The median duration of pain relief, or analgesia, is typically 220 minutes when only the normal anesthetic is used. \n\n- Fact: The use of midazolam significantly increases the duration of motor block.\n- Question: How does the use of midazolam affect numbness in the patient?\n- Answer: The use of midazolam significantly increases the duration of motor block, meaning it keeps the patient numb for a longer period of time.\n\n- Fact: The median duration of motor block without midazolam is 195 minutes.\n- Question: How long does the numbness last when only the regular anesthesia is used?\n- Answer: The median length of time a patient remains numb, or the duration of motor block, is around 195 minutes when only the regular anesthetic is used."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 927, "completion_tokens": 1046, "total_tokens": 1973}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nSpinal anaesthesia, which is one of the techniques for infraumbilical surgeries, is most commonly criticized for limited duration of postoperative analgesia. Several adjuvants have been tried along with local anesthetic for prolonging the duration of analgesia. In this study, we have observed the effect of midazolam as an adjuvant in patients undergoing infraumbilical surgery. In this prospective, randomized, double blinded, and parallel group and open label study of 90 adult patients aged 18\u201360 years, of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II, scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery, were randomly allocated in two groups. Each patient in group \"B\" received hyperbaric bupivacaine 12.5 mg along with 0.4 mL of normal saline in the subarachnoid block, and patients of group \"BM\" received 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine along with preservative free midazolam 0.4 mL (2 mg). We found that use of midazolam as adjuvant with the local anesthetic in spinal anaesthesia significantly increases the duration of analgesia (median 320 min versus 220 min) and motor block (median 255 min versus 195 min) but decreases the incidence of postoperative nausea-vomiting (PONV).\n\n## Simplification\nSpinal anesthesia is often used during surgeries below the belly button, like a C-section or a hernia operation. But one of the pain-relief medicine's biggest drawbacks is that it doesn't work for long after surgery. Several other medicines have been tried with the aim of making it last longer. In this study, we wanted to see what effect the drug midazolam would have if used along with the anesthetic in these lower body surgeries.\n\nThe study involved 90 adult patients, aged 18 to 60, who were already scheduled for such a surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group was given the normal anesthetic along with a saline solution. The second group received the same anesthetic, but with midazolam added.\n\nOur findings showed that adding midazolam to the anesthetic used in spinal anesthesia made the pain relief last longer (on average, 320 minutes compared to 220 minutes) and also made the numbness last longer (averaging 255 minutes versus 195 minutes). It also reduced the occurrence of nausea and vomiting after surgery.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Spinal anaesthesia is commonly criticized.\n- These adjuvants are used along with local anesthetic.\n- The study is prospective.\n- The study is double blinded.\n- The study is an open label study.\n- The patients were of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II.\n- The patients were scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery.\n- Patients in group \"B\" received 0.4 mL of normal saline.\n- The treatment for group \"B\" was administered in the subarachnoid block.\n- Patients in group \"BM\" received 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine.\n- Patients in group \"BM\" received preservative free midazolam 0.4 mL.\n- The amount of midazolam administered to group \"BM\" patients was 2 mg.\n- The median duration of analgesia without midazolam is 220 minutes.\n- The use of midazolam significantly increases the duration of motor block.\n- The median duration of motor block without midazolam is 195 minutes.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
