The most effective diabetes prevention method in prediabetic adults is lifestyle modification. However, despite the benefits of lifestyle change, diabetes prevalence continues to increase. Maintaining a regular exercise routine and a healthy eating plan may be difficult because of the negative emotional barriers (i.e., stress, mood) that a prediabetic individual faces. This is particularly evident in older individuals when you combine that with decreases in mobility and geriatric syndromes. A potential treatment for these emotional barriers is a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). In the current study, the group included 154 participants, both men and women, ranging between the ages of 41 to 71 years old. The study design was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group study. The Psychosocial Depressive Symptoms Questionnaire (PDS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to examine the effect of two doses of 5-ALA (15 mg and 50 mg) on various components of mood (i.e., hopefulness, loneliness, and motivation) and coping ability. Using SAS software, an ordered logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between the dose groups (control, 15 mg, and 50 mg) and the responses to the two questionnaires, the PDS and PSS, used in this study. An integrative literature review, using the PubMed database, searched for studies on the relationship between 5-ALA administration and mood and coping ability. Our literature review resulted in zero published articles. Next, we found that the intake of 5-ALA was significantly associated with improved coping ability (p = 0.004) and improved self-perception of effort spent (p = 0.002). Finally, we found a significant dose-dependent relationship for the association of 5-ALA intake on measures of effort (p = 0.003), loneliness (p = 0.006), and coping ability (p = 0.003). The 50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose in improving these measures. In conclusion, after 12 weeks of taking 5-ALA, we found significant improvements in self-perception of effort spent, loneliness, and coping ability in prediabetic middle age and older adults. Improved mood and coping ability may allow prediabetic individuals to overcome the emotional obstacles preventing them from maintaining a healthy lifestyle and ultimately, help them to avoid the development of diabetes.\n\n## Simplification\nIn 2010, around 79 million Americans, over half of whom were over 65, had a condition called prediabetes. The best way to prevent this condition turning into full diabetes is through lifestyle changes, like maintaining a regular exercise routine and eating healthy foods. However, these changes can be tough due to emotional struggles such as stress and low mood, particularly in older people who also face mobility issues.\n\nOur study investigated if a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) could help. We ran a trial with 154 people, both men and women aged between 41 and 71, who were randomly selected to receive either no supplement, a 15 mg dose, or a 50 mg dose. We also checked their mood and stress levels. We found no previous research on this topic.\n\nThe results showed that taking 5-ALA helped improve people's ability to cope and how they felt about the effort they were making, and it reduced feelings of loneliness. The 50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose. After 12 weeks of taking the supplement, people's mood and coping abilities were much better. \n\nThis could be a breakthrough for prediabetic individuals, as it could help them overcome the emotional struggles that often get in the way of them adopting healthier habits, ultimately assisting them in preventing full diabetes.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Lifestyle modification is the most effective method of diabetes prevention in prediabetic adults.\n- Diabetes prevalence is increasing.\n- The increase in diabetes prevalence is happening despite the benefits of lifestyle change.\n- The study was designed as a double-blind study.\n- The study was designed as a parallel-group study.\n- The Psychosocial Depressive Symptoms Questionnaire (PDS) was used in the study.\n- The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used in the study.\n- The components of mood examined were hopefulness, loneliness, and motivation.\n- SAS software was used in the analysis.\n- An ordered logistic regression model was used in the analysis.\n- The analysis was to determine the association between dose groups and responses to two questionnaires.\n- The responses to two questionnaires were analyzed.\n- The two questionnaires used in the study are the PDS and PSS.\n- An integrative literature review was conducted.\n- The literature review used the PubMed database.\n- The p-value for the association between 5-ALA intake and improved coping ability is 0.004.\n- The intake of 5-ALA was also found to be significantly associated with improved self-perception of effort spent.\n- The p-value for the association between 5-ALA intake and improved self-perception of effort spent is 0.002.\n- A significant dose-dependent relationship was found for the association of 5-ALA intake.\n- The p-value for the association of 5-ALA intake on effort was 0.003.\n- The p-value for the association of 5-ALA intake on loneliness was 0.006.\n- The p-value for the association of 5-ALA intake on coping ability was 0.003.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
