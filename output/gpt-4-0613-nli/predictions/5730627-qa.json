This means they assessed the ADHD symptoms at multiple time points and used this data to analyze the effectiveness of the drugs.\n\n- Fact: One of the secondary endpoints was improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Improvement scale (CGI-I).\n- Question: Besides changes in ADHD symptoms, what other measure was used to evaluate improvement?\n- Answer: The researchers also looked at improvement according to the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I), which provides a clinician's rating of how much a patient's illness has improved or worsened.\n\n- Fact: The LS mean ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment with placebo was -17.0 \u00b1 1.03 in the forced-dose study.\n- Question: How much did the ADHD symptoms change in the placebo group of the forced-dose study?\n- Answer: Using a measure called the least squares (LS) mean, which is a type of adjusted average, the researchers found that ADHD symptoms improved by -17.0 points (plus or minus 1.03 points) in the placebo group of the forced-dose study. A negative number here indicates improvement because it represents a reduction in symptom score.\n\n- Fact: The LS mean ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment with LDX was -25.4 \u00b1 0.74 in the forced-dose study.\n- Question: How much did the ADHD symptoms change in the LDX group of the forced-dose study?\n- Answer: In the forced-dose study, the LS mean ADHD symptoms score improved by -25.4 points (plus or minus 0.74 points) in the group treated with LDX. A negative number here indicates improvement as it represents a reduction in symptom score. \n\n- Fact: The LS mean ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment with OROS-MPH was -22.1 \u00b1 0.73 in the forced-dose study.\n- Question: What was the change in ADHD symptoms in the OROS-MPH group in the forced-dose study?\n- Answer: In the forced-dose study, the ADHD symptoms in the group treated with OROS-MPH improved by an LS mean of -22.1 points (plus or minus 0.73 points). Again, a negative number here shows improvement because it reflects a reduction in symptom score.\n\n- Fact: The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX in the forced-dose study was 66.5%.\n- Question: How often did treatment-emergent adverse events (side effects that appeared after treatment) occur with LDX in the forced-dose study?\n- Answer: In the forced-dose study, treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 66.5% of the adolescents treated with LDX. \n\n- Fact: The overall frequency of TEAEs for OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study was 58.9%.\n- Question: How often did side effects occur with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study?\n- Answer: Treatment-emergent adverse events were seen in 58.9% of the adolescents treated with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study.\n\n- Fact: LDX was superior to OROS-MPH in a forced-dose study involving adolescents with ADHD.\n- Question: Which medication worked better in the forced-dose study, LDX or OROS-MPH?\n- Answer: In the forced-dose study, LDX was found to be more effective than OROS-MPH in treating ADHD symptoms in adolescents.\n\n- Fact: The findings underscore the efficacy of psychostimulant classes.\n- Question: What do these findings say about the effectiveness of psychostimulants (the class of drugs to which LDX and OROS-MPH belong) for treating ADHD?\n- Answer: These findings highlight that psychostimulants, such as LDX and OROS-MPH, are effective for treating ADHD symptoms in adolescents."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3213, "completion_tokens": 1611, "total_tokens": 4824}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND.\nPsychostimulants are considered first-line pharmacotherapy for youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but questions remain regarding the comparative efficacy of amphetamine- and methylphenidate-based agents.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nOur objective was to describe two acute randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, head-to-head studies of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) in adolescents with ADHD.\n\nMETHODS.\nAdolescents (13\u201317 years) diagnosed with ADHD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria were enrolled in an 8-week flexible-dose study [LDX 30\u201370 mg/day (n = 186 randomized); OROS-MPH 18\u201372 mg/day (n = 185 randomized); placebo (n = 93 randomized)] or a 6-week forced-dose study [LDX 70 mg/day (n = 219 randomized); OROS-MPH 72 mg/day (n = 220 randomized); placebo (n = 110 randomized)]. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score changes from baseline (primary endpoint) at week 8 (flexible-dose study) or week 6 (forced-dose study) were assessed with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Improvement scale (CGI-I; key secondary endpoint) and changes from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV subscales. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.\n\nRESULTS.\nLeast squares (LS) mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment were \u221217.0 \u00b1 1.03 with placebo, \u221225.4 \u00b1 0.74 with LDX, and \u221222.1 \u00b1 0.73 with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study and \u221213.4 \u00b1 1.19 with placebo, \u221225.6 \u00b1 0.82 with LDX, and \u221223.5 \u00b1 0.80 with OROS-MPH in the flexible-dose study. LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment difference for the change from baseline significantly favored LDX over OROS-MPH in the forced-dose [\u22123.4 \u00b1 1.04, p = 0.0013, effect size (ES) \u22120.33] but not the flexible-dose (\u22122.1 \u00b1 1.15, p = 0.0717, ES \u22120.20) study. The percentage of improved participants on the dichotomized CGI-I at end of treatment was significantly greater with LDX than with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study (81.4 vs. 71.3%, p = 0.0188) but not the flexible-dose study (LDX 83.1%, OROS-MPH 81.0%, p = 0.6165). The LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment differences for change from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales nominally favored LDX in the forced-dose study (hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.49, nominal p = 0.0081, ES \u22120.27; inattentiveness subscale \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.63, nominal p = 0.0013, ES \u22120.33), but there were no significant differences between active treatments in the flexible-dose study. In both studies, LDX and OROS-MPH were superior to placebo for all efficacy-related endpoints (all nominal p < 0.0001; ES range \u22120.43 to \u22121.16). The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX and OROS-MPH, respectively, were 66.5 and 58.9% in the forced-dose study and 83.2 and 82.1% in the flexible-dose study. TEAEs occurring in \u2265 5% of participants that were also reported at two or more times the rate of placebo were decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, initial insomnia, dry mouth, and nasopharyngitis (LDX and OROS-MPH), irritability and dizziness (LDX only), and increased heart rate (OROS-MPH only) in the forced-dose study and decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, and dizziness (LDX and OROS-MPH) and dry mouth and upper abdominal pain (LDX only) in the flexible-dose study. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) increases from baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) were observed in the forced-dose study [LDX 1.6 \u00b1 9.65 and 3.3 \u00b1 8.11 mmHg, 6.7 \u00b1 12.78 beats per minute (bpm); OROS-MPH 2.6 \u00b1 10.15 and 3.3 \u00b1 9.13 mmHg, 7.6 \u00b1 12.47 bpm] and the flexible-dose study (LDX 2.4 \u00b1 9.46 and 2.8 \u00b1 8.41 mmHg, 4.7 \u00b1 11.82 bpm; OROS-MPH 0.4 \u00b1 9.90 and 2.2 \u00b1 8.64 mmHg, 6.0 \u00b1 10.52 bpm) at the last on-treatment assessment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLDX was superior to OROS-MPH in adolescents with ADHD in the forced-dose but not the flexible-dose study. Safety and tolerability for both medications was consistent with previous studies. These findings underscore the robust acute efficacy of both psychostimulant classes in treating adolescents with ADHD.\n\nCLINICALTRIALS.GOV REGISTRY NUMBERS.\nNCT01552915 and NCT01552902.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40263-017-0468-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nThis research looks at the effectiveness of certain drugs that are typically used for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in young people. The study particularly compares two drugs: lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH).\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nWe studied and compared the effects of LDX and OROS-MPH on ADHD symptoms in teenagers.\n\nMETHODS.\nTeenagers diagnosed with ADHD participated in two separate studies. In one 8-week study, the dose was flexible and in another 6-week study, the dose was fixed. We measured the changes in their ADHD symptoms at the end of each study. We also tracked any side effects as well as their vital signs.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe results showed that both LDX and OROS-MPH improved ADHD symptoms more than a placebo (a dummy pill). But, LDX had a slightly better result in the fixed-dose study, whereas in the flexible-dose study, there wasn't much difference between LDX and OROS-MPH. We also found common side effects, including loss of appetite, weight loss, sleep problems, dry mouth, and minor infections. The drugs also slightly increased blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings show that LDX was more effective than OROS-MPH in the fixed-dose study, but not in the flexible-dose study. Both drugs were safe and similar findings have been reported in previous studies. Both types of drugs were effective in treating ADHD symptoms in teenagers.\n\nACCESS TO MORE MATERIAL.\nYou can find additional material related to this article online if you're authorized.
