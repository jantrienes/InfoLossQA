The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nPatients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (\u00b1standard deviation) was 71.2 (\u00b110.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155). The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) number of follow-up visits during the 1-year study period was 1.3 (\u00b11.3) for G1, 1.6 (\u00b11.3) for G2, and 1.3 (\u00b11.1) for G3 (P=0.48). Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of \u22651 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28). Sub-analysis of adherence rates for patients who attended \u22652 follow-up visits were 91.3% (n=21/23) for G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) for G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) for G3, (P=0.11).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nHelp from a patient navigator did not increase the likelihood of keeping \u22651 follow-up appointment in an office-based setting. Adherence rates for follow-up appointments reached close to 70% or above in a self-selected patient population.\n\n## Simplification\nPURPOSE.\nThis study looked at how having a 'patient navigator' - a person who helps guide a patient through their healthcare journey - could change how regularly patients with glaucoma go to their follow-up eye check-ups. This is important because missed appointments can lead to worse vision problems. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS. \nThe study used people who were diagnosed with some form of glaucoma after taking an eye test in Philadelphia, USA. These people were put into three groups for one year: one group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator, the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator, and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator. Then, they compared how well each group stuck to their appointment schedule. \n\nRESULTS.\n155 patients were included in this study. They were generally around 71 years old, mostly women, and primarily African-American. The number of follow-up visits during the year was about the same between the three groups. Around 70% to 82% of patients in all groups attended at least one follow-up visit. When looking at only the people who attended two or more follow-up visits, the group with a patient navigator within the community had the highest turn out. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nEven though having a patient navigator didn't make people more likely to go to an office for their check-ups, people did have a decent rate of attendance at their follow-up visits on their own. It is unclear if the community-based care with a navigator helped with the higher rate of attendance for two or more check-ups, which suggests more study is needed.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The patients were diagnosed following a comprehensive eye examination.\n- The trial took place in Philadelphia, PA, USA.\n- The patients were enrolled from 43 community sites.\n- The community sites are located in Philadelphia, PA, USA.\n- Group 3's care was considered the usual care.\n- A chi-squared test was used for the comparison.\n- The significance level used in the test was 0.05.\n- All the enrolled patients had glaucoma-related diagnoses.\n- The mean age is 71.2 years.\n- The percentage of female patients was 65.8%.\n- The number of female patients was 102 out of 155.\n- The percentage of African-American patients was 71.6%.\n- The number of African-American patients was 111 out of 155.\n- The mean number of follow-up visits for G1 was 1.3.\n- The standard deviation of the number of follow-up visits for G1 was 1.3.\n- The mean number of follow-up visits for G2 was 1.6.\n- The standard deviation of the number of follow-up visits for G2 was 1.3.\n- The mean number of follow-up visits for G3 was 1.3.\n- The standard deviation of the number of follow-up visits for G3 was 1.1.\n- The P-value for the comparison of the number of follow-up visits among G1, G2, and G3 was 0.48.\n- The appointment adherence for G1 was 69.8%.\n- The number of G1 participants who adhered to the appointment was 37.\n- The total number of G1 participants was 53.\n- The appointment adherence for G2 was 82.5%.\n- The number of G2 participants who adhered to the appointment was 47.\n- The total number of G2 participants was 57.\n- The appointment adherence for G3 was 73.3%.\n- The number of G3 participants who adhered to the appointment was 33.\n- The adherence rate for patients in G1 who attended at least 2 follow-up visits was 91.3%.\n- The number of patients in G1 who attended at least 2 follow-up visits was 23, out of which 21 adhered.\n- The adherence rate for patients in G2 who attended at least 2 follow-up visits was 74.3%.\n- The number of patients in G2 who attended at least 2 follow-up visits was 35, out of which 26 adhered.\n- The adherence rate for patients in G3 who attended at least 2 follow-up visits was 66.7%.\n- The number of patients in G3 who attended at least 2 follow-up visits was 27, out of which 18 adhered.\n- The P-value for the comparison of adherence rates among the three groups is 0.11.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
