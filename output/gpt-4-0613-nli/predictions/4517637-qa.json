The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children <24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (\u22120.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (\u22120.20 to 0.63) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIt is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDutch Trial Register NTR2334.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nBabies who have heart surgery may not get enough protein. This is because having surgery and using a heart-lung machine during the operation might break down protein faster than normal, and these babies might not eat enough to replace it. This study was done to see how giving these babies more protein after surgery would affect their protein levels.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a study where we randomly chose some babies to get a lot of protein and some to get a normal amount. This was done on the second day after they had surgery to fix heart defects they were born with. We did a special test to measure how much of a kind of protein called \"valine\" their bodies were making. We also measured how much of another protein called \"albumin\" their bodies were making. We then compared the results between the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\n28 babies, who were around 9 months old and weighed about 7 kg, took part in the study. However, we could only use the data from 20 of them for our final results. Because we didn't have enough data, we couldn't make conclusions about protein levels. There was no difference in albumin production between the two groups. However, we saw that the babies getting a lot of protein had higher levels of valine and another substance called BUN, which is an indicator of how much protein a person is getting.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIt looks like the extra protein in the diet of the high-protein group might have increased the levels of valine and BUN. However, because we didn't have enough data, we can't say for sure that a high-protein diet would change protein levels in these babies. Therefore, the results from our study should be taken as a starting point for further research.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered with the Dutch Trial Register (NTR2334).\n\n## Missing facts\n- Negative protein balance in infants can be due to increased proteolysis.\n- Negative protein balance in infants can also be due to limited intake.\n- The study is focused on protein kinetics.\n- The high-protein diet is short-term.\n- The high-protein diet is being used post cardiac surgery in infants.\n- The trial was prospective.\n- The trial was double-blinded.\n- The trial compared the effects of a high protein diet to a normal protein diet.\n- The high protein diet consisted of 5 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121.\n- The normal protein diet consisted of 2 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121.\n- The diets were administered enterally.\n- The trial focused on protein kinetics.\n- Fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) was measured.\n- The measurements were done using mass spectrometry.\n- [1-13C]valine infusion was used in the process.\n- The process involves the use of infusion.\n- The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used.\n- The purpose of using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test was to investigate differences.\n- The Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used.\n- The procedure was used to create a confidence interval.\n- The confidence interval was created with a point estimate.\n- The point estimate was of median differences.\n- The median differences were between groups.\n- The median age of the children in the study was 9 months.\n- The median weight of the children in the study was 7 kg.\n- The study was underpowered.\n- The underpowering of the study prevented conclusions from being drawn.\n- The valine synthesis rate in the HP diet was 2.73 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The range of valine synthesis rate in the HP diet was from 0.94 to 3.36 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The valine synthesis rate in the NP diet was 2.26 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The range of valine synthesis rate in the NP diet was from 1.85 to 2.73 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The net valine balance in the HP group was 0.54 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The lowest possible net valine balance in the HP group was -0.73 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The highest possible net valine balance in the HP group was 1.75 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The net valine balance in the NP group was 0.24 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The lowest possible net valine balance in the NP group was -0.20 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- The highest possible net valine balance in the NP group was 0.63 \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121.\n- There is no difference in FSRalb between the groups.\n- The HP diet led to increased oxidation.\n- The HP diet led to increased BUN.\n- The NP diet resulted in less oxidation compared to the HP diet.\n- The NP diet resulted in less BUN compared to the HP diet.\n- The metabolic fate of surplus protein is possibly explained by increased oxidation and BUN.\n- The observation was made comparing the HP diet and the NP diet.\n- There is a surplus protein in the HP group.\n- The HP group has an increase in valine oxidation.\n- The HP group has an increase in ureagenesis.\n- The increase in valine oxidation and ureagenesis in the HP group is potentially caused by the surplus protein.\n- The HP group is being compared to the NP group.\n- A study was conducted on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance.\n- Too few patients had completed the study.\n- The reason for the inability to draw conclusions was the insufficient number of patients who completed the study.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
