This means that neither the doctors nor the patients knew whether they were in the ketamine group or the control group.\n\n- Fact: The operation was for acute appendicitis.\n- Question: What was the type of operation conducted in this study?\n- Answer: The operation conducted in this study was for acute appendicitis, a condition which causes sudden, severe pain in the lower right abdomen and requires immediate surgery.\n\n- Fact: The dosage of ketamine given to the patients was 0.5 mg/kg.\n- Question: What dosage of ketamine was administered to the patients?\n- Answer: The dosage of the ketamine given to the patients was 0.5 mg for every kilogram of the patient's weight.\n\n- Fact: The ketamine was given 10 minutes before the surgical incision.\n- Question: When was the ketamine administered to the patients?\n- Answer: The ketamine was given to the patients 10 minutes before the surgical incision was made.\n\n- Fact: The patients were in the operating room when they received the ketamine.\n- Question: Where were the patients when they received the ketamine?\n- Answer: The patients were in the operating room when they received the ketamine.\n\n- Fact: The substance injected was normal saline.\n- Question: What was the substance injected into the control group?\n- Answer: The substance that was injected into the control group was normal saline, which is basically sterile salt water.\n\n- Fact: The dosage of normal saline injected was 0.5 mg/kg.\n- Question: What dosage of normal saline was injected into the control group?\n- Answer: The dosage of normal saline injected was 0.5 mg per kg of the patient's weight.\n\n- Fact: The 10 points visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for the assessment.\n- Question: What scale was used to measure the patients' pain levels?\n- Answer: A scale called the 10 point visual analogue scale (VAS) was used. This is a simple tool that asks the patients to rate their pain intensity from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).\n\n- Fact: The difference in VAS scores between the ketamine group and the control group was significant.\n- Question: How did the levels of pain, as measured on the VAS, compare between the ketamine group and the control group?\n- Answer: The difference in the VAS scores between the ketamine group and the control group was significant. This means that overall, the patients who received ketamine experienced less pain.\n\n- Fact: The interval time for the first analgesic request was 23.1 \u00b1 6.7 minutes for the case group.\n- Question: How long did it take for the ketamine group to first request additional pain relief?\n- Answer: On average, it took the ketamine group about 23.1 minutes to first request additional pain relief.\n\n- Fact: The interval time for the first analgesic request for the control group was 18.1 \u00b1 7.3 minutes.\n- Question: How long did it take for the control group to first request additional pain relief?\n- Answer: On average, it took the control group about 18.1 minutes to first request additional pain relief.\n\n- Fact: The total number of pethidine injections in the first 24 hours postoperatively was 0.6 \u00b1 0.6 for the case group.\n- Question: How many strong pain relief injections were needed by the ketamine group in the 24 hours after surgery?\n- Answer: The ketamine group needed, on average, 0.6 strong pain relief injections (specifically, pethidine) in the first 24 hours after surgery.\n\n- Fact: The control group received an average of 2.0 \u00b1 0.8 pethidine injections in the first 24 hours postoperatively.\n- Question: How many strong pain relief injections were needed by the control group in the 24 hours after surgery?\n- Answer: The control group needed, on average, 2.0 strong pain relief injections (specifically, pethidine) in the first 24 hours after surgery.\n\n- Fact: The drug has the potential to cause side effects.\n- Question: Can ketamine cause any side effects in patients?\n- Answer: Yes, although none were experienced in this study, ketamine has the potential to cause side effects in patients. However, these side effects may depend on a number of factors, including the individual patient's health and their reaction to the drug."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1237, "completion_tokens": 960, "total_tokens": 2197}, "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 4096, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND.\nAlthough early reviews of clinical findings were mostly negative, there is still a widespread belief for the efficacy of preemptive analgesia among clinicians. In this study, we evaluated whether the preemptive use of ketamine decreases post operative pain in patients undergoing appendectomy.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn double-blind, randomized clinical trials, 80 adult male patients undergoing an operation for acute appendicitis were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. In the operating room, patients in the ketamine group received 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine IV 10 minutes before the surgical incision. In the control group, 0.5 mg/kg of normal saline was injected. The pain intensity was assessed at time 0 (immediately after arousal) and 4, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively using the 10 points visual analogue scale (VAS).\n\nRESULTS.\nEighty patients (40 for both groups) were enrolled in this study. For all of the evaluated times, the VAS score was significantly lower in the ketamine group compared to the control. The interval time for the first analgesic request was 23.1 \u00b1 6.7 minutes for the case group and 18.1 \u00b1 7.3 minutes for the control (P = 0.02). The total number of pethidine injections in the first 24 hours postoperatively was 0.6 \u00b1 0.6 for the case group and 2.0 \u00b1 0.8 for the controls (P = 0.032). There were no drug side effects for the case group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nA low dose of intravenously administered ketamine had a preemptive effect in reducing pain after appendectomy.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nEven though previous studies mostly disagreed, many medical professionals believe that giving pain relief before surgery can help reduce pain after the operation. This research looked into whether giving ketamine (a strong painkiller) before appendix removal surgery lessens the pain that patients feel afterwards. \n\nMETHODS:\nWe carried out an anonymous and randomized test on 80 adult male patients receiving emergency appendix removal surgery. The patients were split into two groups. Before the surgery started, the ketamine group were given a measured dose of ketamine through an IV drip, while the control group were given a saltwater injection. We checked the levels of pain they felt right after waking up from the operation, and then at 4, 12 and 24 hours after the surgery. We used a 10-point scale to measure the pain intensity.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe enrolled 80 people into the study, with 40 in both groups. At all the pain measurement times, the group that got ketamine felt less pain than the control group. The time before the first request for pain relief was slightly longer in the ketamine group than in the control group. And fewer people in the ketamine group needed strong pain relief injections in the first 24 hours after surgery. There were no side effects from the ketamine.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nGiving a small amount of ketamine through an IV before surgery seems to help reduce pain after removing the appendix.\n\n## Missing facts\n- The study was double-blind.\n- The operation was for acute appendicitis.\n- The dosage of ketamine given to the patients was 0.5 mg/kg.\n- The ketamine was given 10 minutes before the surgical incision.\n- The patients were in the operating room when they received the ketamine.\n- The substance injected was normal saline.\n- The dosage of normal saline injected was 0.5 mg/kg.\n- The 10 points visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for the assessment.\n- The difference in VAS scores between the ketamine group and the control group was significant.\n- The interval time for the first analgesic request for the case group was 23.1 minutes.\n- The standard deviation of the interval time for the first analgesic request for the case group was 6.7 minutes.\n- The interval time for the first analgesic request for the control group was 18.1 minutes.\n- The standard deviation of the interval time for the first analgesic request for the control group was 7.3 minutes.\n- The difference in the interval times for the first analgesic request between the case group and the control group was statistically significant (P = 0.02).\n- The case group received an average of 0.6 pethidine injections in the first 24 hours postoperatively.\n- The standard deviation of pethidine injections for the case group in the first 24 hours postoperatively was 0.6.\n- The control group received an average of 2.0 pethidine injections in the first 24 hours postoperatively.\n- The standard deviation of pethidine injections for the control group in the first 24 hours postoperatively was 0.8.\n- The difference in the average number of pethidine injections between the case group and the control group in the first 24 hours postoperatively was statistically significant (P = 0.032).\n- The drug has the potential to cause side effects.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
