A demographic checklist and a standard questionnaire covering health-promoting lifestyle, health-related QoL, self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers dimensions were used to gather required data. Independent-samples t test, paired-samples t-test, and ANCOVA were used to analyze the data.\n\nRESULTS.\nAnalysis of covariance showed that after adjusting for effects of pretest scores, the difference between mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale, health-related QoL scale, and all constructs of Pender's health promotion model (self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers) in the intervention group 1 and control group were significant (P< 0.0001). In addition, changes in mean scores of lifestyle scale (42.4 \u00b1 13.6), QoL scale (29.1 \u00b1 14.2), self-efficacy (16.1 \u00b1 2.6), perceived affect (16.1 \u00b1 8), social support (35.4 \u00b1 12.4), and barriers (17.2 \u00b1 15.8) before and after intervention were significant in the intervention group 2 (P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nApplication of family-centered empowerment model among methamphetamine users and their families is practically feasible and can result in enhancement and improvement of their QoL, lifestyle, and health promotion model constructs.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND:\nThis study looks at how involving families in the treatment process can help drug users get better, experience fewer side effects, and improve their quality of life.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nThe aim was to see if educating drug users and their families, using methods grounded in empowerment and health promotion, could enhance their lifestyles and improve their overall health.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nWe tested this on drug users who were getting treatment at a medical center in Tehran. They were split up into three groups: one group of the drug users themselves, one group of their family members, and a third control group. We asked them a series of questions about their lifestyle, health, self confidence, emotions, social support, and potential obstacles.\n\nRESULTS:\nAfter adjusting for previous test scores, there was a significant improvement in the lifestyle, health, and other areas for the drug users and their families who went through the empowerment program. The control group didn't see these changes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nUsing a family-centered empowerment approach with drug users and their families is possible and can lead to better health, improved lifestyle, and more positive attitudes towards health.\n\n## Missing facts\n- Family-centered empowerment is a program for drug and stimulant users.\n- The educational intervention is also based on Pender's health promotion models.\n- The study also focuses on health-related Quality of Life (QoL).\n- The target group of the study is methamphetamine users and their families.\n- A randomized clinical trial was conducted on methamphetamine users.\n- The trial was conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences Substance Abuse Treatment Centers.\n- Methamphetamine users in the trial were in the recovery phase.\n- The methamphetamine users were randomly allocated to three groups.\n- The first group was for training of methamphetamine users who were in recovery phase.\n- The first intervention group consisted of 95 subjects.\n- The second intervention group consisted of 95 subjects.\n- A demographic checklist was used to gather data.\n- A standard questionnaire was used to gather data.\n- The questionnaire covered self-efficacy.\n- An independent-samples t test was used to analyze the data.\n- A paired-samples t-test was used to analyze the data.\n- ANCOVA was used to analyze the data.\n- Multiple statistical tests were used in the analysis.\n- An analysis of covariance was conducted.\n- The analysis also looked at the difference between mean post-test scores of health-related QoL scale.\n- The analysis considered all constructs of Pender's health promotion model.\n- The constructs of Pender's health promotion model include self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers.\n- The difference in mean post-test scores of health-promoting lifestyle scale between the two groups was significant.\n- The difference in mean post-test scores of health-related QoL scale between the two groups was significant.\n- There were changes in the mean scores of the lifestyle scale in intervention group 2.\n- The mean score of the lifestyle scale was 42.4 \u00b1 13.6.\n- There were changes in the mean scores of the QoL scale in intervention group 2.\n- The mean score of the QoL scale was 29.1 \u00b1 14.2.\n- There were changes in the mean scores of self-efficacy in intervention group 2.\n- The mean score of self-efficacy was 16.1 \u00b1 2.6.\n- There were changes in the mean scores of perceived affect in intervention group 2.\n- The mean score of perceived affect was 16.1 \u00b1 8.\n- There were changes in the mean scores of social support in intervention group 2.\n- The family-centered empowerment model can be applied among methamphetamine users and their families.\n- The application of this model is practically feasible.\n- The application of the family-centered empowerment model can enhance health promotion model constructs for methamphetamine users and their families.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
