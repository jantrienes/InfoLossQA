Properly designed controlled trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of these practices. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early phase trial. Fifty patients seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program were randomly assigned to a daily soy or placebo (casein) shake. Outcome measures were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. Analysis was with standard statistics based on the null hypothesis, and separation test for early phase CAM comparative trials. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. Use of standard statistics with intent-to-treat analysis showed that total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group (P = .02) and by 18% in the placebo group (P < .001). The difference in change in scores between the groups was not significant (P = .16). With the same analysis, CES-D scores decreased in the soy group by 16% (P = .004) and in the placebo group by 15% (P = .05). The change in scores was similar in the groups (P = .83). Results of statistical analysis using the separation test and intent-to-treat analysis revealed no benefit of soy compared with placebo. Shakes that contain soy and shakes that contain casein, when combined with a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program, provide a decrease in fibromyalgia symptoms. Separation between the effects of soy and casein (control) shakes did not favor the intervention. Therefore, large-sample studies using soy for patients with fibromyalgia are probably not indicated.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looked at whether using soy products could help people with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body, to feel better. The researchers randomly divided 50 people with fibromyalgia into two groups. One group drank a soy shake every day, and the other group drank a placebo shake (containing casein, a protein found in milk) that didn't contain any soy. They compared how the two groups were doing both before the study started and after six weeks of drinking the shakes.\n\nThe main result was that both groups felt somewhat better after six weeks, but there was no real difference between the people who drank the soy shakes and those who drank the placebo shakes. The researchers concluded that, based on these results, there's probably no point in doing bigger studies to see whether soy is useful for people with fibromyalgia, because it didn't seem to make a difference in this study.\n\n## Missing facts\n- These patients use medicine.\n- The type of medicine used by most fibromyalgia patients is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).\n- These trials need to be properly designed.\n- The study was double-blind.\n- The study was an early phase trial.\n- The patients are seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program.\n- The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was used as an outcome measure.\n- The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used as an outcome measure.\n- The analysis used standard statistics.\n- A separation test was used in the analysis.\n- The separation test was for early phase CAM comparative trials.\n- Standard statistics were used in the analysis.\n- Total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group.\n- The decrease in FIQ scores in the soy group was statistically significant with a P value of .02.\n- Total FIQ scores decreased by 18% in the placebo group.\n- The decrease in FIQ scores in the placebo group was highly statistically significant with a P value less than .001.\n- The groups had scores that changed.\n- The P-value of the difference in change in scores between the groups was .16.\n- CES-D scores decreased in the soy group.\n- The decrease in CES-D scores in the soy group was 16%.\n- The decrease in CES-D scores in the soy group was statistically significant with a P-value of .004.\n- CES-D scores decreased in the placebo group.\n- The decrease in CES-D scores in the placebo group was 15%.\n- The decrease in CES-D scores in the placebo group was statistically significant with a P-value of .05.\n- The measurement of the similarity in score changes resulted in a P-value of .83.\n- The separation test was used in the analysis.\n- Shakes that contain soy can be combined with a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program.\n- Shakes that contain casein can be combined with a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program.\n- The combination of soy shakes and a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program can decrease fibromyalgia symptoms.\n- The combination of casein shakes and a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program can decrease fibromyalgia symptoms.\n- Large-sample studies are being considered for patients with fibromyalgia.\n\nThe above facts are missing from the simplified text (\"Simplification\").
