Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are frequent comorbidities and, like metabolic syndrome, increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Telmisartan, an antihypertensive agent with evidence of partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) activity, may improve insulin sensitivity and lipid profile in patients with metabolic syndrome.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized study, patients with World Health Organization criteria for metabolic syndrome received once-daily doses of telmisartan (80 mg, n = 20) or losartan (50 mg, n = 20) for 3 months. At baseline and end of treatment, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity, glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) and 24-hour mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were determined.\n\nRESULTS.\nTelmisartan, but not losartan, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced free plasma glucose, free plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and HbAic. Following treatment, plasma glucose and insulin were reduced during the oral glucose tolerance test by telmisartan, but not by losartan. Telmisartan also significantly reduced 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) compared with losartan.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAs well as providing superior 24-hour blood pressure control, telmisartan, unlike losartan, displayed insulin-sensitizing activity, which may be explained by its partial PPAR\u03b3 activity.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nMetabolic syndrome is a mix of health conditions that can put you at risk of heart disease. It includes things like high blood pressure and the body's resistance to insulin, a hormone that manages the sugar in your body. Both high blood pressure and a type of diabetes are often found with metabolic syndrome and they make the risk of heart disease even higher. Telmisartan is a medication taken to lower high blood pressure, and it might also help the body respond better to insulin and improve blood fat levels in people with metabolic syndrome.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a study which kept the patients and researchers blind to the treatment received, people with metabolic syndrome criteria defined by the World Health Organization were given either Telmisartan or another high blood pressure medication called Losartan daily for three months. At the beginning and end of treatment, we measured fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, insulin responsiveness, the percentage of sugar coating on red blood cells (HbA1c), and average blood pressures throughout a day.\n\nRESULTS.\nTelmisartan was found to notably lower fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin, the measure of insulin resistance, and HbA1c. After taking Telmisartan, patients had lower blood sugar and insulin levels after eating sugar, which wasn't the case with Losartan. Telmisartan also significantly lowered the average blood pressure throughout the day, more so than Losartan.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBesides better control of blood pressure throughout the day, Telmisartan was found to enhance the body's insulin response while Losartan did not. This could be related to Telmisartan's potential to partially provoke a specific activity in the body (PPAR\u03b3).", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts":

DESIGN.\nDepot somatostatin analogues are well accepted as either adjuvant or primary therapy for acromegaly, and their long dosage intervals facilitate adherence to treatment. Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg, every 4\u20138 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1\u20132 weeks.\n\nPATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.\nPatients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, \u2265 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nNinety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77\u00b77%). Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae than with lanreotide microparticles (3\u00b78 (0\u00b75) vs 4\u00b73 (0\u00b75) ng/ml; P < 0\u00b7001). GH levels < 2\u00b75 ng/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH < 2\u00b75 ng/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and treatment was well accepted.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4\u20138 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7\u201314 days.", "simplification": "GOAL AND PLAN\nThe goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.\nWe asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogel\u00ae every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nNinety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the Autogel\u00ae than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the Autogel\u00ae and patients were happy with the treatment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks works just as well and is as well tolerated as using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every one to two weeks in treating acromegaly.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN.", "start": 0, "end": 21, "facts":

and overall quality of life. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the antidepressant paroxetine on metabolic control, quality of life and mental well-being in mildly depressed women with type 2 diabetes.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe randomised 15 mildly depressed women with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes to a 10-week single-blind treatment with either paroxetine 20 mg per day or placebo. Primary efficacy measurements were glycemic control and quality of life. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (GHbA1c) was used as a measure of glycemic control. Quality of life was evaluated using RAND-36. Mental state was assessed using two clinician-rated scoring instruments, Hamilton's Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Montgomery-A\u030asberg's Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and a patient-rated scoring instrument, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI).\n\nRESULTS.\nAt the end of the study no significant difference between groups in improvement of quality of life was found. A trend towards a superior improvement in glycemic control was found in the paroxetine group (p = 0.08). A superior increase in sex-hormone-binding-globuline (SHBG) levels was evidenced in the paroxetine group (p = 0.01) as a sign of improved insulin sensitivity. There was also a trend for superior efficacy of paroxetine in investigator-rated anxiety and depression. This notion was supported by a trend for superior decrease of serum cortisol levels in the paroxetine group (p = 0.06).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nParoxetine has a beneficial effect on measures of insulin sensitivity and may improve glycemic control. Larger studies of longer duration are needed to verify the benefits of paroxetine in type 2 diabetes. While waiting for more conclusive evidence it seems sensible to augment standard care of type 2 diabetes with paroxetine even in patients who do not fulfil routine psychiatric criteria for initiation of antidepressant drug treatment.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND:\nPeople with type 2 diabetes often also struggle with depression. This depression can make it harder for them to keep their blood sugar levels in check and reduce their quality of life. This study wanted to see if an antidepressant drug called paroxetine could help these people by improving their blood sugar control, quality of life, and mental health.\n\nMETHODS:\nThe study included 15 women with type 2 diabetes who were a little depressed and not succeeding at controlling their blood sugar. These women were randomly picked to take paroxetine or a placebo for 10 weeks. The researchers then checked to see how well their blood sugar was controlled and their quality of life using several techniques including a blood test, a popular health survey, and mental health evaluations.\n\nRESULTS:\nAt the end of the study, there wasn't a big difference in the quality of life improvements between the two groups. However, the group taking paroxetine seemed to have slightly better blood sugar control. They also saw an increase in a protein that indicates improved insulin sensitivity, meaning their bodies could use insulin more effectively. Additionally, the paroxetine group showed signs of reduced anxiety and depression, as well as a decrease in a stress hormone.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nParoxetine might help improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Larger and longer studies are needed to confirm these benefits. But until then, it might make sense to add paroxetine to the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes patients, even if they're not extremely depressed.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence":

opiates. There are a number of detoxification agents but no recommended drug of choice. The purpose of this study is to compare buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for detoxification from illicit opiates in primary care.\n\nMETHODS.\nOpen label randomised controlled trial in NHS Primary Care (General Practices), Leeds, UK. Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six months post detoxification were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nOnly 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Risk of non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35\u20130.96, p = 0.065). A higher proportion of people allocated to buprenorphine provided a clean urine sample compared with those who received dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33\u20133.21, p = 0.028). People allocated to buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and more were abstinent at three months (10 vs 4, RR 1.55 CI 0.96\u20132.52) and six months post detoxification (7 vs 3, RR 1.45 CI 0.84\u20132.49).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nInformative randomised trials evaluating routine care within the primary care setting are possible amongst drug using populations.

There are many medicines available to help with this, but no one is sure which is the best. This study compares two drugs, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which is better at helping people stop using illegal drugs.\n\nMETHODS:\nThis study included 60 adults in Leeds, UK, who were using illegal drugs and wanted to stop. They were randomly chosen to receive either buprenorphine or dihydrocodeine. The way the drugs were reduced over time depended on what the prescribing doctor thought was best, but it was not supposed to be more than 15 days. The main goal was to see if the person stopped using illegal drugs by the end of the treatment, which was checked by a urine test. They also looked at what happened during the treatment and three and six months afterwards.\n\nRESULTS:\nOnly 23% of the people finished their drug detox treatment and gave a urine sample at the end. If people were given buprenorphine, they were more likely to finish the detox treatment. Those given buprenorphine were also more likely to have a clean urine sample, meaning they stopped using illegal drugs. They also needed to see healthcare professionals less often during treatment and more were still not using drugs three and six months later.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nWith help, it is possible to set up good quality trials in the regular healthcare setting for people using drugs.

Different stages of this process, throughout which employees either dropped out or were excluded, were described and compared with the subjective selection process. Characteristics of ineligible and ultimately selected employees, for a randomized trial, were described and quantified using sickness absence data.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall response rate on the screening instrument was 42.0%. Response bias was found for the parameters sex and age, but not for sickness absence. Sickness absence was higher in the 'at risk' (N = 212) group (42%) compared to the 'not at risk' (N = 2503) group (25%) (OR 2.17 CI 1.63\u20132.89; p = 0.000). The selection process ended with the successful inclusion of 151 eligible, i.e. 2% of the approached employees in the trial.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study shows that objective selection of employees for early intervention is effective.

The researchers think that those chosen based on solid evidence are more likely to be at risk of taking sick days, making them the ideal candidates for the program.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe researchers started by sending out 8603 surveys to begin the evidence-based selection process. They detailed and compared the different steps in this process, which involved some workers not completing the process or being ruled out, to the hunch-based selection. They studied and noted down certain characteristics of the workers who couldn't join and those who were eventually chosen for a test experiment using data regarding sick leave.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe overall response to the survey was 42.0%. There was bias in answering the survey when it came to sex and age, but not for sick leave. The rate of sick leave was higher in the 'at risk' group (42%) as compared to the 'not at risk' group (25%). The selection process ended successfully with 151 workers, or 2% of those contacted, included in the test.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study found that selecting workers for this kind of program based on solid evidence is effective.

One possible treatment for this pain is a drug called botulinum toxin, but good quality research is lacking on its effectiveness. So, we ran a scientifically robust study to find out if botulinum toxin really does help reduce neck pain in these patients.\n\nMETHODS\nWe had 40 patients who all had long-term whiplash injury. They were randomly put into two groups. One group had injections of botulinum toxin and the other group had injections of a harmless saltwater solution (the placebo) into their painful neck muscles.\n\nRESULTS\nWe checked on the patients after 12 weeks and found no big differences between the two groups. We looked at how intense their neck pain was, how many days they had neck pain, how many hours a day they had neck pain, how many days they needed treatment to relieve their symptoms, how many painkillers they took each day, and how much they could move their necks. There was also no big difference in how much the patients felt they had improved over the 4, 8 and 12 weeks of the study.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on our results, we couldn't say that botulinum toxin is effective in treating neck pain in people with long-term whiplash.

resistance. To investigate the prevalence of the CLR resistance-related A2143G mutation of the H. pylori-specific 23S rRNA gene in Chinese subjects with and without CLR use history, 307 subjects received the treatment with amoxicillin and omeprazole (OA) and 310 subjects received a placebo in 1995, and 153 subjects received a triple therapy with OA and CLR (OAC) in 2000. DNA was extracted from fasting gastric juice at the end of the intervention trial in 2003. H. pylori infection was determined by H. pylori-specific 23S rRNA PCR, ELISA, and13C-urea breath test assays. Mutations of the 23S rRNA gene were detected by RFLP assays.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe presence of 23S rRNA due to H. pylori infection in the OA group remained lower than that in the placebo group 7.3 yrs after OA-therapy [51.1% (157/307) vs. 83.9% (260/310), p = 0.0000]. In the OAC group, the 23S rRNA detection rate was 26.8% (41/153) three yrs after OAC-treatment. The A2143G mutation rate among the 23S rRNA-positive subjects in the OAC group [31.7% (13/41)] was significantly higher than that in the OA group [10.2% (16/157)] and the placebo group [13.8% (36/260)]. The frequency of the AAGGG \u2192 CTTCA (2222\u20132226) and AACC \u2192 GAAG (2081\u20132084) sequence alterations in the OAC group was also significantly higher than those in the OA group and the placebo group.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPrimary prevalence of the A2143G mutation was 10~14% among Chinese population without history of CLR therapy. Administration of CLR to eliminate H. pylori infection increased the prevalence of the A2143G mutation in Chinese subjects (32%) significantly.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looked at how a specific genetic change (known as an A2143G mutation) in the bacteria H. pylori, which causes stomach ulcers, can make it resistant to the antibiotic clarithromycin (CLR). To find out how common this resistant change is in China, the researchers tested 617 people who had received treatments in 1995. Half had been given amoxicillin and omeprazole (OA), drugs that can treat the bacteria, while the other half got a placebo \u2013 a harmless substance with no medical effect. In 2000, the team gave 153 more people a three-drug treatment featuring OA and CLR. Then, in 2003 they examined DNA from the subjects' stomach juice to see if they still had the bacteria and if it had developed resistance.\n\nRESULTS.\nThree years after the triple-drug treatment, the research found that about 27% of those people still had H. pylori in their system. Among these, about 32% had the resistant A2143G mutation. This was a higher rate than both those who got the two-drug treatment (about 10%) and those who got the placebo (around 14%). The three-drug treatment group also had higher rates of other DNA sequence changes.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe results showed that about 10-14% of Chinese people without treatment history had the antibiotic-resistant mutation. When they used CLR to get rid of the bacteria, the rate of the resistant mutation rose significantly to 32%.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []},

artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are now the most frequently recommended first line treatments for uncomplicated malaria in Africa. Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD) was a potential alternative for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. A comparison of the efficacy and safety of these three drug combinations was necessary to make evidence based drug treatment policies.\n\nMETHODS.\nFive hundred and thirty-four, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal children were randomised in blocks of 15 to the AS+AQ, AL or AS+CD groups. Administration of study drugs was supervised by project staff and the children were followed up at r home on days 1,2,3,7,14 and 28 post treatment. Parasitological and clinical failures and adverse events were compared between the study groups.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS.\nIn a per-protocol analysis, the parasitological and clinical failure rate at day 28 post treatment (PCF28) was lower in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or AS+CD groups (corrected for re-infections: 6.6% vs 13.8% and 13.8% respectively, p = 0.08; uncorrected: 14.6% vs 27.6% and 28.1% respectively, p = 0.005). In the intention to treat analysis, the rate of early treatment failure was high in all three groups (AS+AQ 13.3%; AL 15.2%; and AS+CD 9.3%, p = 0.2) primarily due to vomiting. However, the PCF28 corrected for re-infection was lower, though not significantly, in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or the AS+CD groups (AS+AQ 18.3%; AL 24.2%; AS+CD 20.8%, p = 0.4) The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAS+AQ is an appropriate first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Ghana and possibly in the neighbouring countries in West Africa. The effectiveness of AL in routine programme conditions needs to be studied further in West Africa.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00119145", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study is about comparing three different drug combinations used to treat uncomplicated malaria. These combinations are Artesunate+amodiaquine (AS+AQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), and Artesunate+chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS+CD). Comparing the effectiveness and safety of these treatments will help make decisions about which medication to recommend for treating malaria.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested these three combinations on 534 children who were otherwise healthy. The children were divided into three groups, each receiving one of the drug combinations. They were watched closely by our project staff who delivered the medicines. We checked on them several times after the treatment - 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days later. We were looking for whether the medication failed to get rid of the malaria, and if any child had negative side effects from the medication.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS.\nWhen comparing the results, less children in the AS+AQ group had failed treatments and signs of malaria compared to the other two groups. However, many children in all three groups threw up after taking the medication. It should be noted that the AS+AQ group's treatment failure rate was lower, though not significantly. It also helps to know, the overall rate of side effects was similar in all groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBased on our findings, AS+AQ seems to be a suitable first choice for treating uncomplicated malaria in Ghana or in West African countries. The effectiveness of the AL combination needs to be further studied in this region.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number NCT00119145.",

We tested this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized, single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the length of postoperative stay in hospital.\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-three patients undergoing high-risk surgery were randomized either to a control group (group C, n = 16) or to an intervention group (group I, n = 17). In group I, \u0394PP was continuously monitored during surgery by a multiparameter bedside monitor and minimized to 10% or less by volume loading.\n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in terms of demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiology score, type, and duration of surgery. During surgery, group I received more fluid than group C (4,618 \u00b1 1,557 versus 1,694 \u00b1 705 ml (mean \u00b1 SD), P < 0.0001), and \u0394PP decreased from 22 \u00b1 75 to 9 \u00b1 1% (P < 0.05) in group I. The median duration of postoperative stay in hospital (7 versus 17 days, P < 0.01) was lower in group I than in group C.

One way to achieve this is by using a ventilator to regulate the pressure changes in the blood vessels during these operations. Our research aimed to find out if this method could shorten the length of a patient's stay in the hospital after surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a study that involved 33 patients who were due for major surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group, made up of 16 patients, was treated normally and served as our basis for comparison. In the second group of 17 patients, we kept track of their blood pressure changes using a special monitor during surgery, and ensured that these changes remained small by giving them a lot of fluids.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe two patient groups were similar in their demographic data, overall health condition, type of surgery, and surgery duration. Throughout the surgery, we noticed that the second group received more fluid and experienced a decline in their blood pressure changes. Also, this group generally spent less time in the hospital after surgery (7 days instead of 17). They also had fewer complications, spent less time on ventilators (1 day instead of 5), and stayed in the ICU for a shorter period (3 days instead of 9). \n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings suggest that if we carefully monitor and control blood pressure changes by giving plenty of fluids during major surgery, it can improve the recovery outcomes. This includes reducing the number of complications, the length of time on a ventilator, and the duration of the hospital and ICU stay.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT00479011", "original_sentences":

Open pyeloplasty remains the standard against which new technique must be compared. We compared laparoscopic (LP) and open pyeloplasty (OP) in a randomized prospective trial.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nA prospective randomized study was done from January 2004 to January 2007 in which a total of 28 laparoscopic and 34 open pyeloplasty were done. All laparoscopic pyeloplasties were performed transperitoneally. Standard open Anderson Hynes pyeloplasty, spiral flap or VY plasty was done depending on anatomic consideration. Patients were followed with DTPA scan at three months and IVP at six months. Perioperative parameters including operative time, analgesic use, hospital stay, and complication and success rates were compared.\n\nRESULTS.\nMean total operative time with stent placement in LP group was 244.2 min (188-300 min) compared to 122 min (100-140 min) in OP group. Compared to OP group, the post operative diclofenac requirement was significantly less in LP group (mean 107.14 mg) and OP group required mean of (682.35 mg). The duration of analgesic requirement was also significantly less in LP group. The postoperative hospital stay in LP was mean 3.14 Days (2-7 days) significantly less than the open group mean of 8.29 days (7-11 days).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nLP has a minimal level of morbidity and short hospital stay compared to open approach.

The traditional treatment is a type of surgery known as open pyeloplasty. In this study, we compared this traditional treatment to a newer technique called laparoscopic pyeloplasty.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, we performed 28 laparoscopic and 34 open pyeloplasty surgeries. The laparoscopic surgeries were performed through the abdominal cavity. The traditional surgeries were done based on the patient's specific needs. After surgery, we monitored patients with scans. We also compared how long the surgeries took, how much pain medication was used, how long patients stayed in the hospital, and the rates of complications and success.\n\nRESULTS.\nOn average, the laparoscopic surgeries took longer. However, the patients who had laparoscopic surgery needed significantly less pain medication and stayed in the hospital for a shorter amount of time.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nLaparoscopic surgery has some downsides, such as the longer surgery time and the advanced skills required. However, these surgeries have lower risks and quicker recovery times.

preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of etanercept therapy to prolong endogenous insulin production in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nThis was a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at the Diabetes Center, Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo. Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8\u201318.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3\u201318 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C >6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000\u201310,000, platelets >100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n\nRESULTS.\nA1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 \u00b1 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 \u00b1 1.2%; P < 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 \u00b1 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 \u00b1 0.21; P < 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P < 0.05). From baseline to week 24 insulin dose decreased 18% in the etanercept group compared with a 23% increase in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of \u03b2-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.", "simplification": "GOAL.\nThe goal of this study was to test if a drug called etanercept could help children with newly detected type 1 diabetes continue making their own insulin for longer.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN. \nThis was a six-month experiment carried out at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo's Diabetes Center. A diverse group of 18 kids aged between 7.8-18.2 years participated. They were randomly split into two groups. One group received etanercept, and the other got a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect). The researchers used standard criteria, including age, health status, insulin injections, and general health markers to select the participants. They treated all participants equally whether they finished the study or not.\n\nFINDINGS. \nAt the end of the study, the group that received etanercept had a lower average blood sugar level and seemed to be making more of their own insulin than the placebo group. Their average insulin dose decreased by 18%, while the placebo group's average dose increased by 23%. Importantly, none of the patients dropped out due to side effects from the etanercept.\n\nCONCLUSIONS. \nThis small preliminary study suggests that etanercept might help children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes maintain their ability to produce insulin. Therefore, etanercept might delay the point at which patients need to rely entirely on insulin injections. More extensive research is needed to confirm this possibility and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE.", "start": 0,

The fast track area is a novel method which aims to reduce waiting time, patient dissatisfaction and morbidity. |The study objective was to determine the impact of a fast track area (FTA) on both effectiveness measures (i.e. waiting times [WT] and length of stay [LOS]) and quality measures (i.e. LWBS rates and mortality rates) in non-urgent patients. The secondary objective was to assess if a FTA negatively impacted on urgent patients entering the ED.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study took place in a 500 bed, urban, tertiary care hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This was a quasi-experimental, which examined the impact of a FTA on a pre-intervention control group (January 2005) (n = 4,779) versus a post-intervention study group (January 2006) (n = 5,706).\n\nRESULTS.\nMean WTs of Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS) 4 patients decreased by 22 min (95% CI 21 min to 24 min, P < 0.001). Similarly, mean WTs of CTAS 5 patients decreased by 28 min (95% CI 19 min to 37 min, P < 0.001) post FTA. The mean WTs of urgent patients (CTAS 2/3) were also significantly reduced after the FTA was opened (P < 0.001). The LWBS rate was reduced from 4.7% to 0.7% (95% CI 3.37 to 4.64; P < 0.001). Opening a FTA had no significant impact on mortality rates (P = 0.88).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe FTA improved ED effectiveness (WTs and LOS) and quality measures (LWBS rates) whereas mortality rate remained unchanged.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nEmergency departments (EDs) in hospitals are often crowded, which can lead to longer waiting times and unhappy patients. To solve this problem, a new method called a 'fast track area' (FTA) was tested. This method is designed to reduce the amount of time patients wait and boost their satisfaction. The study was looking to see if this new area would really help with these factors. It also checked to see if this new area would negatively affect more urgent cases in the ED.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study was conducted at a 500-bed hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It compared the waiting times and satisfaction rates of two groups: one before the FTA was introduced (in January 2005) and one after (in January 2006).\n\nRESULTS.\nThe results showed that after the FTA was introduced, patients rated as less urgent in the ED waited 22 minutes less, on average. The very least urgent patients waited 28 minutes less. Even the more urgent cases benefited from shorter waiting times. The number of patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) dropped significantly from 4.7% to 0.7%. There was no notable change in the death rates after the FTA was opened.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOverall, having a FTA in the ED helped to reduce waiting times and the rate of patients leaving without being seen, while the death rate didn't change.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a ubiquitous

All patients underwent a diagnostic cystoscopy. Patients were then randomized into 2 groups: One group that did not receive antibiotics (100 patients) and the other group that received antibiotic treatment (100 patients with a single intravenous dose of cefoperazone). All patients had urine analysis and urine cultures on the second day after the operation. Additionally, clinical parameters including fever and dysuria were recorded. In 15% of the patients, incidental additional interventions such as punch biopsy or TUR of a small bladder tumor that were similarly distributed in both groups were performed.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn 1 patient from the antibiotic group and 2 patients from the no prophylaxis group, the urine cultures after cystoscopy were positive. No statistically significant difference was observed between these groups based on the microbiological and clinical parameters.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe current study provides evidence that no antibiotic prophylaxis is required before diagnostic cystoscopy in patients without bacteriuria.

In 15% of the patients, other procedures like a biopsy or small tumor removal were also conducted.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found bacteria in the urine of 1 patient who got antibiotics and 2 who didn't. But this difference was too small to conclude anything significant. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings suggest that antibiotics might not be necessary before a bladder check-up in patients who don't have bacteria in urine.

with calcium are increasingly available, the calcium content of calcium-fortified foods may not be adequately captured in traditional assessments of dietary intake, such as dietary records analyzed with commercially available software. The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P < .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P < .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P < .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P < .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P < .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P < .001). Dairy was the primary calcium source for both groups (55% of intake for black women and 57% of intake for white women).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CFFFQ can be used to identify postmenopausal women with inadequate calcium intakes (<800 mg/d) and to identify key sources of dietary calcium. Older black women consume less daily calcium than do older white women.", "simplification": "INTRODUCTION:\nMore and more foods are being boosted with extra calcium. Because of this, it might be hard for traditional methods that measure how much calcium a person gets from their food to accurately work out how much they're really getting, especially if these methods are using off-the-shelf software. We wanted to create and test a special questionnaire that focused on calcium intake, which would also take into account foods naturally full of calcium and those that have extra calcium added to them. We also wanted to take a closer look at where black and white women going through menopause, in particular, get their calcium from and whether or not they're getting enough.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years. They were asked to recall everything they've eaten in the last 24 hours and then answer our 46-item special calcium questionnaire. \n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that the daily calcium intake measured by our questionnaire strongly matched with the 24-hour food recall. Interestingly, our questionnaire showed a higher total daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall. As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall underestimated the amount of calcium intake compared to our questionnaire. Our results also showed that dairy was the main source of calcium for both black and white women. Though our questionnaire estimated a higher amount of calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall, it was more accurate in identifying low calcium intakes.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur special questionnaire can be used to find out if women going through menopause are not getting enough calcium in their diet (less than 800 milligrams per day). Additionally, it can shed light on the main sources of dietary calcium. We also found that older black women tend to consume less daily calcium than older white women.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "INTRODUCTION.", "start": 0, "end": 13, "facts": []}, {"sentence":

attributed to sepsis and multiple organ failure, as well as immobilization. Recent studies have shown that electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) may be an alternative to active exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with myopathy. The aim of our study was to investigate the EMS effects on muscle mass preservation of critically ill patients with the use of ultrasonography (US).\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-nine critically ill patients (age: 59 \u00b1 21 years) with an APACHE II admission score \u226513 were randomly assigned after stratification upon admission to receive daily EMS sessions of both lower extremities (EMS-group) or to the control group (control group). Muscle mass was evaluated with US, by measuring the cross sectional diameter (CSD) of the vastus intermedius and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps muscle.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-six patients were finally evaluated. Right rectus femoris and right vastus intermedius CSD decreased in both groups (EMS group: from 1.42 \u00b1 0.48 to 1.31 \u00b1 0.45 cm, P = 0.001 control group: from 1.59 \u00b1 0.53 to 1.37 \u00b1 0.5 cm, P = 0.002; EMS group: from 0.91 \u00b1 0.39 to 0.81 \u00b1 0.38 cm, P = 0.001 control group: from 1.40 \u00b1 0.64 to 1.11 \u00b1 0.56 cm, P = 0.004, respectively). However, the CSD of the right rectus femoris decreased significantly less in the EMS group (-0.11 \u00b1 0.06 cm, -8 \u00b1 3.9%) as compared to the control group (-0.21 \u00b1 0.10 cm, -13.9 \u00b1 6.4%; P < 0.05) and the CSD of the right vastus intermedius decreased significantly less in the EMS group (-0.10 \u00b1 0.05 cm, -12.5 \u00b1 7.4%) as compared to the control group (-0.29 \u00b1 0.28 cm, -21.5 \u00b1 15.3%; P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEMS is well tolerated and seems to preserve the muscle mass of critically ill patients. The potential use of EMS as a preventive and rehabilitation tool in ICU patients with polyneuromyopathy needs to be further investigated.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nclinicaltrials.gov: NCT00882830", "simplification": "INTRODUCTION.\nPeople who are seriously sick, especially those in intensive care units, often lose a lot of muscle mass due to their illness and the long periods of time they spend without moving. Some studies have suggested that electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), a procedure that uses small electrical currents to make the muscles contract, could be a good substitute for exercise in patients with chronic lung or heart disease who also suffer from muscle weakness. Our study was designed to find out if EMS can help seriously ill patients keep their muscle mass, measured using ultrasound.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied 49 very sick patients, around 59 years old on average, who scored 13 or more on a scale measuring severity of illness. The patients were randomly divided into two groups when they arrived at the hospital: one that received daily EMS treatment on both legs, and a control group that did not receive the treatment. To evaluate the muscle mass, we used ultrasound to measure the thickness of two muscles in the thigh.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn the end, 26 patients were fully evaluated. Both groups lost some muscle mass, but the group treated with EMS lost significantly less muscle mass than the control group. Specifically, the two thigh muscles we measured shrank less in the EMS group than in the control group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEMS appears to be well received by patients and seems to help very sick patients maintain their muscle mass. This suggests that it could be a useful tool to prevent muscle loss and help with rehabilitation in this patient group. However, we need to do further research to fully understand its potential uses.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis clinical trial has been registered: NCT00882830.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence":

Plasmodium vivax infection, the parasite responsible for the majority of its malaria burden. Chloroquine resistance in P. vivax is emerging in Asia. Therapeutic responses across Afghanistan have not been evaluated in detail.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween July 2007 and February 2009, an open-label, randomized controlled trial of chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in patients aged three months and over with slide-confirmed P. vivax mono-infections was conducted. Consistent with current national guidelines, primaquine was not administered. Subjects were followed up daily during the acute phase of illness (days 0-3) and weekly until day 56. The primary endpoint was the overall cumulative parasitological failure rate at day 56 after the start of treatment, with the hypothesis being that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was non-inferior compared to chloroquine (\u0394 = 5% difference in proportion of failures).\n\nRESULTS.\nOf 2,182 individuals with positive blood films for P. vivax, 536 were enrolled in the trial. The day 28 cure rate was 100% in both treatment groups. Parasite clearance was more rapid with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine than chloroquine. At day 56, there were more recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm (8.9%, 95% CI 6.0-13.1%) than the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-5.8%), a difference in cumulative recurrence rate of 6.1% (2-sided 90%CI +2.6 to +9.7%). The log-rank test comparing the survival curves confirmed the superiority of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over chloroquine (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that a lower initial haemoglobin concentration was also independently associated with recurrence. Both regimens were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nChloroquine remains an efficacious treatment for the treatment of vivax malaria in Afghanistan. In a setting where radical therapy cannot be administered, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine provides additional benefit in terms of post-treatment prophylaxis, reducing the incidence of recurrence from 4-8 weeks after treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT00682578.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nIn Afghanistan, the standard treatment for most cases of malaria (a disease caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite) is a drug called chloroquine. But some malaria parasites in Asia are becoming resistant to this drug. The effectiveness of the drug in Afghanistan hasn't been extensively tested.\n\nMETHODS.\nFrom July 2007 to February 2009, we ran a study on patients who were at least three months old and had malaria. We tested the effect of chloroquine and another drug called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. We checked them daily at first, then weekly for eight weeks. We saw which treatment was better at preventing the malaria parasite from returning.\n\nRESULTS.\nOut of 2,182 people with malaria that we found, 536 took part in the test. After four weeks, everyone in both treatment groups was cured. But we saw that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine cured the disease faster. After eight weeks, fewer people in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group got sick again. Both treatments were safe and didn\u2019t make anyone seriously ill.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe chloroquine drug is still good for treating malaria in Afghanistan. The alternative drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine can also give extra protection stopping the disease from coming back.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nWe registered this trial online at ClinicalTrials.gov,

received adjuvant post-operative tamoxifen (TAM). This study was aimed to evaluate the role of late TAM in these patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nFrom 1997 to 2003, patients aged 35 to 75 years, operated more than 2 years previously for monolateral breast cancer without adjuvant TAM, with no signs of metastases and no contraindication to TAM were randomized to TAM 20 mg/day orally for 2 years or follow-up alone. Events were categorized as locoregional relapse, distant metastases, metachronous breast cancer, tumours other than breast cancer and death from any causes, whichever occurred first. The sample size (197 patients per arm, plus 10% allowance) was based on the assumption of a 30% decrease in the number of events occurring at a rate of 5% annually in the 10 years following randomization. Four hundred and thirty-three patients were randomized in the study (TAM 217, follow-up 216). Patients characteristics (TAM/follow-up) included: median age 55/55 years, median time from surgery 25/25 months (range, 25-288/25-294), in situ carcinoma 18/24, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive in 75/68, negative in 70/57, unknown in 72/91 patients. Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients.\n\nRESULTS.\nThirty-six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 month, mostly because of subjective intolerance. Eighty-three events (TAM 39, follow-up 44) occurred: locoregional relapse in 10/8, distant metastases in 14/16, metachronous breast cancer in 4/10, other tumours in 11/10 patients. Less ER-positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than in follow-up patients (1 vs 10, p = 0.005). Event-free survival was similar in both groups of patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous ER-positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients. No other statistically significant differences have emerged thus far.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looked at breast cancer patients who, for different reasons, didn't receive a common follow-up treatment called Tamoxifen after their surgery. The aim was to see what role, if any, Tamoxifen could still play for these patients if given later.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween 1997 and 2003, we looked at patients aged 35-75 who had had surgery for one-sided breast cancer more than 2 years before. These patients didn't have any signs of the cancer spreading and were healthy enough to take Tamoxifen. They were split into two groups: one received 20 mg/day of Tamoxifen for two years, and the other did not. We tracked various outcomes including local and distant cancer recurrence, new breast cancers, other types of cancer, and death. We based our sample size on the hypothesis that taking Tamoxifen would result in 30% fewer events occurring over 10 years. The study included 433 people, 217 took Tamoxifen while 216 did not. The patient's characteristics were very similar in both groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThirty-six patients stopped taking Tamoxifen after about a month, mainly due to not tolerating it well. Eighty-three significant events occurred: 10 local and 16 distant cancer recurrences, 14 new breast cancers, and 21 other cancers. In the Tamoxifen group, fewer patients developed new estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers (1 vs 10). However, the two groups showed similar overall health progress.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe 5-year analysis showed that fewer patients in the Tamoxifen group developed new estrogen-receptor positive cancers.

OBJECTIVES.\nTo assess the efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile and to compare the clinical outcomes of flapless implant therapy on immediate loading (IL) implants to delayed loading (DL) implants.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study sample consisted of 20 patients who were partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into two groups. In group I (IL) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (DL) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the IL group and two-piece implants were used for the DL group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), papillary index (PPI), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (WKM) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe success rate in group I was found to be 80%, which was lower than the success rate in group II which was found to be 90%. On comparison, there is no statistically significant difference in success rate between the two study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like mPI, mBI, ML and WKM. The mean PPI score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe results of this study indicated that flapless implant surgery using either immediately loading implants or DL implants, demonstrate enhancement of implant esthetics.", "simplification": "GOAL AND PURPOSE.\nThe goal of this study was to understand how effective a specific type of dental implant surgery, known as flapless implant surgery, is in improving the appearance of the soft tissues in the mouth. We also compared the performance of two types of implants - ones that are immediately put to use (IL) versus those that are left to adjust for a while (DL).\n\nHOW WE DID THE STUDY.\nWe conducted this study with 20 patients who were missing some teeth in the front part of their upper mouth. We split them into two groups. In the first group (IL), we placed 10 implants that we immediately put to use and fitted with a permanent crown after 14 days. In the second group (DL), we placed 10 implants but only started using them after 4 months. We used different styles of implants for each group. To measure the outcome, we took note of various factors related to the soft tissues in the mouth at different times.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe success of first group was 80%, which was slightly less than the 90% success rate of the second group. However, when we compared the two, we found that the difference wasn't statistically significant. We also found no significant difference in most measurements of the soft tissues between the two groups over time. However, one measurement did increase significantly more in the second group compared to the first.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that flapless implant surgery, whether we start using the implants right away or after a delay, can help improve the appearance of the mouth.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "AIMS AND OBJECTIVES.", "start": 0, "end": 20, "facts": []},

with fibromyalgia use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Properly designed controlled trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of these practices. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early phase trial. Fifty patients seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program were randomly assigned to a daily soy or placebo (casein) shake. Outcome measures were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. Analysis was with standard statistics based on the null hypothesis, and separation test for early phase CAM comparative trials. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. Use of standard statistics with intent-to-treat analysis showed that total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group (P = .02) and by 18% in the placebo group (P < .001). The difference in change in scores between the groups was not significant (P = .16). With the same analysis, CES-D scores decreased in the soy group by 16% (P = .004) and in the placebo group by 15% (P = .05). The change in scores was similar in the groups (P = .83). Results of statistical analysis using the separation test and intent-to-treat analysis revealed no benefit of soy compared with placebo. Shakes that contain soy and shakes that contain casein, when combined with a multidisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment program, provide a decrease in fibromyalgia symptoms. Separation between the effects of soy and casein (control) shakes did not favor the intervention. Therefore, large-sample studies using soy for patients with fibromyalgia are probably not indicated.", "simplification": "This study looked at whether using soy products could help people with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body, to feel better. The researchers randomly divided 50 people with fibromyalgia into two groups. One group drank a soy shake every day, and the other group drank a placebo shake (containing casein, a protein found in milk) that didn't contain any soy. They compared how the two groups were doing both before the study started and after six weeks of drinking the shakes.\n\nThe main result was that both groups felt somewhat better after six weeks, but there was no real difference between the people who drank the soy shakes and those who drank the placebo shakes. The researchers concluded that, based on these results, there's probably no point in doing bigger studies to see whether soy is useful for people with fibromyalgia, because it didn't seem to make a

The patients were split into two groups. Before the surgery started, the ketamine group were given a measured dose of ketamine through an IV drip, while the control group were given a saltwater injection. We checked the levels of pain they felt right after waking up from the operation, and then at 4, 12 and 24 hours after the surgery. We used a 10-point scale to measure the pain intensity.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe enrolled 80 people into the study, with 40 in both groups. At all the pain measurement times, the group that got ketamine felt less pain than the control group. The time before the first request for pain relief was slightly longer in the ketamine group than in the control group. And fewer people in the ketamine group needed strong pain relief injections in the first 24 hours after surgery.

Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 \u00b1 2, 50 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.\n\nRESULTS.\nBIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nGetting the right level of anesthesia for a surgery is very important. For children, the most common method is to have them breathe in the anesthetic. A tube may need to be put down the throat once the child is deeply asleep. It can be hard to tell exactly how deep the sleep is. One way to measure this is using something called a Bispectral index (BIS). In this study, we wanted to see how well the BIS can tell us when a child is asleep enough for the tube to be safely put in.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a test with ninety children who were aged 1 to 6 years and were about to have surgery. We started to monitor their BIS and separated them randomly into three groups. The anesthesia was started by gradually increasing the amount of anesthetic in a mix of oxygen and nitrous oxide. We kept increasing until the BIS reached certain target levels. After the tube was put in, we noted how long the process took, whether there were any complications like trouble breathing, if the child moved, and how long they stayed asleep. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe BIS didn't help us to know the best level of anesthesia for putting the tube in. There was no difference in how long it took, whether there were any problems, or how long the children stayed asleep between the three groups. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results showed that there wasn't a significant difference in problems related to putting in the tube at different BIS levels. To make sure the level of anesthesia is deep enough, we might need to aim for lower BIS values.\n", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence":

One group was given the new medicine and the other was given a placebo (a treatment with no active ingredient). The patients went through a series of tests before and after the study to measure the effects of the medicine.\n\nWHAT THE STUDY FOUND:\nThe study found some evidence that the new medicine had a positive effect on the patients' foot ulcers. There were noticeable changes in the motor Ulnar nerve, which is one of the nerves in the arm that can be affected by diabetes.\n\nTHE STUDY'S CONCLUSIONS:\nThe study concluded that while the medicine

Salbutamol 100 \u03bcg/actuation via pMDI was permitted as reliever medication. The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to treatment period in FEV1 60-min post-dose.\n\nRESULTS.\n613 patients received treatment (formoterol 4.5 \u03bcg n = 206; 9 \u03bcg n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) male; 324 (52.9%) Japanese and 289 (47.1%) European.

The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. \n\nRESULTS.\n613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo.

The primary endpoint of the study, the mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens, a surrogate for marrow quality, was determined by a pathologist in a blinded manner. The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens was significantly longer (56%) for the OBM group (15.3 mm) than for the standard bone marrow (SBM) group (9.8 mm), P<0.003. An objectively determined secondary endpoint; mean procedure time, skin-to-skin; also favored the OBM group (175 s) versus the SBM group (292 s), P<0.007.

It was concluded that bone marrow procedures (BMPs) performed by hematologists-in-training were significantly faster and superior in quality when performed with the OBM compared to the SBM.

The ones taken out by the OnControl device were, on average, over half as long again as the ones taken out with the regular needle.\n\nThe researchers also timed the procedures and found that the OnControl device completed its tests significantly faster than the regular needle did. Other measures also favored the OnControl device. There were only a few minor problems in both groups of tests.\n\nTherefore, the researchers concluded that bone marrow tests carried out by doctors-in-training are faster and provide better results when the OnControl device is used compared to the regular needle. Consequently, this device could be favored as a new norm for adult patients needing hematology, and it is a better tool for teaching medical trainees in hematology.", "original_sentences":

isomaltulose or sucrose for 12 weeks as part of their habitual diet under free-living conditions. HbA1c at 12 weeks was the primary outcome parameter.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn the final analysis comprising 101 patients, isomaltulose did not significantly affect HbA1c at 12 weeks (sucrose: 7.39 \u00b1 0.78%; isomaltulose: 7.24 \u00b1 0.76%; regression coefficient [b]: 0.02 [95% CI: \u22120.21 to 0.25], P = 0.844).

They did this as part of their regular diet. We looked at their HbA1c levels (a measure of blood sugar) at the end of the 12 weeks.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\nOut of 101 people we could finally analyze, replacing regular sugar with isomaltulose didn't make a difference to their HbA1c levels at 12 weeks.

Platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry, without and with stimulation by the thromboxane analog U46619 or ADP.

The standardized meal enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression by 23% after placebo; this response was more than doubled after premeal insulin. U46619-induced fibrinogen binding was unchanged after meal intake with placebo but was markedly enhanced (by \u223c50\u201360%) after premeal insulin.

After meals, blood glucose levels can become unusually high, which can lead to platelet activation. \n\nThis study sought to understand whether administering insulin before a meal could reduce or prevent this platelet activation effect. The experiment included 18 patients with type 2 diabetes and used a reliable trial method where the order of insulin and placebo treatments were randomly assigned and then swapped. \n\nThe process used a technology called flow cytometry to measure platelet activation, which was evaluated before and after the pre-meal blood glucose standardization (if needed, insulin was infused to bring blood glucose levels to a standard range) and 90 minutes after eating. \n\nThe study discovered that giving insulin before a meal reduced post-meal high blood sugar levels significantly compared to the placebo. However, the use of pre-meal insulin also intensified platelet activation after the meal. This reaction was associated with higher insulin levels and lower blood glucose levels. \n\nIn conclusion, the study suggests that post-meal insulin spikes, rather than high blood glucose levels, may be responsible for increased platelet activation in people with type 2 diabetes.

This prospective, randomized, blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid (hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution (Hartmann's Solution).\n\nMETHODS.\n120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid (N = 60) or crystalloid (N = 60) intra-operatively. The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting. Patients were interviewed to assess nausea, vomiting, anti-emetic use, dizziness, sore throat, headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2, 24 and 48 hours post operatively. Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup.\n\nRESULTS.\nAt 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea (38.2 % vs 17.9%, P = 0.03) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively (1.49 \u00b1 0.3 vs 0.68 \u00b1 0.2, P = 0.028). The incidence of vomiting and anti-emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups. Sore throat, dizziness, headache and general well being were not different between the groups.

The fluids we used were known as colloid and crystalloid, and we administered them via an IV drip during a specific type of gynecologic surgery called laparoscopy.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe randomly divided 120 patients to either receive the colloid or crystalloid fluid during their surgery. The amount of fluid we gave was based on the patient's weight and how many hours they had gone without food. After surgery, we checked up on the patients four times (30 minutes, 2 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery) to ask them about their symptoms. In a smaller set of patients, we also tested how well their lungs were working.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that two hours after surgery, more patients that had received the colloid fluid felt nauseous (38.2% vs 17.9%) and their nausea was also worse than those who had received the crystalloid fluid. Vomiting and use of anti-nausea medication were low in both groups. We didn't see any differences when comparing symptoms like sore throat, dizziness, headache or general well-being. Both kinds of fluid caused similar reductions in lung function.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOverall, we found that the use of colloid fluid during surgery increased post-surgery nausea and didn't have any

Transient rises in extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have important signaling roles; and acting through purinergic receptors, can increase blood flow and oxygenation of tissues; and act as neurotransmitters. Increased blood flow not only increases substrate availability but may also aid in recovery through removal of metabolic waste products allowing muscles to accomplish more work with less fatigue. The objective of the present study was to determine if supplemental ATP would improve muscle torque, power, work, or fatigue during repeated bouts of high intensity resistance exercise.\n\nMETHODS.\nSixteen participants (8 male and 8 female; ages: 21\u201334 years) were enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study using a crossover design. The participants received either supplemental ATP (400 mg/d divided into 2 daily doses) or placebo for 15 d. After an overnight fast, participants underwent strength and fatigue testing, consisting of 3 sets of 50 maximal knee extensions performed on a Biodex\u00ae leg dynamometer.\n\nRESULTS.\nNo differences were detected in high peak torque, power, or total work with ATP supplementation; however, low peak torque in set 2 was significantly improved (p < 0.01). Additionally, in set 3, a trend was detected for less torque fatigue with ATP supplementation (p < 0.10).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nSupplementation with 400 mg ATP/d for 15 days tended to reduce muscle fatigue and improved a participant\u2019s ability to maintain a higher force output at the end of an exhaustive exercise bout.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThe body has a compound called adenosine-5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP), which is mostly found inside our cells and plays a significant role in energy supply. Brief increases in this compound level outside the cells can be useful as it helps improve blood flow and oxygen supply to tissues. It can also act as a neurotransmitter to help nerves communicate with each other. Better blood flow can assist in our body's recovery after activity by removing waste products from metabolism. It may also empower muscles to do more work without tiring. This study aims to determine if taking extra ATP can enhance muscle power and reduce fatigue during intense workouts.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe included sixteen people (8 men and 8 women; aged between 21-34 years) in a tightly controlled study that neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was getting the ATP supplements or a placebo. The participants were given either ATP supplements (400mg/day divided into two daily doses) or placebo for 15 days. After fasting overnight, the participants were made to do strength and fatigue tests, involving three sets of 50 maximum knee extensions executed on a machine called a Biodex\u00ae leg dynamometer.\n\nRESULTS.\nATP supplementation didn't make any difference in high peak power or total work. But, it did show significant improvement in low peak power in the second set. There was also a notable trend pointing towards less fatigue with ATP supplementation in the third set.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTaking 400 mg of ATP supplements every day for 15 days seemed to decrease muscle fatigue and improved a participant's capacity to maintain a higher force towards the end of an exhaustive exercise.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Intracellular concentrations of adenosine-5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP) are many times greater than extracellular concentrations (1\u201310 mM versus 10\u2013100 nM, respectively) and cellular release of ATP is tightly controlled.", "start": 12, "end": 224, "facts": [{"fact": "Intracellular concentrations of adenosine-5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP) are greater than extracellular concentrations.", "label": 0, "proba": [0.9381794929504395, 0.0307001955807209, 0.03112025558948517]}, {"fact": "Intracellular concentrations of ATP are 1\u201310 mM.", "label": 0, "proba": [0.6266836524009705, 0.3507961630821228, 0.02252020873129368]}, {"fact": "Extracellular concentrations of ATP are 10\u2013100 nM.", "label": 0, "proba": [0.6206066608428955, 0.36041390895843506, 0.018979445099830627]}, {"fact": "The release of ATP from cells is tightly controlled.", "label": 1, "proba": [0.3229404091835022, 0.6529143452644348, 0.024145323783159256]}]}, {"sentence": "Transient rises in extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have important signaling roles;

Group M received morphine plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, Group T received triamcinolone plus bupivacaine intra-articularly, and Group C received saline plus bupivacaine intra-articularly. Patients were evaluated before injection and in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th weeks after injection. First-line supplementary analgesic was oral paracetamol 1500 mg/day. If analgesia was insufficient with paracetamol, oral dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/day was recommended to patients.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the intra-articular injection, there was statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale (VAS) scores in Groups M and T, when compared to Group C. The decrease of VAS scores seen at the first 2 weeks continued steadily up to the end of 12th week. There was a significant decrease in Groups M and T in the WOMAC scores, when compared to Group C. There was no significant difference in the WOMAC scores between morphine and steroid groups. Significantly less supplementary analgesics was used in the morphine and steroid groups.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIntra-articular morphine was as effective as intra-articular triamcinolone for analgesia in patients with osteoarthritis knee.

We divided them into three groups. One group received a knee injection of morphine and bupivacaine, another group received a knee injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine, and the third group received a knee injection of just saltwater (saline) and bupivacaine. We checked on these patients before they received the injection, and then at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the injection. We gave them paracetamol tablets each day for extra pain relief if needed. If paracetamol didn't help enough, we recommended they take dexketoprofen trometamol tablets.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that after getting the knee injection, both the morphine group and the triamcinolone group had their pain decrease significantly compared to the group that got just the saltwater injection. This pain decrease was seen in the first 2 weeks and remained steady an entire 3 months (12 weeks) after. Based on a pain and physical function test (WOMAC test), both the morphine and the triamcinolone group decreased more than the saltwater group. However, there was no major difference between the morphine group and the triamcinolone group. The morphine and triamcinolone groups used fewer extra pain relief tablets compared to the saltwater group.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nTreatments with knee injections of either morphine or triamcinolone can help patients with knee osteoarthritis manage their pain.

Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental health problems.\n\nMETHODS.\nAn economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score \u2265 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were eligible. Outcome measures were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ-5D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were \u20ac4795 in the PST group and \u20ac6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95% CI -4698;359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nPST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNederlands Trial Register ISRCTN51021015", "simplification": "BACKGROUND\nMany people struggle with mental health issues, which can lead to other health problems and higher healthcare costs. We wanted to know if having nurses help these patients work through their problems (a method called Problem-Solving Treatment or PST) in the normal setting of a primary care doctor's office could be a useful and cost-effective way to manage mental health more efficiently. \n\nMETHODS\nWe did a study, alongside a clinical trial, tracking costs and outcomes in two groups of patients who were known to have mental health problems (based on a standard questionnaire called the General Health Questionnaire) and had visited their family doctor at least three times in the past 6 months. One group was treated by their regular doctors in the normal way. The other was also treated by nurses using Problem-Solving Treatment. \n\nRESULTS\nNine months later, there was no major difference in mental health outcomes in the two groups. But the costs were lower for the group receiving nurse-led PST. Despite some statistical variations in the data, further analysis still showed that this method of managing mental health by nurses was cost-effective.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that using nurses to deliver this type of problem-solving treatment can be a cost-effective way of taking care of patients with mental health problems. However, the cost difference was heavily influenced by a few patients who had unusually high costs in the regular doctor's care group, so we must be cautious in generalizing these results.\n\nTRIAL

is one of the commonest obstetric interventions, with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery. Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nMETHODS.\nWomen with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nRESULTS.\nOPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nSometimes, doctors need to induce labor in pregnant women, which means they have to artificially start the labor process. This is a common procedure that affects both the woman and the health care system. One way to reduce the impact, is to carry out the procedure in an outpatient setting, meaning the patient can go home after the procedure instead of staying at the hospital. There's not much information on how outpatient and inpatient inductions compare, and also some safety worries if outpatient inductions use a certain medication used in inpatient settings. This study is aiming to see if it's feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients to induce labor in an outpatient setting using a Foley catheter, compared to inpatient inductions using vaginal PGE2.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn the study, 101 women who needed labor induced were split into two groups. 50 women were in the outpatient group and used a Foley catheter for induction. These women were able to go home overnight after a reassuring test. The other 51 women were in the inpatient group and used vaginal PGE2 for induction. The main things checked were how long the hospital stay was, how the baby was born, how long it took from induction to delivery, any side effects, and how satisfied the patients were.\n\nRESULTS.\nWomen in the outpatient group spent less time in the hospital before giving birth, but those in the inpatient group were more likely to have a vaginal birth within 12 hours of going to the Birthing Unit. Overall vaginal birth rates, the time from induction to delivery, and total time spent in the hospital were almost the same for both groups. However, the outpatient group felt less pain and had better sleep but were more likely need additional labor induction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient labor induction was feasible and acceptable for women who are not in a good condition to give birth naturally, however, it did not show a significant reduction in total time spent in the hospital and was associated with increased need for labor induction.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis study has been reported to the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11,

A total of 80 elderly patients requiring general anesthesia were recruited. They were divided into four groups (each n=20) according to different target concentrations of remifentanil and sufentanil. These target concentrations were: 4 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for group I; 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.3 ng/ml sufentanil for group II; 2 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.5 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group III; and 5 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 4 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group IV. Norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in plasma were measured prior to the induction of anesthesia, as well as at several different time-points following surgery. The numbers of intraoperative severe hemodynamic fluctuation, postoperative eye-opening and extubation time, and post-extubation restlessness and pain scores were recorded. Group IV had a larger circulation fluctuation control number and higher levels of NE, E and Ang II at 3 h after surgery than any other group (P<0.01). Although group IV had shorter postoperative eye-opening and extubation times compared with the other groups (P<0.05), it also had higher restlessness and pain scores (P<0.01).

Eighty older patients who needed general anesthesia were selected and grouped into fours based on different levels of remifentanil and sufentanil used. Blood samples were taken before and after surgery at different times to measure certain hormone levels related to stress. We also observed and recorded various factors such as changes in blood flow during surgery, time taken for patients to open their eyes and to remove the breathing tube post surgery, as well as their levels of restlessness and pain after the breathing tube was removed. \n\nThe group that used only remifentanil had higher blood flow changes and stress hormone levels three hours post surgery compared to the other groups. Even though patients in this group woke up and had their breathing tubes removed sooner after surgery, they also reported higher levels of restlessness and pain. The conclusion is that using sufentanil and remifentanil together stabilizes blood flow during surgery and lowers stress hormone levels.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "The current study aimed

trial with systematic random sampling; all were aged 55 and older, from Torremolinos, Spain. Participants either received (n = 50) the PAPP for 60 minutes, twice a week during three months or (n = 50) they received health education. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured by general state of health the Short Form 12 health survey questionnaire, and the quality of life was determined with the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire. Cardiopulmonary function was measured with a spirometry and a walking test according to the Bruce protocol.\n\nRESULTS.\nThis pilot study had a significant impact on the quality of life (p = 0.05) in men, which increased. However, the quality of life in women did not improve. The average changes in the lung and cardiovascular function was not significant between groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nChanges in the quality of life measured with EQ-5D in the group of men who carried out the PAPP were statistically significant when comparing between groups.

Half of them did the PAPP for an hour twice a week for three months, the rest were given health education. We used questionnaires and health tests to measure how well their hearts and lungs were working, and how much their quality of life improved.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall, the program improved the quality of life in men, but not women. There wasn't a notable change in the heart and lung function for either group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe PAPP program was found to help improve quality of life for men but didn't show significant improvements in heart and lung function for anyone.

the efficacy of alfuzosin for the treatment of ureteral calculi less than 10 mm in diameter after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nA randomized, single-blind clinical trial was performed prospectively by one physician between June 2010 and August 2011. A total of 84 patients with ureteral calculi 5 to 10 mm in diameter were divided into two groups. Alfuzosin 10 mg (once daily) and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) were prescribed to group 1 (n=41), and loxoprofen sodium 68.1 mg (as needed) only was prescribed to group 2 (n=44). The drug administration began immediately after ESWL and continued until stone expulsion was confirmed up to a maximum of 42 days after the procedure.\n\nRESULTS.\nThirty-nine of 41 (95.1%) patients in group 1 and 40 of 43 (93.0%) patients in group 2 ultimately passed stones (p=0.96). The number of ESWL sessions was 1.34\u00b10.65 and 1.41\u00b10.85 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.33). The patients who required analgesics after ESWL were 8 (19.5%) in group 1 and 13 (30.2%) in group 2 (p=0.31). Visual analogue scale pain severity scores were 5.33\u00b11.22 and 6.43\u00b11.36 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.056). The time to stone expulsion in groups 1 and 2 was 9.5\u00b14.8 days and 14.7\u00b19.8 days, respectively (p=0.005). No significant adverse effects occurred.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of alfuzosin in combination with ESWL seems to facilitate stone passage and to reduce the time of stone expulsion but does not affect the stone-free rate.", "simplification": "PURPOSE:\nWe studied whether the drug alfuzosin can help treat kidney stones that are less than 10 mm in size after a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe did a controlled, single-blind medical trial from June 2010 to August 2011. During this trial, 84 people with kidney stones that are 5 to 10 mm in size were randomly split into two groups. The first group was given alfuzosin and another drug called loxoprofen sodium. The second group only received loxoprofen sodium. The patients were given these drugs immediately after their ESWL procedure and treatment was continued until their kidney stones passed or up to six weeks after the procedure.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nIn the first group, 39 out of 41 patients (95.1%) passed their kidney stones, while in the second group, 40 out of 43 patients (93.0%) passed their stones. There wasn't a significant difference in the number of treatment sessions each group needed or in the number of patients that needed painkillers following treatment. However, the first group that received alfuzosin reported slightly less pain and passed their kidney stones about 5 days faster than the second group. We didn't notice any big negative side effects of the treatment. \n\nWHAT THIS MEANS:\nThis research suggests that using alfuzosin along with ESWL can make kidney stones pass quicker. However, it doesn't seem to affect the overall success rate, i.e., the chance of the kidney stone being completely removed.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "PURPOSE.", "start": 0, "end": 8,

They were placed randomly into two groups. One group used the portion-controlled diet as part of a nine-session lifestyle program, while the other group had a nine-session program focused on teaching them to manage Type-2 diabetes. Both groups had the same goals for daily calorie intake (1250-1550 calories) and weekly exercise (200 minutes).\n\nRESULTS\nOn the whole, both groups improved in weight and blood sugar levels after 6 months. However, those on the portion-controlled diet lost an average of 7.3 kilos compared to 2.2 kilos in the diabetes management group. More people in the portion-controlled diet group lost at least 5% of their starting weight and 10% of their starting weight. Blood sugar levels also decreased more in the portion-controlled group compared to the diabetes management group. Across both groups, the more weight lost, the better the decrease in blood sugar levels.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings show that ready-to-eat, portion-controlled meals can significantly improve weight and blood sugar control in overweight people with Type 2 diabetes.

antihyperalgesic effects in animal pain models using topical capsaicin with activation of TRPV1-receptor positive nociceptive neurons. Clinical benefit from CO2 inhalation in patients with craniofacial pain caused by a putative activation of TRPV1 receptor positive trigeminal neurons has also been reported. These effects are probably mediated via an activation of TRPV1 receptor - positive neurons in the nasal mucosa with subsequent central inhibitory effects (such as conditioned pain modulation). In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of intranasal CO2 on a human model of craniofacial pain elicited by nasal application of capsaicin.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a first experiment, 48 healthy volunteers without previous craniofacial pain received intranasal capsaicin to provoke trigeminal pain elicited by activation of TRVP1 positive nociceptive neurons. Then, CO2 or air was insufflated alternatingly into the nasal cavity at a flow rate of 1 l/min for 60 sec each. In the subsequent experiment, all participants were randomized into 2 groups of 24 each and received either continuous nasal insufflation of CO2 or placebo for 18:40 min after nociceptive stimulation with intranasal capsaicin. In both experiments, pain was rated on a numerical rating scale every 60 sec.\n\nRESULTS.\nContrary to previous animal studies, the effects of CO2 on experimental trigeminal pain were only marginal. In the first experiment, CO2 reduced pain ratings only minimally by 5.3% compared to air if given alternatingly with significant results for the main factor GROUP (F1,47\u2009=\u20094.438; p\u2009=\u20090.041) and the interaction term TIME*GROUP (F2.6,121.2\u2009=\u20093.3; p\u2009=\u20090.029) in the repeated-measures ANOVA. However, these effects were abrogated after continuous insufflation of CO2 or placebo with no significant changes for the main factors or the interaction term.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAlthough mild modulatory effects of low-flow intranasal CO2 could be seen in this human model of TRPV-1 mediated activation of nociceptive trigeminal neurons, utility is limited as observed changes in pain ratings are clinically non-significant.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND:\nResearch has shown that putting CO2 in the nose can help reduce pain in animals, probably by activating a specific type of neuron (nerve cells). Some evidence suggests that inhaling CO2 might also help people with facial pain. This is thought to work by activating the same kind of neurons in the nose, leading to effects that can help control pain. This study aims to see how CO2 in the nose affects facial pain caused by capsaicin, a substance that causes a burning sensation.\n\nMETHODS:\nIn this experiment, 48 healthy volunteers who never had facial pain before were made to feel a type of facial pain through the nasal application of capsaicin. They then had either CO2 or air alternately puffed into their nostrils for 60 seconds each. After that, they were split into two groups, where one group continuously received CO2 in the nose while the other received a placebo. They were asked to rate their level of pain every minute. \n\nRESULTS:\nThe results weren't as promising as the previous animal studies. The CO2 only slightly reduced the pain by about 5.3% compared to air and these effects were not seen after continuous implementation of CO2 or the placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough a small reduction in pain was observed in this study where CO2 was administered to activate a specific type of neuron, the results were not significant enough to make a real difference in the clinical treatment of facial pain.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Nasal insufflation of CO2 has been shown to exert antinociceptive respectively

inactivated influenza vaccine at 2 different doses (0.50\u00a0mL vs 0.25\u00a0mL) was evaluated in children aged 6\u201335 months. The study was randomized, observer blind, multicenter, and stratified by age (6\u201323 months and 24\u201335 months), and it accounted for prior influenza immunization status.\n\nRESULTS.\nThree hundred seventy-four children were in the total vaccinated cohort (study vaccine 0.25-mL dose, n\u00a0=\u00a0164; 0.50-mL dose, n\u00a0=\u00a0167; comparator 0.25\u00a0mL, n\u00a0=\u00a043). Regulatory criteria for immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in adults were met for all virus strains and doses for both age strata. A modest but not statistically significant improvement in immune responses was observed with the higher dose and reactogenicity, and safety of the 2 doses was not significantly different.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe 0.5-mL dose of the study vaccine, when administered to children aged 6\u201335 months, resulted in a modest but not statistically significant improvement in immunogenicity with clinically similar safety and reactogenicity compared with the 0.25-mL dose.

Our study was designed and conducted carefully, with the researcher not knowing who received what amount of the vaccine. We also considered what flu shots the children had had before.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe tested the vaccine on 374 children. The effectiveness (how well it boosts the immune system) of the vaccine for all three virus strains in the vaccine met the standards set for adults, and it didn't matter how much of the vaccine the kids got or how old they were. We found a small improvement in the immune response with the larger dose, but the difference wasn't significant. The two different doses had similar safety levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nGiving kids aged 6-35 months the larger dose (0.5ml) of this flu vaccine made a small improvement, but it wasn't a significant difference. Importantly, it was equally safe and well-tolerated as the smaller dose (0.25ml).

polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Oral supply of these fatty acids increases their levels in plasma and cell membranes, often at the expense of the omega-6 PUFAs arachidonic acid (ARA) and linoleic acid. This results in an altered pattern of lipid mediator production to one which is less pro-inflammatory. We investigated whether short term intravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs could change the levels of EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid in plasma and erythrocytes in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwenty patients were randomised to receive a 72 hour infusion of total parenteral nutrition with (treatment group) or without (control group) omega-3 PUFAs. EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid were measured in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) and erythrocytes at several times points up to the end of infusion and 5 to 12 days (mean 9 days) after stopping the infusion.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe treatment group showed increases in plasma PC EPA and DHA and erythrocyte EPA and decreases in plasma PC and erythrocyte linoleic acid, with effects most evident late in the infusion period. Plasma PC and erythrocyte EPA and linoleic acid all returned to baseline levels after the 5\u201312 day washout. Plasma PC DHA remained elevated above baseline after washout.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIntravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs results in a rapid increase of EPA and DHA in plasma PC and of EPA in erythrocytes.

In this prospective, randomized, double blinded, and parallel group and open label study of 90 adult patients aged 18\u201360 years, of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II, scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery, were randomly allocated in two groups.

We found that use of midazolam as adjuvant with the local anesthetic in spinal anaesthesia significantly increases the duration of analgesia (median 320 min versus 220 min) and motor block (median 255 min versus 195 min) but decreases the incidence of postoperative nausea-vomiting (PONV).", "simplification": "Spinal anesthesia is often used during surgeries below the belly button, like a C-section or a hernia operation.

In this study, we wanted to see what effect the drug midazolam would have if used along with the anesthetic in these lower body surgeries.\n\nThe study involved 90 adult patients, aged 18 to 60, who were already scheduled for such a surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group was given the normal anesthetic along with a saline solution. The second group received the same anesthetic, but with midazolam added.\n\nOur findings showed that adding midazolam to the anesthetic used in spinal anesthesia made the pain relief last longer (on average, 320 minutes compared to 220 minutes) and also made the numbness last longer (averaging 255 minutes versus 195 minutes).

These studies represent all randomized, double-blind trials conducted by Merck that included patients treated with the usual clinical dose of sitagliptin (100\u00a0mg/day) for between 12\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0years, and for which results were available as of December 2011. These studies assessed sitagliptin, versus comparator agents, taken as monotherapy, initial combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, or as add-on combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic agents (metformin, pioglitazone, a sulfonylurea\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0metformin, insulin\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0metformin, or metformin\u00a0+\u00a0pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). Patient-level data from each study were used to evaluate between-group differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (AEs).\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall incidence rates of AEs and drug-related AEs were higher in the non-exposed group compared with the sitagliptin group. Incidence rates of specific AEs were generally similar between the two groups, except for higher incidence rates of hypoglycemia related to the greater use of a sulfonylurea and diarrhea related to the greater use of metformin in the non-exposed group, and of constipation in the sitagliptin group. Treatment with sitagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancy, or pancreatitis.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn this updated pooled safety analysis of data from 14,611 patients with T2DM, sitagliptin 100\u00a0mg/day was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 2\u00a0years in duration.", "simplification": "INTRODUCTION.\nAn earlier analysis of 19 studies researched by Merck, including data up to July 2009 from 10,246 patients with type 2 diabetes, revealed that sitagliptin (a diabetes medication) was generally safe and well-accepted by patients when compared to other similar treatments. As research on sitagliptin continues, new studies have been completed which add more data to our understanding of how safe and easy to tolerate this drug is. This analysis looks at the updated safety data obtained from 25 studies. \n\nMETHODS.\nThe analysis included data from 14,611 patients in 25 studies. In these studies, patients were divided into two groups: one group that received sitagliptin (7,726 patients) and another group that received a different treatment (6,885 patients). Every study included were controlled experiments done by Merck that used the usual dose of sitagliptin (100mg/day), with treatment length ranging from 12 weeks to 2 years. The studies used in this analysis were available up to December 2011. The studies tested sitagliptin used on its own or in combination with other diabetes drugs like metformin or pioglitazone. By observing each patient's data, researchers were able to compare the rate of side effects between the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe analysis found that overall, the group not treated with sitagliptin had a higher rate of side effects and side effects that were related to their medicines compared to the group that was treated with sitagliptin. However, the rate of specific side effects was generally the same for both groups, except for low blood sugar caused by a different drug (sulfonylurea), diarrhea caused by metformin in the non-sitagliptin group and constipation in the sitagliptin group. It was found that sitagliptin did not increase the risk of serious heart issues, cancer, or inflammation of the pancreas.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn this updated analysis reviewing the safety data of 14,611 patients with type 2 diabetes, it was revealed that sitagliptin, when given at a dose of 100mg/day was generally safe to use and well-tolerated by patients in clinical trials that lasted up to 2

post-injection cytokine surge. We hypothesized that vitamin D3 supplementation would ameliorate FLS by decreasing related serum cytokines\u2019 levels.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a randomized, double blind study of 45 IFN\u03b2-treated PwMS, 21 patients were assigned to 800\u00a0IU of vitamin D3 per day (low dose), while 24 patients received 4,370\u00a0IU per day (high dose) for one year. FLS were assessed monthly by telephonic interviews. Serum levels of 25-hydroxy-D (25-OH-D), calcium, PTH, IL-17, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 were measured periodically. EDSS, relapses, adverse events and quality of life (QoL) were documented.\n\nRESULTS.\n25-OH-D levels increased to a significantly higher levels and PTH levels decreased in the high dose group. There was no significant change in FLS. IL-17 levels were significantly increased in the low dose group, while patients receiving high dose vitamin D had a heterogeneous IL-17 response. No significant differences in relapse rate, EDSS, QoL, serum IL-10 and IFN\u03b3 were found. Hypercalcemia or other potential major adverse events were not observed.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nVitamin D supplementation to IFN\u2212\u03b2 treated PwMS, at the doses used, seems safe and associated with dose-dependent changes in IL-17 serum levels, while not affecting IFN\u2212\u03b2 related FLS.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01005095", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nPeople with Multiple Sclerosis often get flu-like symptoms when receiving a treatment called interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2). There seems to be a link with a spike in certain proteins (cytokines) in the blood after the injection. We think taking Vitamin D3 might help reduce these flu-like symptoms by lowering the levels of these proteins in the blood.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe ran a study with 45 people who were being treated for their Multiple Sclerosis with IFN-\u03b2. Half of them were given a small dose of Vitamin D3 each day and the other half were given a larger dose, every day for a year. We checked in with them regularly via phone to see if they were having flu-like symptoms. We also checked certain things in their blood and noted any relapses or changes in the quality of their life.\n\nRESULTS.\nPeople who took the higher dose of Vitamin D3 had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood and lower levels of a certain hormone. However, we didn't see any major change in their flu-like symptoms. In the low dose group, levels of a certain protein (IL-17) rose significantly. No major changes were found in other factors we were monitoring, such as relapse rate and quality of life. We also didn't observe any serious side effects from the vitamin D supplementation.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIt seems safe for people receiving IFN-\u03b2 treatment for their Multiple Sclerosis to take Vitamin D supplements. The dose does measurably impact levels of the protein IL-17, but it doesn't seem to affect the flu-like symptoms related to the IFN-\u03b2 treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis clinical trial is

children with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) is traditionally managed with exercise, however the supporting evidence for this is scarce. No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed affects outcomes.\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment. Assessors were blinded to the participants\u2019 treatment allocation and participants blinded to the difference in the treatments.\n\nRESULTS.\nChildren with JHS and knee pain (n=26) aged 7-16 years were randomly assigned to the hypermobile (n=12) or neutral (n=14) treatment group. Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 \u2013 23.8 mm, p=0.003). Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only to neutral (p=0.037). No other differences were found between groups and no adverse events occurred.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParents perceive improved child psychosocial health when children exercise into the hypermobile range, while exercising to neutral only is perceived to favour the child\u2019s physical health. A physiotherapist prescribed, supervised, individualised and progressed exercise programme effectively reduces knee pain in children with JHS.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralia & New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ACTRN12606000109505.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nHypermobile joints (joints that can move beyond normal limits) can cause knee pain in children.

This study had two goals: to see if a knee-strength exercise program, designed by a physiotherapist, can reduce knee pain compared to doing nothing, and to check if the specific way exercises are performed influences how they work.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study took place in a major hospital in Sydney, Australia, and involved a group of children who were put into two separate exercise programs for eight weeks. One group did exercises into their hypermobile range, and the other group did exercises following their normal movement range. The study period started after at least two weeks of no treatment. The kids were put into groups randomly by a computer program. The main measure was how much knee pain the child reported. We also measured quality of life, leg strength, and function in three stages: before the study, after the initial no treatment period, and after the exercise program ended. The people assessing the results didn't know which group the children were in, and the kids didn't know the differences between the two treatments.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe 26 children participating, aged between 7-16, were split into the hypermobile (12 children) or neutral (14 children) movement groups. Both groups reported that their knee pain lessened significantly after treatment\u2014an average of 14.5 units decrease on the pain scale. In terms of emotional health, parents reported that kids who exercised into the hypermobile range had better self-esteem, emotional health, and behavior. As for physical health, parents thought kids who kept to their normal movement range were better off. There were no other significant differences between the two groups and no bad side effects happened.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIt appears that parents observe improved emotional health in children who exercise in their hypermobile range, while exercising within normal range seems to benefit the child\u2019s physical wellbeing. Therefore, a knee-strength exercise program supervised by a physiotherapist can effectively reduce knee pain for kids having hypermobile joints.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in the

No research to date has evaluated the combined approach in depression. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate both the independent effects of a CBM protocol targeting imagery and interpretation bias (CBM-I) and the combined effects of CBM-I followed by iCBT. Method: Patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode were randomized to an 11-week intervention (1 week/CBM-I + 10 weeks/iCBT; n = 38) that was delivered via the Internet with no face-to-face patient contact or to a wait-list control (WLC; n = 31). Results: Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.62\u20132.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention. Analyses demonstrated that the change in interpretation bias at least partially mediated the reduction in depression symptoms following CBM-I. Treatment superiority over the WLC was also evident on all outcome measures at both time points (Hedges gs = .59\u2013.98). Significant reductions were also observed following the combined intervention on secondary measures associated with depression: disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking (Cohen's d = 1.51\u20132.23).

Until now, no one has tested how well this combination works for treating depression. \n\nMethod: Individuals with severe depression were randomly selected to participate in this 11-week program, which includes a week of computerized exercises and ten weeks of online therapy, done entirely online with no face-to-face meetings. They were compared to another group who were on a wait-list and did not receive any treatment.\n\nResults: The results showed that both the computerized exercises and the combination of these exercises and online therapy significantly reduced depression symptoms and levels of distress. This improvement was moderately to very strong, according to standard measurement tools. The reduction in depression symptoms was at least partly due to the ability of individuals to alter their negative thought patterns, as trained by the computerized exercises. The treatment group performed better than the wait-list group on every outcome measure at both time points. Measures such as disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thoughts also significantly improved following the combined intervention. At the end of the computerized exercises, 27% of patients showed clinically significant improvements, and this percentage increased to 65% after completing the online therapy as well.\n\nConclusion:

"BACKGROUND.\nThe conduct of clinical trials should be an integral part of routine patient care. Treating patients in trials incurs additional costs over and above standard of care (SOC), but the extent of the cost burden is not known. We undertook a retrospective cost attribution analysis to quantitate the treatment costs associated with cancer clinical trial protocols conducted over a 2 year period.\n\nMETHODS.\nAll patients entered into oncology (non-haematology) clinical trials involving investigational medicinal products in 2009 and 2010 in a single UK institution were identified. The trial protocols on which they were treated were analysed to identify the treatment costs for the experimental arm(s) of the trial and the equivalent SOC had the patient not been entered in the trial. The treatment cost difference was calculated by subtracting the experimental treatment cost from SOC cost. For randomised trials, an average treatment cost was estimated by taking into account the number of arms and randomisation ratio. An estimate of the annual treatment costs was calculated.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 357 adult oncology patients were treated on 53 different trial protocols: 40 phase III, 2 randomised II/III and 11 phase II design. A total of 27 trials were academic, non-commercial sponsored trials and 26 were commercial sponsored trials. When compared with SOC, the average treatment cost per patient was an excess of \u00a3431 for a non-commercial trial (range \u00a36393 excess to \u00a36005 saving) and a saving of \u00a39294 for a commercial trial (range \u00a30 to \u00a371 480). There was an overall treatment cost saving of \u00a3388 719 in 2009 and \u00a3496 556 in 2010, largely attributable to pharmaceutical company provision of free drug supplies.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOn an average, non-commercial trial protocols were associated with a small per patient excess treatment cost, whereas commercial trials were associated with a substantially higher cost saving. Taking into account the total number of patients recruited annually, treatment of patients on clinical trial protocols was associated with considerable cost savings across both the non-commercial and commercial portfolio.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND\nClinical trials are part of regular medical care. These trials, though, can cost more than standard treatments. We looked at cancer clinical trials over two years to figure out how much extra they cost.\n\nMETHODS\nWe found and studied all patients who took part in drug-based cancer clinical trials in 2009 and 2010 at one hospital in the UK. We compared the cost of the treatments in the trials and the usual treatments the patients could have received. We figured out the difference in cost between these two. For studies that compared treatments, we estimated the average treatment cost. We also estimated the yearly costs.\n\nRESULTS\nDuring those two years, 357 adult cancer patients took part in 53 different research studies. Some of these were designed by universities and other non-profit groups, while others were sponsored by drug companies. On average, the university trials cost an extra \u00a3431 per patient. The drug company trials, on the other hand, saved an average of \u00a39294 per patient. This is largely because these companies supplied the drugs for free. In total, these trials saved about \u00a3885,275 over the two years.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn general, trials designed by universities cost a little more per patient. Drug company trials, though, saved much more money. Given the large number of patients that take part in these trials every year, they can lead to big savings, regardless of who runs them.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start":

In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45\u201360 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.\n\nRESULTS.\nCleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.  However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND\nThis study checked how deep freezing (vitrification) and other related factors affect the growth and development of immature cow egg cells (also called COCs).\n\nMETHODS\nWe did two experiments. In the first experiment, we had 420 COCs separated into four groups: Group 1 received no treatment. Group 2 was exposed to a special freezing mixture for 5 minutes. Group 3 got the same freeze mix, then a second mix for 45-60 seconds. Group 4 went through the same steps as group 3, but these COCs were also fast-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then warmed up quickly. In the second experiment, we treated 581 COCs the same way but also had some of the COCs from groups 2, 3 and 4 spend either 1 or 5 minutes in a warming solution. All COCs from both experiments were then grown and fertilized in a lab.\n\nRESULTS\nWe noticed that the rate at which the COCs grew and developed was the same for groups 1, 2 and 3, no matter how long they spent in the warming solution. But for the group 4 COCs\u2014the ones that had been fast-frozen and heated up again\u2014their growth and development rates were much lower.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe concluded that the freezing mixes and the time spent in the warming solution did not negatively affect the COCs.

"OBJECTIVE.\nGenetic variants near IRS1 are associated with features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). We examined whether genetic variants near IRS1 might modulate the effects of diets varying in fat content on the MetS status in a 2-year weight-loss trial.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nTwo variants near IRS1, rs1522813 and rs2943641, were genotyped in 738 overweight/obese adults (age 60 \u00b1 9 years; BMI 32.7 \u00b1 3.9 kg/m2) randomly assigned to one of four weight-loss diets (a deficit of 750 kcal/day of caloric intake from baseline) varying in macronutrient contents for 2 years. We compared MetS status of high-fat (40% of caloric intake; n = 370) and low-fat (20% caloric intake; n = 368) diet groups differentiated by genotypes (rs1522813 A-allele carriers and noncarriers and rs2943641T-allele carriers and noncarriers).\n\nRESULTS.\nAmong rs1522813 A-allele carriers, the reversion rates of the MetS were higher in the high-fat diet group than those in the low-fat diet group over the 2-year intervention (P = 0.002), while no significant difference between diet groups was observed among noncarriers (P = 0.27). The genetic modulation on dietary effect was independent of weight changes. The odds ratio (OR) for the 2-year reversion of the MetS was 2.88 (95% CI 1.25\u20136.67) comparing the high-fat and low-fat diets among rs1522813 A-allele carriers, while the corresponding OR was 0.83 (0.36\u20131.92) in noncarriers. The variant rs2943641 was not observed to modulate dietary effects on the MetS status.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur data suggest that high-fat weight-loss diets might be more effective in the management of the MetS compared with low-fat diets among individuals with the A-allele of the rs1522813 variant near IRS1.", "simplification": "OBJECTIVE.\nWe wanted to see if certain genetic differences might impact how diet, specifically levels of fat intake, affects something called Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). MetS is a group of conditions like high blood sugar or blood pressure that together increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. We tested this theory in a 2-year diet experiment.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nWe looked at two genetic differences in 738 overweight or obese adults. These people were randomly put on one of four diets for 2 years. These diets all had a reduction of 750 daily calories but varied in fat content. We then checked the MetS health of people on high-fat diets (40% of daily calorie intake) and low-fat diets (20% of daily calorie intake). We saw how these conditions changed for people with and without these genetic differences.\n\nRESULTS.\nAmong people who carry a specific genetic difference, they were more likely to see a decrease in MetS conditions if they followed a high-fat diet compared to those on a low-fat diet over the 2-year period. However, there was no significant diet difference for people without this genetic difference. The effect of the diet was independent of weight changes. If you carried this genetic difference, you were almost 3 times more likely to see a decrease in MetS when on a high-fat diet compared to a low-fat diet. The second genetic difference we tested did not have a noticeable impact on diet effects on MetS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis suggests that a high-fat diet might be better at managing MetS for people with a specific genetic difference near IRS1, compared to a low-fat diet.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE.", "start": 0, "end": 10, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Genetic variants near IRS1 are

either; 5 mg morphine or 50 mg tramadol intra-articularly. Pain was evaluated by means of the verbal pain rating score (VRS) preoperatively (at rest and on movement of the knee joint) and postoperatively at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Meanwhile, the time of the first analgesic request and need for supplemental analgesic were also recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was no statistically significant difference in VRS scoring between the two groups during the preoperative period either at rest or on knee movement. Meanwhile, VRS scores did not differ significantly between the morphine and tramadol treated groups postoperatively, except for in the one-hour post-operative scores in which the tramadol-treated group experienced less pain (P < 0.007). Post-operative VRS scores at 6, 12, and 24 hours were significantly decreased when compared with previous scores in both morphine and tramadol prescribed subjects (P < 0.001), hence, both local analgesics can significantly reduce pain after minor knee surgery.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nWe have found a postoperative analgesic effect of intra-articularly administered morphine and tramadol following minor arthroscopic knee surgeries with a maximum effect 6 hours post injection.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at how two pain relievers, morphine and tramadol, are used after minor knee surgery.\n\nOBJECTIVES. \nThe goal of the study was to see which painkiller, morphine or tramadol, was better at reducing pain after minor knee surgery. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS. \nThe study involved 132 patients who were getting minor knee surgery. They were randomly chosen to receive either morphine or tramadol. Their pain levels were measured before surgery (when they were at rest and when they moved their knee) and after surgery. This was done at various times after the surgery. At the same time, the study looked at when the patients first asked for more pain relief and if they needed extra painkillers.\n\nRESULTS. \nThere was no big difference in the pain levels of the two groups before the surgery. Even after the surgery, the pain levels in both groups didn't differ too much. An exception was found one hour after the surgery when the patients given tramadol had less pain. The study also found that six hours after using the pain relievers, the pain levels in both groups dropped significantly. \n\nCONCLUSIONS. \nThe study found that both morphine and tramadol reduced

Because of the lack of success of most TBI interventions and the documented benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our study on use of EE in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, EE housing was able to restore the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mTBI.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nBrain injuries often lead to long-lasting inflammation and energy disruptions in brain activities. Despite several medical treatments, their effectiveness has been limited. However, it is known that environment enrichment (EE) - an uplifting environment - can help in boosting brain recovery. This study therefore looked into how EE can help in reducing inflammation and restoring energy balance in the brain after a minor brain injury. We conducted our study on adult male rats, which either had a minor brain injury or a fake surgery. These rats were then placed in either an EE or normal living conditions. After four weeks, we tested their cognitive abilities and measured the levels of inflammatory proteins in their brain. We also checked for levels of certain proteins that regulate brain energy balance.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur findings showed that EE: (1) reduced the inflammation-causing proteins and increased healing proteins following a minor brain injury; (2) lessened the cognitive problems caused by the minor brain injury; and (3) diminished the decline in energy regulating proteins from the minor brain injury.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study suggests that EE can help to control persistent: (1) inflammation in the brain after a minor brain injury, and (2) the ongoing disruption in brain energy balance.

Then, we measured their swimming speed and their oxygen usage during exercise, both pre and post study. We analyzed all data using a specific type of software called SPSS. This study has been officially registered.\n\nRESULTS.\nOn average, the probiotic yogurt group improved their swimming speed slightly more than the regular yogurt group. They also reported less difficulty breathing and ear pain, and had fewer respiratory infections.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nWe observed that eating probiotic yogurt reduced respiratory infections and problems like difficulty with breathing and ear pain.

Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.\n\nMETHODS.\nUnmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.\n\nRESULTS.\nParticipants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood.

One way to boost this activity in the brain is by using a special type of MRI (a brain imaging technique) known as real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf). We wanted to see if people with depression could use this technique to increase their brain's response to positive personal memories, and if this could affect their symptoms.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with people who have depression but are not taking medication. We divided these individuals into two groups: one was shown rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala and the other from a different brain area (as a comparison). These individuals were asked to think about happy personal memories to increase the level of a certain signal in the targeted brain area. They did this activity for 40 seconds, followed by rest and counting backwards. Lastly, they did another brain scan without feedback information.\n\nRESULTS:\nPeople in the first group were able to increase their amygdala's response when remembering positive personal memories. Compared to the second group, these individuals also showed a significant decrease in anxiety and an increase in happiness after scanning. When they were not given feedback, their brain activity in certain areas was increased compared to the control group.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur research suggests that people with depression were able to control their brain's response to happy memories using this special type of MRI known as rtfMRI-nf. This resulted in an improved mood. These findings provide preliminary evidence that such brain training using positive memory recall could potentially be a new way to treat depression.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence":

changes. The purpose of this study is to characterize, in vivo, carotid arterial structural and functional changes by applying radio frequency and X-strain ultrasound techniques.\n\nMETHODS.\nNinety-one subjects were assigned into two groups; a diabetes group and a control group. Structural and functional changes in the common carotid arterial wall were investigated by quality intima-media thickness (QIMT), quality arterial stiffness (QAS), and X-strain analysis with a Mylab Twice ultrasound instrument. The relationships among variables between the two groups were analyzed in this study.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was no significant difference in carotid IMT (626.5 \u00b1 169.1 \u03bcm vs. 568.5 \u00b1 122.6 \u03bcm, P = 0.1506) between two groups. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and stiffness index (\u03b2) were remarkably greater (8.388 \u00b1 3.254 m/s vs. 7.269 \u00b1 1.332 m/s; 12.51 \u00b1 14.16 vs.9.279 \u00b1 2.871), while compliance coefficient (CC) decreased significantly in the diabetes group (0.802 \u00b1 0.3094 mm2/Kpa vs. 0.968 \u00b1 0.3992 mm2/Kpa) (P < 0.05). The displacement difference of radial (RD-D), longitudinal (LD-D) and rotation (ROT-D) directions were significantly different between two groups' comparison (P = 0.0212, P = 0.0235 and P = 0.0072, respectively). The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) and the time of radial peak strain rate (RSR-T) were found to be significantly different between the two groups (341.9 \u00b1 77.56 ms vs. 369.0 \u00b1 78.26 ms, P = 0.0494; 142.7 \u00b1 22.43 ms vs. 136.2 \u00b1 30.70 ms, P = 0.0474). CS-TD and RSR-T were also found to be positively correlated with CC value (r = 0.3908, P < 0.005 and r = 0.3027, P = 0.0326, respectively). Finally, PWV was negatively correlated with CC with (r = \u20130.6177, P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn type 2 diabetes, the functional changes in CCA can be identified using the methods presented in this article earlier than the structural changes. Arterial stiffness values provided by QAS and X-strain analysis can be used as indicators of CCA functional lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are more likely to suffer from heart diseases because diabetes can cause the arteries to become stiff. This particular study attempts to study these arterial changes in detail by using two different techniques that use sound waves.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe test involved 91 individuals who were divided into two groups: one with diabetes and one without (the control group). By using a device that transmitted sound waves, we studied changes in the wall of an artery in the neck known as the carotid artery. We then compared the findings of the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe thickness of the wall of the carotid artery was pretty similar in both groups. However, the speed at which the pulse travelled and the stiffness of the artery were notably higher in the group with diabetes, whereas the artery's flexibility was significantly lower. The differences in how the arteries moved and adjusted were also significant between the two groups. Additionally, the time taken for certain changes to happen in the arteries were significantly different between the two groups. These time measures were also found to be linked positively with the flexibility of the arteries, whereas the pulse speed was linked negatively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, we can identify functional changes in the carotid artery earlier than structural changes by using the methods described in this study. This suggests the degree of stiffness and elasticity of the artery can serve as indicators of functional issues in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.",

in the literature on the effects of chest physiotherapy on postextubation lung collapse in pediatric age group.  Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of chest physiotherapy in prevention of postextubation atelectasis in pediatric patients.\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS.\nIn a case-control study from March 2007 to March 2011, two groups of patients (35 patients in each group) susceptible to lung collapse were enrolled in the study. The studied patients had neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy, and cerebral palsy. The patients were randomly divided into two groups (case and control); The case group underwent daily chest physiotherapy through vibrator and chest percussion and the control group was under supervision. In the latter group, the underlying disease was treated and the lung collapse was managed, if occurred.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe frequency of atelectasis was lower in the case group who received prophylactic chest physiotherapy compared to the control group (16.6% vs. 40%).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nChest physiotherapy as well as appropriate and regular change of position can considerably reduce the rate of pulmonary collapse in pediatric patients.", "simplification": "GOAL.\nCertain studies have disagreed on whether chest physiotherapy (a treatment involving physical movement and manipulation to breathe better) can help prevent instances of lung collapse in children after they have been on a breathing machine. Our goal was to look into how effective chest physiotherapy is in stopping a collapsed lung in children patients. \n\nWHAT WE DID.\nBetween March 2007 and March 2011, we ran a study comparing two groups of patients (35 kids in each group) who were at risk of lung collapse.

Tools used to track changes included a pain rating scale, a knee health score, and a measure of how far they could move their knee. To check if the medication was safe, any side effects, vital signs (like heart rate and blood pressure), general health checks, lab tests and heart wave tests were also captured and recorded. \n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups showed improvements in their pain levels, knee health scores and range of motion after taking the medicine for a month. However, there was no significant difference in these improvements between the two groups. There were also no major differences in the side effects, vital signs, health checks, lab tests or heart wave tests between the two groups. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe findings show that both the day-long and regular aceclofenac are just as successful in improving symptoms in people with chronic knee arthritis, and they appear to be safely used with no major differences found in this study.

Although several studies have shown positive outcomes in response to spinal flexibility training programs, little is known about the management of sets and repetitions in training protocols. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8-week specific and standardized flexibility training program on the range of spinal motion in elderly women.\n\nMETHODS.\nParticipants were recruited in a senior center of Palermo and randomly assigned in two groups: trained group (TG) and control group (CG), which included 19 and 18 women, respectively. TG was trained for 8 weeks at two sessions/week. In particular, every session included three phases: warm up (~10 minutes), central period (~50 minutes), and cool down (~10 minutes). CG did not perform any physical activity during the experimental period. Spinal ranges of motion (ROM) were measured from neutral standing position to maximum bending position and from neutral standing position to maximum extension position before and after the experimental period, using a SpinalMouse\u00ae device (Idiag, Volkerswill, Switzerland).\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the training period, TG showed an increase in spinal inclination by 16.4% (P<0.05), in sacral/hip ROM by 29.2% (P<0.05), and in thoracic ROM by 22.5% (P>0.05) compared with CG from maximum extension position to maximum bending position. We did not observe any significant difference in TG's lumbar ROM compared with CG after the training period (P>0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWe found that an 8-week flexibility training program improved ROMs of the spine in elderly women.

In this study, we wanted to find out if an eight-week program designed to improve spinal flexibility could increase the range of motion in the back for older women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe got our participants from a senior center in Palermo and split them into two groups: a trained group and a control group. The trained group consisted of 19 women who followed the eight-week exercise program, which they did twice a week. Each exercise session had a ten-minute warm-up, followed by a 50-minute workout and ending with a ten-minute cool-down. The control group, who did not participate in any physical activities, consisted of 18 women. To measure spinal flexibility, we took readings of their back's range of movement at the start and end of the eight weeks using a special device.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the eight weeks, the women who did the exercises saw an average improvement of 16.4% in their forward bending, 29.2% in their back-and-hips bending, and 22.5% in their chest area bending. However, there was no significant improvement in the lower back region.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe results suggest that an eight-week flexibility exercise program can indeed improve the flexibility of elderly women\u2019s backs. This program also seems suitable for older adults who can take care of themselves and stay active.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []},

increasing resistance to antibiotics and rising incidence of oral diseases, there is a need for alternative treatment modalities to combat oral diseases. The aim of the present study was to access the effect of Aloe vera mouthwash on the dental plaque in the experimental period of 4 days and to compare it with the bench mark control chlorhexidine and placebo (saline water).\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nA total of 300 systemically healthy subjects were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Aloe vera mouthwash group (n=100), control group (=100)-chlorhexidene group and saline water-Placebo (n=100). To begin with, Gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were recorded. Then, baseline plaque scores were brought to zero by professionally cleaning the teeth with scaling and polishing. After randomization of the participants into three groups they were refrained from regular mechanical oral hygiene measures. Subjects were asked to swish with respective mouthwash (Aloe vera mouthwash, 0.2%chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, or normal saline) as per therapeutic dose for 4 days.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe results showed that Aloe vera mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing plaque as Chlorhexidine compared to placebo over a period of 4 days. There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them (p>0.05). Aloe vera mouthwash showed no side effects.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe results of the present study indicated that Aloe vera may prove an effective mouthwash due to its ability in reducing dental plaque.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThere's a growing problem with antibiotics not working as effectively, and more people are experiencing oral diseases. This study was to see if Aloe vera mouthwash could help with oral health issues, particularly dental plaque. Specifically, we wanted to see how Aloe vera mouthwash worked over four days, compared to the usual mouthwash (chlorhexidine) and a mouthwash that isn't supposed to do anything (saline water).\n\nMaterial and Methods.\n300 healthy volunteers were split into three equal groups. One group used Aloe vera mouthwash, another used chlorhexidine mouthwash (the usual stuff), and the third used saline water (which doesn't do anything). At the start, we tested the health of everyone's gums (ginigval index) and how much plaque they had (plaque index). We then cleaned everyone's teeth professionally so everyone started with no plaque. For the next four days, the volunteers only used their assigned mouthwash, without brushing or flossing. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe study found that both the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash were equally good at reducing plaque over those four days. Meanwhile, the saline water didn't do much (as expected). The difference in plaque reduction between the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash wasn't significant enough to matter. Also, no one reported any bad side effects from the Aloe vera mouthwash.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBased on this study, Aloe vera could be a good alternative mouthwash. It was successful in reducing dental plaque, just as effective as the usual chlorhexidine mouthwash, but without any side effects.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0,

hyperchloremic acidosis, which in turn can impair renal function. Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid\u2013base equilibrium, and the renal function.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from urinary sample.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9. The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid\u2013base equilibrium and higher level of NGAL.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes, acid\u2013base equilibrium, kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT01320891).", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis experiment aims to study the effects of two different types of intravenous fluids used during surgery \u2013 \u2018balanced\u2019 and \u2018unbalanced\u2019. There are concerns that the traditional 'unbalanced' fluid could lead to inflammation, change of blood electrolyte levels, acidity issues, and potentially harm the kidneys. 'Balanced' fluids may reduce these impacts.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe experiment is conducted in a double-blind format, meaning neither the patients nor the doctors knew which fluid was being used. The study included 40 patients undergoing major bowel cancer surgery. They were divided into two groups. One group received 'balanced' fluids, and the other received 'unbalanced' fluids. Measurements of several variables were taken at four different time points during and after surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe group that received 'balanced' fluids had higher levels of certain proteins that are linked to lower inflammation and lower levels of a protein that can indicate tissue damage. The group receiving 'unbalanced' fluids had issues with chloride, calcium, and magnesium levels, more acid-base imbalance, and higher levels of a marker for kidney damage.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing 'balanced' fluids during surgery caused less upset in the body's blood chemicals and acid-base balance and was kinder to kidney function. It might also start an early anti-inflammatory response.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under the reference number NCT01320891.", "original_sentences":

and pressing issues in the field of surgery and has a significant impact on our health care system. In too many patients, pain is treated inadequately, causing them needless suffering and they can develop complications as an indirect consequence of pain. Analgesic modalities, if properly applied, can prevent or at least minimize this needless suffering and these complications.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetic drugs by paravertebral and epidural routes in controlling postoperative pain in patients undergoing hip surgeries.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe study involved 60 patients who were undergoing hip surgery under the subarachnoid block. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 patients. Group I (paravertebral group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 2.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 mL/h in the paravertebral space. Group II (epidural group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 mL/hr in the epidural space for 48 hours in the postoperative period. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, vital statistics, rescue analgesia, and procedure time were compared with the corresponding times between the 2 groups by student's t-test and repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni. P < 0.05 was considered significant. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding mean pain score in the first 48 hours.\n\nRESULTS.\nMean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the epidural group compared with the paravertebral group from 2 hours after start of the infusion until 48 hrs. Regional anesthesia procedure time was significantly longer in the epidural group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding frequency of postoperative complications and catheter-related problems.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe results of our study indicate that for patients who are scheduled for hip surgery, both continuous paravertebral and continuous epidural analgesia are effective in controlling postoperative pain but that the former has several crucial advantages.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nControlling pain after surgery is a big challenge in the world of health care. Too many patients do not have their pain effectively controlled, which not only causes them unnecessary suffering but could also lead to other health problems. Proper use of pain relief methods can prevent or at least decrease this unnecessary suffering and these extra health issues.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nWe wanted to compare how well two different methods of giving local anesthetic drugs continuously could control pain after hip surgery. The drugs were given either beside the spinal column (paravertebral) or into the space around the spinal column (epidural).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nOur study involved 60 people getting hip surgery. They were split into 2 groups of 30. One group had a single dose of spinal anesthesia plus a continuous flow of the anesthetic drug beside the spinal column. The other group had the same single dose of spinal anesthesia but a continuous flow of the drug into the space around the spinal column instead. We then compared the levels of pain, basic health measurements, need for additional pain relief, and the time taken to do the procedure between the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nOn average, the group getting the drug into the space around the spinal column had lower blood pressure from 2 hours after the drug was started until 48 hours later. It also took longer to give the anesthetic this way. However, there were no differences in the frequency of surgical complications between the two groups or in the problems related to where the drug was given.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study suggests that continuously giving local anesthetic beside the spinal column or into the space around it both can control pain effectively after hip surgery. However, giving it beside the spinal column might be advantageous in certain ways.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Effective

in the emergency department with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of the first dose of treatment, and the secondary outcomes were changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument score, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) over a 4-hour observation period.

Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of hospitalization for patients who received dexamethasone + salbutamol compared to those who received placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.51).

Treatment with dexamethasone + epinephrine resulted in a statistically significant change in HR over time (P < 0.005) compared to the other groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study adds to a body of evidence suggesting that corticosteroids have no role in the management of bronchiolitis for young infants who are first time wheezers with no risk of atopy.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis research looked at how well infants with a common lung infection called bronchiolitis responded to different combinations of medicines. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study investigated the effects on babies between 1 to 12 months old.

The major goal was to see if combining these drugs could reduce the need for hospital stays. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe study showed that the combination of dexamethasone and epinephrine resulted in the same number of hospital admissions as the other combinations. This was also the case for the combination of dexamethasone and salbutamol. However, the babies receiving these combinations showed improvements in their breathing and heart rates. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study concluded that this does not support the use of corticosteroids

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52\u201385 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale\u2013Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI \u22656) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus \u22123 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (\u22123.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdd-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.", "simplification": "PURPOSE:\nIt has been suggested that a lack of good quality sleep might be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleep, are often low in people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, we wanted to know if adding melatonin to their medication would help. We also wondered if these effects were related to whether or not these patients also had sleep disorders.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nWe tested the effects of adding prolonged-release melatonin (a slow-release form of the hormone) in 80 patients, roughly half men and half women, with an average age of 75 years. These patients had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and were already receiving standard treatment. Some of these patients also had insomnia. For the first two weeks, we tested these patients with a placebo, then for the next 24 weeks, we gave half of them 2 mg of melatonin each night and the other half the placebo. Following this, we gave all patients the placebo for 2 more weeks. We measured how well these patients were thinking, their sleep quality, daily activities, and how safe this treatment was.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe patients who received melatonin for 24 weeks generally thought better and slept more efficiently than those who received the placebo. The patients with insomnia who received melatonin saw a significant improvement in how well they could think and how well they slept. This treatment was safe and well-tolerated.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAdding melatonin to Alzheimer's medication has positive results on thinking ability and sleep, especially in patients who also have insomnia.

Although citrulline contributes to the amelioration of atherosclerosis via endothelial nitric oxide production, it remains unclear whether it affects RCT. This study was undertaken to clarify the effects of citrulline on expressions of specific transporters such as ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 and ABCG1, and the cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I or HDL in vitro and ex vivo. Citrulline increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA and protein levels in THP-1 macrophages, translating into enhanced apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. In the human crossover study, 8 healthy male volunteers (age 30\u201349 years) consumed either 3.2 g/day citrulline or placebo for 1 week. Citrulline consumption brought about significant increases in plasma levels of citrulline and arginine. Supporting the in vitro data, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated under autologous post-citrulline sera demonstrated enhancement of both apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux through increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 expressions, compared to MDM differentiated under pre-citrulline sera.

This study looks at how an amino acid, citrulline, might affect RCT.\n\nCitrulline is known to help reduce the risk of heart disease by supporting the production of a molecule, nitric oxide, which helps keep blood vessels healthy. However, we didn't know if citrulline could impact RCT. \n\nIn this study, we investigated if citrulline could influence some transport mechanisms related to RCT, specifically two proteins (ABCA1 and ABCG1) which help in the process. Also, we examined if citrulline had any effect on how well cholesterol is removed from immune cells (called macrophages) by a protein, apolipoprotein A-I, or by HDL (good cholesterol), both in the lab and in the human body. \n\nWe found that adding citrulline did increase the level of the two important proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1, in the macrophages. This led to better removal of cholesterol by apolipoprotein A-I and HDL. \n\nNext, we looked at people's response to citrulline. Eight healthy men, aged 30-49, were given either citrulline or a placebo (a substance with no effect) for a week. After consuming citrulline, their blood levels of citrulline and another amino acid, arginine, went up significantly. Checking their immune cells again, we saw that the cells were now better at releasing cholesterol, thanks to higher levels of those two proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1. No such changes were observed with the placebo.\n\nOur results suggest that, apart from helping blood vessels stay healthy, citrulline could also reduce the risk of heart disease by boosting the RCT

neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH).\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients with symptomatic nOH due to Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy underwent open-label droxidopa dose optimization (100\u2013600 mg 3 times daily), followed, in responders, by 7-day washout and then a 7-day double-blind trial of droxidopa vs placebo. Outcome measures included patient self-ratings on the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a validated, nOH-specific tool that assesses symptom severity and symptom impact on daily activities.\n\nRESULTS.\nFrom randomization to endpoint (n = 162), improvement in mean OHQ composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by 0.90 units (p = 0.003). Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by 0.73 units (p = 0.010), with maximum change in \"dizziness/lightheadedness.\" Improvement in symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by 1.06 units (p = 0.003), with maximum change for \"standing a long time.\" Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP) increased by 11.2 vs 3.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), and mean supine systolic BP by 7.6 vs 0.8 mm Hg (p < 0.001). At endpoint, supine systolic BP >180 mm Hg was observed in 4.9% of droxidopa and 2.5% of placebo recipients. Adverse events reported in \u22653% of double-blind droxidopa recipients were headache (7.4%) and dizziness (3.7%). No patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn patients with symptomatic nOH, droxidopa improved symptoms and symptom impact on daily activities, with an associated increase in standing systolic BP, and was generally well tolerated.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE.\nThis study provides Class I evidence that in patients with symptomatic nOH who respond to open-label droxidopa, droxidopa improves subjective and objective manifestation of nOH at 7 days.", "simplification": "GOAL\nThe aim was to find out if a drug called droxidopa can help improve a condition where a person's blood pressure drops when they stand up (nOH), specifically in people with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy.\n\nMETHODS\nPatients with the above conditions were given droxidopa in doses that were adjusted according to their response. This was followed by a 7-day break, after which they were given either droxidopa or a placebo for 7 days. Their progress was tracked using a special questionnaire that measures the severity of their symptoms and how it affects their daily activities.\n\nRESULTS\nThe results showed that the patients given droxidopa had a better improvement in their symptoms compared to those given a placebo. They especially felt better about dizziness and standing for long periods. Their standing blood pressure also increased more than those on the placebo. Side effects were rare and included minor headache and dizziness. No patients stopped the treatment because of side effects.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDroxidopa appears to help improve symptoms in patients whose blood pressure drops when they stand up. It seems to improve their daily life functioning and increases their standing blood pressure. Generally, the drug is well tolerated.\n\nEVIDENCE LEVEL\nThis study offers strong evidence that droxidopa helps improve symptoms in patients whose blood pressure drops when they stand up over a 7-day

Group L received a loading dose of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg for 10 minutes while group H received 1.0 \u03bcg/kg. Bispectral index (BIS), systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Ramsay score were recorded at T0 (before loading), TL (just after loading) and T10, 20, 30 (10, 20, 30 minutes after TL). Complications, drug use, lowest BIS and time to reach BIS 80 after termination of dexmedetomidine were recorded during this study.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn group H, BIS value decreased significantly after TL compared to the baseline (T0), while in group L after T10. Between two groups, BIS values showed a significant differences only at T10, BIS of group H was lower than that of group L. Ramsay score showed no significant differences except in TL; the score of group L was significantly lower than that of group H.

induction of general anesthesia.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nFifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe mean age of patients was 36.68 \u00b1 10.8 years. Forty percent of patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean of DBP at min 2, 5, and 15, mean of HR at all time points and mean of MAP at min 2 and 15 between groups were no significantly different (P > 0.05), but mean of SBP at min 10 and 15, mean of DBP at min 10, and mean of MAP at min 5 and 10 in hypertonic saline group was significantly more than the normal group (P < 0.05). Trend of SBP, DBP, HR and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nInfusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study was focused on looking at how giving a strong salt solution (hypertonic saline) by IV before surgery influences low blood pressure that can happen after putting a patient to sleep for the surgery.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe studied 54 patients who were going to have surgery. They were divided into two groups of 27 people each - one group was given a strong salt solution and the other was given a normal salt solution. The strong salt solution was given half an hour before the patient was put to sleep for surgery. We followed the same anesthesia process for all patients. We kept track of the patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, heart rate, and the average pressure in their arteries.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe average age of the patients was about 37 years old, and 40% of them were men. We found that the strong salt solution didn't have a significant effect on the patients' blood pressure or heart rate at certain time points. However, other time points showed a significant increase in the blood pressure and average arterial pressure for patients who were given the strong salt solution.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nGiving a strong salt solution to patients before putting them to sleep for surgery can help avoid a big drop in blood pressure and a faster heart rate.

pressure (CPAP) through high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). Meeting specific physical criteria of 100% relative humidity (RH) and temperature of 37\u00b0C are the basic interventional requirements to administer oxygen for the newborns through a nasal cannula. Recently, two systems, MR850 and PMH7000, received the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to administer heated, humidified HFNC (HHHFNC). These systems are evaluated in this study based on their humidifying and heating capabilities.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThis study was done as an RCT on newborns weighing 1,000 to 1,500 g recovering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) while nCPAP was administered at CDP = 4 cmH2O, Fio2 <30%. Patients were randomized to two groups of 35 receiving HHHFNC after treatment with nCPAP, with one group using MR850 humidifier and the other PMH7000. The patients were compared according to the duration of HHHFNC administration, repeated need for nCPAP respiratory support, the need for invasive ventilation, apnea, chronic lung disease (CLD), nasal trauma, RH, and temperature of the gases.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe average time of support with HHHNFC did not show any significant difference in the two groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in the need for nCPAP, invasive ventilation, apnea, nasal trauma, and CLD. The difference in the levels of average temperature and humidity was significant (P value <0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAlthough the records of temperature and RH in the PMH7000 system was lower than the records from the MR850 system, no clinical priority was observed for respiratory support with HHHNFC in the two systems.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study was done to see how two approved devices, MR850 and PMH7000, worked in providing oxygen therapy to newborn babies through a nasal tube. These systems were monitored to see how well they warmed and moistened (humidified) the oxygen before it was given to the babies to breathe in.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study was performed on babies that weighed between 1,000 and 1,500 grams and were recovering from breathing difficulties. These babies had been given a certain type of breathing support through a nose mask, and were then switched over to one of the two tested systems. The researchers kept track of how long the babies were on these systems, whether the babies went back to the nose mask treatment, whether they needed more invasive breathing support, if they had breath pauses (apnea), lung disease, and nose injuries. They also measured temperature and moisture levels of the oxygen given to the babies.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was no major difference in how long the babies were kept on the systems. Also, there were no significant differences in the need to go back to the nose mask treatment, need for more invasive breathing support, breath pauses, nose injuries, or lung disease. However, there were notable differences in the temperature and moisture levels between the two systems.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nEven though the PMH7000 system didn't warm and moisten the oxygen quite as well as the MR850 system, both systems were about equally good in supporting the babies' breathing.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence":

diabetes is increased despite normal or high bone mineral density, implicating poor bone quality as a risk factor. Raloxifene improves bone material and mechanical properties independent of bone mineral density. This study aimed to determine if raloxifene prevents the negative effects of diabetes on skeletal fragility in diabetes-prone rats. Adult Zucker Diabetic Sprague-Dawley (ZDSD) female rats (20-week-old, n = 24) were fed a diabetogenic high-fat diet and were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of raloxifene or vehicle for 12 weeks. Blood glucose was measured weekly and glycated hemoglobin was measured at baseline and 12 weeks. At sacrifice, femora and lumbar vertebrae were harvested for imaging and mechanical testing. Raloxifene-treated rats had a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with vehicle-treated rats. In addition, raloxifene-treated rats had blood glucose levels significantly lower than both diabetic vehicle-treated rats as well as vehicle-treated rats that did not become diabetic. Femoral toughness was greater in raloxifene-treated rats compared with both diabetic and non-diabetic vehicle-treated ZDSD rats, due to greater energy absorption in the post-yield region of the stress-strain curve. Similar differences between groups were observed for the structural (extrinsic) mechanical properties of energy-to-failure, post-yield energy-to-failure, and post-yield displacement. These results show that raloxifene is beneficial in preventing the onset of diabetes and improving bone material properties in the diabetes-prone ZDSD rat. This presents unique therapeutic potential for raloxifene in preserving bone quality in diabetes as well as in diabetes prevention, if these results can be supported by future experimental and clinical studies.", "simplification": "People with type 2 diabetes tend to have higher chances of bone fractures even though their bone density is normal or even higher than average. This indicates that the quality of their bone might be the real issue. Raloxifene is a drug recognized for increasing bone quality regardless of bone density. This study was conducted to see whether Raloxifene can offset the negative impact of diabetes on bone strength in rats that are prone to diabetes.\n\n24 adult rats which were likely to develop diabetes were chosen for this experiment. They were all females and were 20 weeks old. They were fed a high-fat diet that could lead to diabetes and divided randomly into two groups. One group received daily injections of Raloxifene for 12 weeks and the other group got a placebo. \n\nDuring this period, their blood sugar levels were checked every week. Hemoglobin levels which can give us an idea about long-term blood glucose levels were checked at the start and end of the experiments. The bones in their legs and back were tested after the rats were killed.\n\nThe group of rats that received Raloxifene saw fewer cases of diabetes compared to the placebo group. Additionally, their blood sugar levels were significantly lower than the other group. Importantly, the leg bones of the Raloxifene group were stronger, meaning they didn\u2019t break easily because they could absorb more energy before yielding. It was observed that this picture is similar when looking at the structural features of the bone like energy required to cause a break, the amount of energy beyond which breakage occurs and the distance for which it can stretch beyond this point.\n\nThese results suggest Raloxifene could be beneficial in preventing the start of diabetes and improving bone health in those susceptible to diabetes. If future experiments and patient tests confirm these results, it could be a new way to manage the quality of bone in diabetes patients and simultaneously prevent the onset of diabetes.",

Neuroimaging studies have shown that one of the most important areas corresponding to the working memory is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC). This study was aimed to assess whether bilateral modulation of the DLPFC using a noninvasive brain stimulation, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), modifies the working memory function in healthy adults.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a randomized sham-controlled cross-over study, 60 subjects (30 Males) received sham and active tDCS in two subgroups (anode left/cathode right and anode right/cathode left) of the DLPFC. Subjects were presented working memory n-back task while the reaction time and accuracy were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nA repeated measures, mixed design ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the type of stimulation (sham vs. active) in anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC [F(1,55)= 5.29, P=0.019], but not the inverse polarity worsened accuracy in the 2-back working memory task. There were also no statistically significant changes in speed of working memory [F(1,55)= 0.458,P=0.502] related to type or order of stimulation.\n\nDISCUSSION.\nThe results would imply to a polarity dependence of bilateral tDCS of working memory. Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair working memory, while the reverser stimulation had no effect. Meaning that bilateral stimulation of DLFC would not be a useful procedure to improve working memory.

One area of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), is particularly important for working memory. Our goal in this study was to see if we could change how the DLPFC works to improve memory using a safe, non-invasive method called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had 60 people (half men, half women) take part in our study. We split them into two groups and used tDCS to stimulate different sides of their DLPFC. All participants were given tasks to test their working memory while we measured their speed and accuracy.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur analysis indicated that the type of stimulation mattered. When we stimulated the left side of the DLPFC and reduced activity on the right side, it clearly messed with participants' memory accuracy. However, doing the opposite didn't have any noticeable effect. No changes in speed were seen either way.\n\nDISCUSSION.\nOur results suggest that how we use tDCS on working memory matters, and that stimulating the left side of the DLPFC while reducing activity on the right could disrupt memory. This means that using tDCS on both sides of this part of the brain may not be helpful for improving memory.

malignancies has found to be effective in selected patients. A key limiting factor of these therapies is the relatively low tolerance of the liver parenchyma to radiation. We sought to assess the preventive effects of a combined regimen of pentoxifylline (PTX), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on focal radiation-induced liver injury (fRILI).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS.\nPatients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma who were scheduled for local ablation by radiotherapy (image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy) were prospectively randomized to receive PTX, UDCA and LMWH for 8 weeks (treatment) or no medication (control). Focal RILI at follow-up was assessed using functional hepatobiliary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A minimal threshold dose, i.e. the dose to which the outer rim of the fRILI was formerly exposed to, was quantified by merging MRI and dosimetry data.\n\nRESULTS.\nResults from an intended interim-analysis made a premature termination necessary. Twenty-two patients were included in the per-protocol analysis. Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in the study treatment-group compared with the control (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). Qualitative evidence of fRILI by MRI at 6 weeks was observed in 45.5% of patients in the treatment versus 90.9% of the control group. No significant differences between the groups were observed at the 12-week follow-up.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe post-therapeutic application of PTX, UDCA and low-dose LMWH significantly reduced the extent and incidence fRILI at 6 weeks after radiotherapy. The development of subsequent fRILI at 12 weeks (4 weeks after cessation of PTX, UDCA and LMWH during weeks 1\u20138) in the treatment group was comparable to the control group thus supporting the observation that the agents mitigated fRILI.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nEU clinical trials register 2008-002985-70 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01149304", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nUsing targeted radiation to treat liver cancers can be effective in some patients. However, the liver can only handle a limited amount of radiation before it starts to get damaged. We looked into whether a combination treatment of three drugs - pentoxifylline (PTX), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) - could prevent radiation-induced liver injury.\n\nMETHODS.\nPeople with liver cancer spread from colon cancer who were set for radiation treatment were included. They were randomly chosen to receive either the combination treatment for 8 weeks or no extra medication. We looked for signs of radiation-induced liver injury using a specific type of MRI scan. We also calculated the smallest radiation dose that caused injury by combining MRI results and radiation dose data.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had to stop the study early due to early results. We included 22 patients in the final report. The smallest dose that caused liver injury 6 weeks after radiation treatment was significantly higher in the group receiving the combination treatment compared to the group without (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). At 6 weeks, 45.5% of the treated group showed signs of liver injury compared with 90.9% of the untreated group. There were no noticeable differences between the groups at 12 weeks.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTaking PTX, UDCA and low-dose LMWH after radiation treatment considerably reduced liver injury at 6 weeks after radiation treatment. However, 4 weeks after stopping the drug combination (which was given during weeks 1-8), incidences of liver injury in the treated group were like those in the control group. This supports the notion that these drugs can minimize radiation-induced liver injury. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in the EU clinical trials register (2008-002985-70) and

This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing two web-supported interventions, motivational interviewing (MIC) and nutrition psychoeducation (NPC), an attention-control intervention, to usual care (UC).\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS.\n89 overweight/obese patients, with and without binge eating disorder (BED), were randomly assigned to MIC, NPC, or UC for 3 months in PC. Patients were assessed independently at post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up\n\nRESULTS.\nWeight, triglyceride levels, and depression scores decreased significantly in NPC when compared to UC but not MIC; UC and MIC did not differ significantly. Weight-loss results maintained at 3-month follow-up: approximately 25% MIC and NPC patients achieved at least 5% weight-loss which did not differ by BED status. Fidelity ratings were high and treatment adherence was associated with weight loss.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis is the first RCT in PC testing MI for obesity to include an attention-control intervention (NPC).

The results were compared to people who received standard care (UC).\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS.\nThe study involved 89 overweight people, some of whom also struggled with binge eating disorder (BED). These participants were randomly assigned to one of the three approaches (MIC, NPC, or UC) for three months. Afterword, the researchers checked on their progress and followed up with them 3 months later.\n\nRESULTS.\nParticipants who received NPC showed a greater reduction in weight, blood fat levels, and feelings of sadness compared to UC and MIC. However, there was no significant difference between UC and MIC. About 25% of participants in the MIC and NPC groups achieved at least 5% weight loss at the 3-month follow-up. This result was not impacted by whether or not the participant had binge eating disorder. The success of the treatment was linked to how well the participant stuck with the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis is the first study of its kind to test motivational interviewing as a method for weight loss in a primary care setting, while also testing a control intervention (NPC). The NPC method showed better results than MIC or standard care.

versus envelope type of coronally advanced flap plus type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) in the treatment of multiple buccal gingival recessions, using the split mouth study.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nTen patients in the age group of 20-50 years showing bilateral gingival recessions were treated. The defects in each patient were randomly assigned as Group A, which were treated with the envelope type of CAF, and those in Group B were treated with envelope type of CAF along with the Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM). The recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and width of the keratinized tissue (KT) were measured at baseline, at three and six month intervals.\n\nRESULTS.\nForty-six Miller's class I and II gingival recessions were treated. In the CAF + Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)-treated (Group B) sites the baseline gingival recession was 2.34 \u00b1 0.48 mm, while in the CAFtreated (Group A) sites it was 2.52 \u00b1 0.84 mm. Both the treatments resulted in significant recession depth reduction (P < 0.001), but the reduction was significantly greater (P < 0.01) for Group B than Group A. The probing depth changes were significant (P < 0.01) for both groups, but the difference was nonsignificant. Similarly, a significant gain of CAL was seen in Group B (2.23 \u00b1 0.75 mm, P < 0.001) as well as in group A (1.60 \u00b1 0.86 mm, P < 0.001) showing a significant difference (P < 0.01) between the two groups. The width of keratinized tissue was also significantly (P < 0.001) increased in both groups, but the increase was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in group B (2.30 \u00b1 1.06 mm) than in group A (1.21 \u00b1 0.67 mm).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe envelope type of CAF along with Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM) was more effective than envelope type of CAF alone, in producing root coverage in multiple gingival recession defects, associated with gain in CAL as also in the width of KT.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at two ways of treating gum recession and compares how effectively they work. One method uses a surgical technique called the envelope-type of coronally advanced flap (CAF) by itself. The other method combines this surgical technique with a collagen membrane (NEOMEM). \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study involved ten people aged between 20 and 50 who had gum recession on both sides of their mouth. Each person's gum recession was split into two groups. Group A was treated using just the surgical technique and Group B used the surgical technique and the collagen membrane. The team measured the depth and width of the gum recession, as well as other factors at the start of the study and after three and six months. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe team treated 46 cases of gum recession during the study. In Group B - where the surgical technique was combined with the collagen membrane - the average original depth of the gum recession was about 2.34mm. In Group A, where only the surgical technique was used, this was roughly 2.52mm. Both treatments effectively reduced the depth of the gum recession, but the reduction was significantly more in Group B. Both treatments also saw significant changes in the other factors that were measured. However, the changes were much more pronounced in Group B.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe combination of the surgical technique and the collagen membrane was more effective at treating gum recession than the surgical technique alone. This combination also led to better results in the gain of gum attachment as well as the width of the keratinized tissue, which is the outer, protective layer of the gums.", "original_sentences":

tumors.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo hundred patients with malignant tumors were randomly divided into a study group and a control group, with 100 patients in each group. During the treatment, patients in the study group received mental clinical nursing pathway care, while those in the control group were given the usual nursing care, such as timely inspection, nurse's reactions to patient's behavior, and execution of medical orders. Thereafter, the \"self-rating idea of suicide scale\" and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) were used to compare the differences in the suicidal ideation of patients with malignant tumors between the two groups before and after the treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no statistical differences in the scores of despair factor, optimistic factor, sleep factor, and cover factor between the two groups before the treatment (P>0.05). After different styles of nursing, the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the score of cover factor between the two groups (P>0.05). The KPS of patients receiving mental clinical nursing pathway care was higher than those receiving usual nursing care, and there was a statistical significant difference between the two groups (P<0.01). Interestingly, the patients' suicidal ideation scale was negatively correlated with KPS (r =\u22120.29, P<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor individuals diagnosed with a malignant tumor, using a mental health clinical nursing pathway can effectively decrease the degree of suicidal ideation and positively impact the quality of life.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study was made to look into how special mental health nursing plans can help reduce thoughts of suicide and improve life quality in patients suffering from serious cancer types.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo groups of 100 serious cancer patients each were formed - one was the study group and the other was the control group. Patients in the study group were given special mental health nursing care, while those in the control group received normal nursing care. After this, we used two tools - a 'self-rating suicide thoughts scale' and a method to assess physical and mental abilities (Karnofsky Performance Status/KPS), to see the change in suicidal thoughts among the cancer patients in the two groups, before and after the treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the different nursing styles were given, the two groups didn't really differ on the factors of despair, optimism, sleep, and hiding their feelings. After the special nursing, patients from the study group showed lower levels in these areas than the control group, except for hiding their feelings where there was no big difference. Patients who did receive the special mental health nursing showed higher physical and mental abilities (KPS), and there was a clear difference between the two groups. Additionally, the more the physical and mental abilities increased, the less the suicide thoughts occurred.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor patients diagnosed with a serious type of cancer, following a special

"OBJECTIVES.\nTo evaluate the effect of certolizumab pegol (CZP) on productivity outside and within the home, and on participation in family, social and leisure activities in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).\n\nMETHODS.\nRAPID-PsA (NCT01087788) is a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 409 patients with active PsA were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo, CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). The arthritis-specific Work Productivity Survey (WPS) assessed the impact of PsA on paid work and household productivity, and participation in social activities during the preceding month. WPS responses were compared between treatment arms using a non-parametric bootstrap-t method.\n\nRESULTS.\nAt baseline, 56.6%, 60.1% and 61.5% of placebo, CZP 200 mg Q2W and CZP 400 mg Q4W patients were employed. By week 24, employed CZP patients reported an average of 1.0\u20131.8 and 3.0\u20133.9 fewer days of absenteeism and presenteeism, respectively, per month compared with 1.0 and 0.3 fewer days for placebo patients (p<0.05). Within the home, by week 24, CZP patients reported an average of 3.0\u20133.5 household work days gained per month versus 1.0 day for placebo (p<0.05). CZP patients also reported fewer days with reduced household productivity or days lost for participation in family, social and leisure activities. Improvements with CZP were seen as early as week 4 and continued to week 24.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nCZP treatment significantly improved productivity at paid work and within the home, and resulted in greater participation in social activities for PsA patients.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.\nNCT01087788.", "simplification": "GOAL OF THE STUDY:\nThis study aimed to check how a drug called certolizumab pegol (CZP) helps adults with a type of arthritis, known as psoriatic arthritis (PsA), in their work life, home life, as well as in their ability to participate in family gatherings, socials and their hobbies.\n\nHOW THE STUDY WAS DONE:\nA large-scale trial involving 409 adults with PsA was conducted using either CZP or a placebo. They were divided into three groups - one got a placebo, one got a middle dose of CZP every 2 weeks, and the third received a higher dose of CZP every 4 weeks. A survey was used to measure if the drug increased productivity at work and home, and participation in various activities over a month. This survey data was then statistically examined and compared between the groups.\n\nWHAT THE STUDY FOUND:\nWhen the study started, a little over half of the people in each of the three groups had jobs. By week 24, those taking CZP were able to work more, missing 1.0 to 1.8 days less in a month due to illness and experiencing 3.0 to 3.9 fewer days of reduced productivity while at work compared to those taking the placebo. At home, the individuals on CZP also were more productive, gaining an average of 3 to 3.5 days of productive household work in a month. They also participated more in social and family activities and hobbies. These benefits started to appear as early as the 4th week and continued till the 24th week of the treatment.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS:\nThe drug CZP can significantly help improve the work, home productivity, and social engagement of adults dealing with psoriatic arthritis.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVES.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "To evaluate the

of developing hypertensive conditions of pregnancy, i.e. pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PE/PIH). In the present study, we evaluated Se status in UK pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 UK primiparous women to treatment with Se (60 \u03bcg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. UK pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than US women, GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women, and low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3\u00b700, range 0\u00b790\u20135\u00b780 mg/l). Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0\u00b7040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0\u00b7054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0\u00b738, 95 % CI 0\u00b717, 0\u00b787, P= 0\u00b7021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0\u00b730, 95 % CI 0\u00b709, 1\u00b700, P= 0\u00b7049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH.

Mothers-to-be who consume inadequate amounts of selenium may be more likely to develop these conditions.\n\nThe study involved 230 first-time mothers in the UK who were randomly chosen to either receive a selenium supplement or a placebo from the 12th week of pregnancy onwards. Researchers took multiple measurements and assessments related to the women's selenium levels throughout the pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers found that the selenium levels of pregnant women in the UK were lower compared to those of pregnant women in other countries. Factors like age, level of education, and social class positively impacted selenium levels. Women who ate Brazil nuts or consumed more than two seafood servings a week also showed higher selenium levels. \n\nThe research revealed that the lower the selenium level in the toenails (which is an indicator of the body's selenium status), the higher the chances were for a woman to develop PIH or PE. Women who took the selenium supplement were found to be less at risk of developing these conditions.\n\nTo sum up, the study concluded that women in the UK planning to have children should increase their selenium intake, as low levels of this mineral may increase their chances of developing PIH or PE.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "Dietary intake/status of the trace mineral Se may affect

brimonidine 0.2% in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)/ocular hypertension (OHT).\n\nSETTINGS AND DESIGN.\nOpen, randomized, cross-over, comparative study.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nForty patients of POAG or OHT with intraocular pressure (IOP) <30 mm Hg were included in the study after a written informed consent. The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 20 patients each. Patients of group A were administered bimatoprost 0.03% eye drops once daily, and those of group B brimonidine 0.2% eye drops twice daily for a period of 4 weeks. After a washout period of 4 weeks, the patients were crossed over that is, group A was administered brimonidine 0.2% and group B bimatoprost 0.03%. Fall in IOP at 4 weeks was recorded. The daily cost of each drug was calculated by maximum retail price and the average number of drops per bottle. The cost-effectiveness was then calculated as the cost of drug/mm Hg fall in IOP.\n\nSTATISTICS.\nIndependent samples t-test was used to compare the efficacy of both drugs.\n\nRESULTS.\nIOP lowering with bimatoprost (8.9 \u00b1 1.598 mm Hg) was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than brimonidine (6.55 \u00b1 1.26 mm Hg). The number of drops/ml were 33.43 \u00b1 0.52 and 25.49 \u00b1 0.26, respectively, for bimatoprost and brimonidine. Treatment with bimatoprost was costlier than brimonidine with daily costs/eye Rs. 4.02 \u00b1 0.06 and 3.14 \u00b1 0.03, yearly costs/eye Rs. 1467.46 \u00b1 20.74 and 1147.75 \u00b1 11.15, respectively. Bimatoprost was more cost-effective than brimonidine with the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) respectively Rs. 13.10 \u00b1 2.61/mm Hg and Rs. 13.96 \u00b1 2.86/mm Hg. Incremental CER Rs. 10.43/mm Hg implies lower costs/mm Hg extra IOP lowering by bimatoprost than Rs. 13.96 for brimonidine.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn spite of being costlier, bimatoprost is more efficacious and cost-effective than brimonidine.", "simplification": "GOAL:\nWe wanted to see if two particular eye drops, bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2%, work well and are good value for money for people with a specific eye condition causing increased eye pressure (called primary open-angle glaucoma) or high eye pressure (ocular hypertension).\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe carried out a study involving 40 volunteers who had these conditions but only mild eye pressure. We randomly divided them into two different groups. Half of them were given bimatoprost drops once a day, while the other half used brimonidine drops twice a day, for a month. After resting for a month, we switched the groups: the first group started using brimonidine, and the second group used bimatoprost. We recorded the drop in eye pressure after a month for both groups. We then calculated the cost per day of both treatments, and how much it cost per unit of pressure dropped (cost-effectiveness).\n\nHOW WE FIGURED OUT THE RESULTS:\nWe used a common statistical method to compare how effective both drugs were.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that bimatoprost was significantly more effective, reducing eye pressure more than brimonidine. However, bimatoprost was also more expensive on a per drop basis than brimonidine. Despite the higher price, when looking at the cost in relation to how much it lowers eye pressure, bimatoprost ended up being a more cost-effective option than brimonidine.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAlthough it's a bit more expensive, bimatoprost is more effective and gives you more bang for your buck than brimonidine when it comes to treating these eye conditions.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence":

butylbromide, atropine, glucagon, and cimetropium bromide. This study examined the efficacy of oral phloroglucin for the suppression of peristalsis, its impact on patient compliance, and any associated complications, and compared it with intravenous or intramuscular cimetropium bromide administration.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis was a randomized, investigator-blind, prospective comparative study. A total of 172 patients were randomized into two groups according to the following medications administered prior to upper endoscopy: oral phloroglucin (group A, n=86), and cimetropium bromide (group B, n=86). The numbers and the degrees of peristalsis events at the antrum and second duodenal portion were assessed for 30 seconds.\n\nRESULTS.\nA significantly higher number of gastric peristalsis events was observed in group A (0.49 vs. 0.08, p<0.001), but the difference was not clinically significant. No significant difference between both groups was found in the occurrence of duodenal peristalsis events (1.79 vs. 1.63, p=0.569). The incidence of dry mouth was significantly higher with cimetropium bromide than with phloroglucin (50% vs. 15.1%, p<0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOral phloroglucin can be used as an antispasmodic agent during upper endoscopy, and shows antispasmodic efficacy and adverse effects similar to those of cimetropium bromide.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND/GOALS\nDuring certain stomach and gut examinations (like endoscopy), it's common to use medications that help relax these areas. This study looked at how well taking a certain medication, called phloroglucin, worked for this purpose, and how well it was tolerated by patients. Its effects were compared to another medication known as cimetropium bromide that's normally given by injection.\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was conducted blindly and participants were randomly divided into two groups. Each group was given a different medication before the endoscopy. Group A received phloroglucin orally, and group B received cimetropium bromide. The researchers then looked at the number and intensity of muscle contractions in two specific parts of the digestive system for 30 seconds.\n\nRESULTS\nThey found that the group taking phloroglucin had more stomach muscle contractions, but the difference wasn't important in a clinical sense. There was no significant difference in muscle contractions in the first part of the small intestine between the two groups. More patients who received cimetropium bromide reported dry mouth than those who took phloroglucin.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPhloroglucin taken orally appears to work as effectively as cimetropium bromide for relaxing the stomach and gut during an endoscopy. It also seems to have similar side effects. The advantage of phloroglucin is that it's less likely to cause dry mouth.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND/AIMS.", "start": 0, "end": 16, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Suppression of

intervention, based on family-centered empowerment and Pender's health promotion models, on health-promoting lifestyle and health-related QoL among methamphetamine users and their

allocated to three groups: a group for training of methamphetamine users who were in recovery phase (intervention group 1;95 subjects);a group for training of a family member of methamphetamine users who were in recovery phase (intervention group 2; 95 subjects); and a control group (95 subjects). A demographic checklist and a standard questionnaire covering health-promoting lifestyle, health-related QoL, self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers dimensions were used to gather required data.

They were split up into three groups: one group of the drug users themselves, one group of their family members, and a third control group. We asked them a series of questions about their lifestyle, health, self confidence, emotions, social support, and potential obstacles.\n\nRESULTS:\nAfter adjusting for previous test scores, there was a significant improvement in the lifestyle, health, and other areas for the drug users and their families who went through the empowerment program. The control group didn't see these changes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nUsing a family-centered empowerment approach with drug users and their families is possible and can lead to better health, improved

increase in the number of people with dementia and the detrimental impact on the mental health of family caregivers.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis study assessed the effectiveness of the Internet intervention 'Mastery over Dementia'. In a RCT, 251 caregivers, of whom six were lost at baseline, were randomly assigned to two groups. Caregivers in the experimental group (N = 149) were compared to caregivers who received a minimal intervention consisting of e-bulletins (N = 96). Outcomes were symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS-A). All data were collected via the Internet, and an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.\n\nRESULTS.\nAlmost all caregivers were spouses or children (in-law). They were predominantly female and lived with the care recipient in the same household. Age of the caregivers varied from 26 to 87 years. Level of education varied from primary school to university, with almost half of them holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Regression analyses showed that caregivers in the experimental group showed significantly lower symptoms of depression (p = .034) and anxiety (p = .007) post intervention after adjustment for baseline differences in the primary outcome scores and the functional status of the patients with dementia. Effect sizes were moderate for symptoms of anxiety (.48) and small for depressive symptoms (.26).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe Internet course 'Mastery over Dementia' offers an effective treatment for family caregivers of people with dementia reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results of this study justify further development of Internet interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia and suggest that such interventions are promising for keeping support for family caregivers accessible and affordable. The findings are even more promising because future generations of family caregivers will be more familiar with the Internet.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDutch Trial Register NTR-2051 www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2051", "simplification": "BACKGROUND:\nThe World Health Organization emphasizes that support for caregivers, especially those taking care of people with dementia, should be both affordable and easy to access. This is due to the growing number of people who have dementia and the negative effects on the mental health of the family members who care for them.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe ran a study to see if an online program called 'Mastery over Dementia' could help. We had 251 caregivers participate, but 6 dropped out right at the beginning. The caregivers were randomly split into two groups. One group (149 people) used the online program and we compared them to the second group (96 people) who only received informational emails. We wanted to see if there was a change in signs of depression and anxiety. The caregivers answered all our questions through the internet and we made sure to include everyone's data in the final analysis.\n\nRESULTS:\nMost of the caregivers were husbands, wives, or children of the person with dementia. Most of them were women who lived in the same house as the person they were caring for. Their ages ranged from 26 to 87 and their education background varied greatly, with about half having at least a college degree. We discovered that the caregivers who used the online program had noticeably less signs of depression and anxiety after using the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur study shows that the 'Mastery over Dementia' online program can be a useful tool for family caregivers of people with dementia since it reduces signs of depression and anxiety. This suggests that developing more online resources like this could be beneficial for family caregivers, making support more accessible and financially manageable. This is promising for the future generations of caregivers who will likely be familiar with using the internet.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nYou can find more details about this study in the Dutch Trial

Furthermore, healthy controls revealed increased rsFC of the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus in this network relative to the placebo treatment in patients.

They compared the brain activity of these patients when they took heroin and when they took a placebo, to a group of healthy individuals who only took a placebo. \n\nThey found that heroin increased the connectivity in a part of the brain called the left putamen, which led the patients to feel a \"rush\". This feeling was positively linked to the level of morphine (derived from heroin) in their blood. However, in healthy individuals, a different part of the brain became more active compared to the patients when they took placebo.\n\nIn conclusion, their findings suggest that the feeling of reward

SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; the final evaluation was 05/2013.\n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males/4females, mean age 72 \u00b1 7 years; TACE: 10males/2females, mean age 71 \u00b1 9 years), initial tumor load (1 patient \u226525 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12\u00d7B; TACE 1\u00d7A, 11\u00d7B).

Causes of death were liver failure (n = 4 SIRT group), tumor progression (n = 4 TACE group), cardiovascular events, and inconclusive (n = 1 in each group).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nNo significant differences were found in median PFS, OS, and TTP.

People who got SIRT could have the treatment repeated if the cancer came back. Those on DEB-TACE got the treatment every six weeks until MRI scans showed no sign of cancer, or further treatment wasn't advisable due to other health reasons. We checked on the patients every three months with an MRI, with the final check-up in May 2013.\n\nRESULTS\nBoth treatment groups had similar characteristics. Half the people were men, the average age was around 72, the cancer had spread about the same amount, and were at a similar stage according to a liver cancer staging system. On average, the SIRT group continued without the cancer spreading for 180 days, and the DEB-TACE group for 216 days. It took about a year for the cancer to spread for both groups. The SIRT group lived for an average of 592 days, and the DEB-TACE group for 788 days. Seven people died in each group. The reasons for death included liver failure, the cancer spreading, heart events, and one unknown cause.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNo major differences were found between the two types of treatment regarding how long patients lived, how long before the cancer spread, or the time before the treatment stopped working.

We repeatedly screened to find an effective food to treat obesity and discovered that rosehip extract shows potent anti-obesity effects. Investigations in mice have demonstrated that rosehip extract inhibits body weight gain and decreases visceral fat. Thus, the present study examined the effect of rosehip extract on human body fat in preobese subjects.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 32 subjects who had a body mass index of \u226525 but <30. The subjects were assigned to two random groups, and they received one tablet of placebo or rosehip that contained 100 mg of rosehip extract once each day for 12 weeks with no dietary intervention. Abdominal fat area and body fat percent were measured as primary outcomes. The other outcomes were body weight and body mass index.\n\nRESULTS.\nAbdominal total fat area, abdominal visceral fat area, body weight, and body mass index decreased significantly in the rosehip group at week 12 compared with their baseline levels (P<0.01) after receiving the rosehip tablet intake, and the decreases in these parameters were significantly higher when compared with those in the placebo group. Additionally, body fat percent tended to decrease compared with the placebo group and their baseline level. Moreover, the abdominal subcutaneous fat area was significantly lower in the rosehip group than in the placebo group at week 12 after the initiation of intake (P<0.05). In addition, there were no abnormalities, subjective symptoms, and findings that may indicate clinical problems during the study period.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThese results suggest that rosehip extract may be a good candidate food material for preventing obesity.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nObesity is a big issue worldwide. In our search for food that can help tackle obesity, we found that rosehip extract can help reduce weight gain and cut down belly fat, as shown in tests on mice. Now, we want to see if it works on humans too, in people who are a little overweight.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe ran a 12-week experiment involving 32 people who were slightly overweight. They were divided into two groups, with one group given a placebo (dummy pill), and the other given a rosehip tablet containing 100mg of rosehip extract. They took one pill every day for 12 weeks, and didn\u2019t change their eating habits. We looked at changes in belly fat and body fat percentage mainly, as well as any changes in body weight and BMI (body mass index).\n\nRESULTS.\nThose in the rosehip group lost a significant amount of belly fat, weight, and had a lower BMI by the end of the 12 weeks. These reductions were much more significant compared to the placebo group. There was also a trend towards a lower body fat percentage in the rosehip group. Moreover, the fat just under the skin in the belly area was significantly lower in the rosehip group than the placebo group by week 12. Also, there were no health problems reported during the study.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThese findings suggest that rosehip extract might be a good potential food item to help prevent obesity.",

underdiagnosed cause of lower back pain. SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.\n\nRESULTS.\nSubjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority >0.999). Clinically important (\u226515 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 27.3% of NSM subjects. At six months, quality of life improved more in the surgery group and satisfaction rates were high. The mean number of adverse events in the first six months was slightly higher in the surgical group compared to the non-surgical group (1.3 vs. 1.0 events per subject, p=0.1857).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nSix-month follow-up from this level 1 study showed that minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving function and improving quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE.\nMinimally invasive SI joint fusion is an acceptable option for patients with chronic SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroiliac joint disruptions unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nLower back pain is often caused by a problem in the area where your spine connects to your hips, called the sacroiliac joint. Sometimes, this pain can be treated by using surgery to fuse or join together parts of this joint. However, we don't have any studies yet that have compared how patients do with this surgery versus without it.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe set up a study with 148 patients who had problems with their sacroiliac joint. We randomly picked some to get a special kind of low-impact surgery (102 people), while others (46 people) were treated without surgery. We measured how much pain and disability our patients were feeling when the study started. Then, we checked on them 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to see if there was an improvement. \n\nRESULTS.\nOur patients, most of whom were women and averaged 51 years of age, were having a lot of trouble with pain and disability at the start of the study. We were able to follow up with almost all of them at the six-month mark. By then, about 81.4% of the surgery patients were doing significantly better, compared to 23.9% of the non-surgery group. Also, 75% of the surgery group showed great improvement in how they were able to move around and do daily activities versus 27.3% in the non-surgery group. Finally, the surgery patients generally felt happier and more satisfied. \nHowever, it's worth mentioning that slightly more surgery patients experienced complications or side effects than non-surgery patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAfter six months, the results of our high-level study show that the low-impact surgery is much more effective than non-surgery treatment in reducing pain, improving motion, and increasing the happiness of patients who have problems with their sacroiliac joint.\n\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE. \nThis less-invasive surgery could be a good treatment option for patients with

scales: Lequesne's Algofunctional Questionnaire and Oswestry Disability Index, trunk and hip range of motion, goniometry, trunk and hip muscle strength assessment using load cell, and surface electromyography of the iliocostalis, long dorsal (longissimus), gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. Ten patients were randomized into two groups: aquatic physiotherapy with a mean age of 42 years (range: 25\u201367) and conventional physiotherapy with a mean age of 49 years (range: 43\u201359). Both groups were submitted to a twelve-week program of two sessions weekly.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the intervention, significant improvements were observed regarding the Lequesne index (p-value = 0.0217), Oswestry Disability Index (p-value = 0.0112), range of motion of trunk extension (p-value = 0.0320), trunk flexion muscle strength (p-value = 0.0459), hip extension and abduction muscle strength (p-value = 0.0062 and p-value = 0.0257, respectively). Range of motion of trunk and hip flexion, extension, adduction and abduction, trunk extensor muscle strength and all surface electromyography variables showed no significant statistical difference.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPhysical therapy is efficient to treat musculoskeletal dysfunctions in sickle cell disease patients, irrespective of the technique; however, aquatic therapy showed a trend toward improvement in muscle strength.

We examined things like pain levels, flexibility, strength, and muscle activity. We divided ten patients into two groups: one did water exercises and the other did normal gym exercises. Both groups had two sessions a week for twelve weeks.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nAfter the twelve weeks, both groups saw improvements in pain levels, flexibility, and strength. However, there was no notable difference in improvement between the two groups. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nPhysical exercise, whether it's done in water or on land, can help to treat muscle problems in patients with sickle cell disease.

cited as important causes of sleep deprivation in critically ill patients. Previous studies indicated that using earplugs and eye masks can improve REM sleep in healthy subjects in simulated ICU environment, and improve sleep quality in ICU patients. This study aimed to determine the effects of using earplugs and eye masks with relaxing background music on sleep, melatonin and cortisol levels in ICU patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nFifty patients who underwent a scheduled cardiac surgery and were expected to stay at least 2 nights in Cardiac Surgical ICU (CSICU) were included. They were randomized to sleep with or without earplugs and eye masks combined with 30-minute relaxing music during the postoperative nights in CSICU. Urine was analyzed for nocturnal melatonin and cortisol levels. Subjective sleep quality was evaluated using the Chinese version of Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (a visual analog scale, ranging 0\u2013100).\n\nRESULTS.\nData from 45 patients (20 in intervention group, 25 in control group) were analyzed. Significant differences were found between groups in depth of sleep, falling asleep, awakenings, falling asleep again after awakening and overall sleep quality (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Perceived sleep quality was better in the intervention group. No group differences were found in urinary melatonin levels and cortisol levels for the night before surgery, and the first and second nights post-surgery (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The urinary melatonin levels of the first and second postoperative nights were significantly lower than those of the night before surgery (P\u2009=\u20090.01). The opposite pattern was seen with urinary cortisol levels (P\u2009=\u20090.00).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis combination of non-pharmacological interventions is useful for promoting sleep in ICU adult patients; however, any influence on nocturnal melatonin levels and cortisol level may have been masked by several factors such as the timing of surgery, medication use and individual differences. Larger scale studies would be needed to examine the potential influences of these factors on biological markers and intervention efficacy on sleep.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-IOR-14005511.

Previous research suggested that earplugs and eye masks can improve sleep in both healthy individuals and ICU patients. Our goal was to see the effects of earplugs, eye masks, and peaceful background music on sleep and certain hormone levels in ICU patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe included fifty heart surgery patients who were expected to spend at least two nights in the cardiac ICU. We randomly chose some patients to sleep with earplugs, eye masks, and 30 minutes of soothing music. We measured sleep quality and hormone levels in their urine.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe used data from 45 patients. The patients who used the earplugs and eye masks with music reported deeper sleep, less trouble falling asleep, and less waking up during the night. Despite this noticeable improvement in sleep quality, the hormone levels didn't have any significant differences between both groups before or after the surgery. We noticed a drop in melatonin (a hormone that helps control sleep) levels on post-surgery nights compared to before surgery. Conversely, cortisol (a hormone linked to stress) levels were higher after surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nCombining earplugs, eye masks, and calming music can effectively help ICU patients sleep better. However, factors like surgery timings, medication, and individual differences might have hidden any impacts on hormone levels. Further extensive studies are needed to explore the potential influences of these factors on hormone levels and the effectiveness of this sleep promoting technique.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial

cannabis, \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs human facial affect recognition, implicating the endocannabinoid system in emotional processing. Another main constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has seemingly opposite functional effects on the brain. This study aimed to determine the effects of THC and CBD, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, THC (8 mg), CBD (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. In comparison to placebo, CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% emotional intensity; THC was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces of 40% intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both THC alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 'stoned'. CBD did not influence feelings of 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, CBD improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by THC.

intramuscular injections in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized to receive injections of 8 or 16 mg VM202 per leg or placebo. Divided doses were administered on Day 0 and Day 14. The prospective primary outcome was change in the mean pain score measured by a 7 day pain diary. Secondary outcomes included a responder analysis, quality of life and pain measures, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no significant adverse events attributable to VM202. Eighty-four patients completed the study. Patients receiving 8 mg VM202 per leg improved the most in all efficacy measures including a significant (P = 0.03) reduction at 3 months in the mean pain score and continued but not statistically significant reductions in pain at 6 and 9 months. Of these patients, 48.4% experienced a \u226550% reduction in pain compared to 17.6% of placebo patients. There were also significant improvements in the brief pain inventory for patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and the questionnaire portion of the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. Patients not on pregabalin or gabapentin had the largest reductions in pain.\n\nINTERPRETATION.\nVM202 was safe, well tolerated and effective indicating the feasibility of a nonviral gene therapy approach to painful diabetic neuropathy. Two days of treatment were sufficient to provide symptomatic relief with improvement in quality of life for 3 months. VM202 may be particularly beneficial for patients not taking gabapentin or pregabalin.", "simplification": "GOAL.\nThis study aimed to test if a medicine (VM202) containing two proteins beneficial for liver growth, delivered through muscle injections, can be used safely and effectively to reduce pain in patients suffering from diabetes-related nerve pain.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a scientifically controlled study, patients were randomly chosen to get injections of two different amounts of VM202 or a placebo. They received injections on the first day and again two weeks later. The main goal was to see if there was a change in the average pain score collected through a week-long pain diary. Secondary goals included how many patients responded to the treatment, improvements in quality of life and pain measurements, and the density of nerves in the skin.\n\nRESULTS.\nNo major side effects related to VM202 were reported. Eighty-four patients finished the study. Patients who got the lower dosage of VM202 reported the most improvement in all areas measured, including a significant reduction in average pain after 3 months, and continued but statistically not significant reductions in pain at 6 and 9 months. Nearly half of these patients felt pain reduced by at least 50%, compared to 17.6% using the placebo. These patients also reported significant improvements in a standard pain survey for diabetic neuropathy and a standard questionnaire about neuropathy. Patients who were not already on specific pain medicines had the largest reductions in pain.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nVM202 showed that it was safe, tolerated well, and effective, indicating it could potentially be used as a new gene therapy approach to treat diabetes-related nerve pain. Just two days of treatment provided symptom relief and improved quality of life for three months.

"BACKGROUND.\nSupratentorial pneumocephalus after posterior fossa surgery in the semisitting position may lead to decreased alertness and other symptoms. We here aimed to prove the efficacy of normobaric hyperoxia on the absorption of postoperative pneumocephalus according to a standardized treatment protocol.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS.\nWe enrolled 44 patients with postoperative supratentorial pneumocephalus (> 30 ml) after posterior fossa surgery in a semisitting position. After randomisation procedure, patients received either normobaric hyperoxia at FiO2 100% over an endotracheal tube for 3 hours (treatment arm) or room air (control arm). Routine cranial CT scans were performed immediately (CT1) and 24 hours (CT2) after completion of surgery and were rated without knowledge of the therapy arm. Two co-primary endpoints were assessed: (i) mean change of pneumocephalus volume, and (ii) air resorption rate in 24 hours. Secondary endpoints were subjective alertness (Stanford Sleepiness Scale) postoperatively and attention (Stroop test), which were evaluated preoperatively and 24 hours after surgery. The mean change in pneumocephalus volume was higher in patients in the treatment arm as compared to patients in the control arm (p = 0.001). The air resorption rate was higher in patients in the treatment arm as compared to patients in the control arm (p = 0.0015). Differences were more pronounced in patients aged 52 years and older. No difference between patients in treatment arm and control arm was observed for the Stroop test. The distribution of scores in the Stanford Sleepiness Scale differed in the treatment arm as compared to the control arm, and there was a difference in mean values (p = 0.015).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAdministration of normobaric hyperoxia at FiO2 100% via an endotracheal tube for 3 hours is safe and efficacious in the treatment of pneumocephalus after posterior fossa surgery in the semisitting position. Largest benefit was found in elderly patients and particularly in older men.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nGerman Clinical Trials Register DRKS00006273", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nSometimes after a type of brain surgery, patients can experience symptoms such as alertness loss due to a condition where air fills up their brain cavities. We studied whether treating this condition with pure oxygen via a breathing tube can help absorb this air build-up.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS.\nWe investigated 44 patients who underwent brain surgery and experienced air build-up in their brain. Half of these patients were given pure oxygen for 3 hours while the other half simply breathed in normal room air. We performed scans on their brains just after the surgery and 24 hours afterwards. Without knowing who had received the oxygen treatment, we assessed the change in air volume in their brains and the air absorption rate 24 hours after the surgery. Our findings suggest that the air build-up reduced more in the patients who received the oxygen treatment. This effect was especially pronounced in patients who were above 52 years old. However, there was no significant difference in attention levels (measured by a test) between the two groups. The alertness level differed between the two groups, with the oxygen-treated patients had increased alertness.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe oxygen treatment administered through a tube after brain surgery is safe and effective in reducing air build-up in the brain. Older patients, especially men, benefit the most from this treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe experiment was officially logged with the German Clinical Trials Register.", "original_sentences":

If cervical ripening using a prostaglandin is required, a pre-labour overnight hospitalisation and separation from family and support companions is necessary. Recent evidence shows that balloon catheter cervical ripening is just as effective as prostaglandins, but does not cause uterine stimulation. For women with low risk pregnancies, this offers the possibility of undergoing the overnight ripening process in their own home. We conducted a pilot randomised trial to assess the outcomes, clinical pathways and acceptability to both women and clinicians of outpatient balloon catheter ripening compared with usual inpatient care.\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-eight women with low risk term pregnancies were randomised (2:1) to either outpatient (n = 33) or inpatient double-balloon catheter (n = 15) cervical ripening. Although not powered for statistically significant differences, the study explored potential direction of effect for key clinical outcomes such as oxytocin use, caesarean section and morbidities. Feedback on acceptability was sought from women at catheter insertion and 4 weeks after the birth, and from midwives and doctors, at the end of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nClinical and perinatal outcomes were similar. Most women required oxytocin (77 %). The outpatient group were 24 % less likely to require oxytocin (risk difference \u221223.6 %, 95 % CI \u221243.8 to \u22123.5). There were no failed inductions, infections or uterine hyperstimulation attributable to the catheter in either group. Most women in both groups reported discomfort with insertion and wearing the catheter, but were equally satisfied with their care and felt the baby was safe (91 % both groups). Outpatient women reported feeling less isolated or emotionally alone. Most midwives and doctors (n = 90) agreed that they are more comfortable in sending home a woman with a catheter than prostaglandins and 90 % supported offering outpatient ripening to eligible women.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient balloon catheter ripening should be further investigated as an option for women in an adequately powered randomised trial.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nProspectively registered, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612001184864.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nIn Australia, one out of four births are induced, or started artificially. Usually, this requires a woman to stay in a hospital overnight for a procedure involving a hormone called prostaglandin. However, new studies show that a balloon catheter, a tube with an inflatable section, can also be used for something called cervical ripening and is just as effective as prostaglandins. The bonus is that it doesn't cause stimulation of the womb. For low-risk pregnancies, this method allows women to have the procedure at home. We conducted an initial small-scale study to compare this at-home method with the usual in-hospital procedure in terms of results, how it's done, and how acceptable it is to both women and clinicians.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had 48 women with low-risk pregnancies take part in the study. Two thirds of them tried the at-home method while one third stayed in the hospital. We looked at a few key things, like whether labor-inducing drugs were needed, if a C-section was performed, and any health problems. We also got feedback on how acceptable this procedure was both from women and healthcare professionals.\n\nRESULTS.\nOutcomes for mother and baby were similar in both groups. Most women, 77%, needed labor-inducing drugs. However, the group at home was 24% less likely to need these drugs. There were no treatment failures, infections, or over-stimulation of the womb in either group. Most women reported discomfort with the balloon catheter but were equally satisfied overall. They felt their baby was safe and experienced less loneliness. Healthcare professionals were more comfortable with sending a woman home with a balloon catheter than prostaglandins, and most agreed they would offer the at-home method to eligible women.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe study suggests that, for inducing labor, the at-home method using a balloon catheter deserves further investigation. It should be studied in a larger, more accurate trial.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in advance at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.", "original_sentences":

distinct effects on the human body. However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection (group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P<0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Additionally, no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups (all P>0.05). The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P<0.05; E-selectin: P<0.05). The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P<0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P>0.05). Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P<0.001; E-selectin: P<0.05); however, the serum TNF-\u03b1 levels did not differ among groups (all P>0.05). Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C, there were no significant differences among groups (all P>0.05). In conclusion, we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion. Moreover, chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect, but there was no association between H. pylori infection, chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance.", "simplification": "We wanted to understand how long-term alcohol intake relates to a specific stomach infection caused by a bacteria called H. pylori. We studied various body responses and inflammation markers in three groups of people, totaling 142 subjects in all. Group A consisted of 59 people who drink alcohol regularly and have the H. pylori infection. Group B had 53 subjects who drink alcohol regularly but do not have the infection. Finally, Group C was the control group of 30 people who neither drink alcohol regularly nor are infected.\n\nBody mass index (BMI), a measure of body size based on height and weight, was generally higher in those who drank alcohol frequently whether infected with H. pylori or not. However, the difference in BMI wasn't significant between those who were infected and those who weren't.\n\nGenerally, certain substances that signify inflammation were different between the groups. For example, lower levels of two inflammation markers, IL-10 and E-selectin, were found in those who drank alcohol and were infected with H. pylori compared to those that weren't infected. Those who drank alcohol but weren't infected showed higher levels of these markers than the control group.\n\nHowever, the levels of another inflammation marker, TNF-\u03b1, were not very different among the groups. Levels of substances that signify cell damage were also not significantly different among the groups.\n\nTo sum it all up, we think that the H. pylori infection might weaken certain inflammation responses in those who drink alcohol regularly.

Forty trained male soccer players were randomly assigned to Asx and placebo groups. Asx group was supplemented with 4 mg of Asx. Saliva and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 90 days of supplementation in preexercise conditions. We observed a rise of sIgA levels at rest after 90 days of Asx supplementation, which was accompanied with a decrease in prooxidant-antioxidant balance. The plasma muscle enzymes levels were reduced significantly by Asx supplementation and by regular training. The increase in neutrophil count and hs-CRP level was found only in placebo group, indicating a significant blunting of the systemic inflammatory response in the subjects taking Asx. This study indicates that Asx supplementation improves sIgA response and attenuates muscle damage, thus preventing inflammation induced by rigorous physical training.

When one exercises, it creates stress that affects the immune system, causes oxidation, injures the muscles and creates inflammation. Our focus was on how this supplement affects saliva immune response (sIgA) and oxidative stress in the bloodstream. We also checked other biochemical measures and the number of different types of white blood cells.\n\nWe carried out our study on forty trained male soccer players, splitting them randomly into two groups; one group took the supplement and the other did not act as a comparison.\n\nWe collected saliva and blood samples, both before they started taking Asx and after 90 days of its usage while at rest. We noticed the levels of sIgA increased after 90 days of usage and also that there was a reduction in the oxidant-antioxidant balance. The supplement was found to significantly lower the levels of enzymes related to muscle damage. The rise in a certain type of white blood cells (neutrophil) count and inflammation (hs-CRP level), were only found in the group that did not take the supplement, which shows that Asx could help to control the body's inflammatory responses to intense exercise.\n\nIn conclusion, our study shows that using Asx can boost the immune response in the saliva and protect against muscle damage, helping the body deal with inflammation caused by intense, physical training. We also suggest further use of Asx in situations where the body has a weaker immune response, or when there are high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence":

haloperidol is known to be effective for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However, precise dose-response studies have not been completed, especially in patients at high risk for PONV who require combination therapy. This study sought to identify which dose of haloperidol 1mg or 2mg could be combined with dexamethasone without adverse effects in high-risk patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nFemale adults (n = 150) with three established PONV risk factors based on Apfel's score were randomized into one of three study groups. At the end of anesthesia, groups H0, H1, and H2 were given intravenous (IV) saline, haloperidol 1 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg, respectively. All patients were given dexamethasone 5 mg during the induction of anesthesia. The overall early (0\u20132 h) and late (2\u201324 h) incidences of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti-emetic administration, pain, and adverse effects (cardiac arrhythmias and extrapyramidal effects) were assessed postoperatively. The sedation score was recorded in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).\n\nRESULTS.\nThe total incidence of PONV over 24 h was significantly lower in groups H1 (29 %) and H2 (24 %) than in group H0 (54 %; P = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between groups H1 and H2. In the PACU, group H2 had a higher sedation score than groups H1 and H0 (P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFor high-risk PONV patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, when used with dexamethasone, 1-mg haloperidol was equally effective as 2 mg in terms of preventing PONV with the less sedative effect.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01639599).", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looked at the best dosage of a drug called haloperidol to use in combination with another drug, dexamethasone, to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery. The focus was on people who were at high risk of nausea and vomiting, specifically women having keyhole surgery on their reproductive organs.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study involved 150 adult women who had a high risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. They were divided into three groups. At the end of the anesthesia, the first group was given a harmless saline solution, the second group was given 1 mg of haloperidol, and the third group was given 2 mg of haloperidol. Everyone was given 5 mg of dexamethasone when they were first put to sleep for the surgery. The researchers then kept track of nausea, vomiting, use of other medicines to stop vomiting, pain, and side effects in the next 24 hours. They also assessed how sleepy the patients were after the surgery in the recovery room.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall, fewer people felt sick or vomited in the 24 hours after surgery in the groups given haloperidol (29% in the 1 mg group and 24% in the 2 mg group) compared to the group given saline (54%). But there was no difference in results between the 1 mg and 2 mg haloperidol groups. The people given 2 mg of haloperidol were sleepier than the others after the surgery.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFor women having keyhole surgery on their reproductive organs who are at high risk of feeling sick or vomiting after surgery, 1 mg of haloperidol worked just as well as 2 mg in preventing these issues when used with dexamethasone. Plus, they didn't get as sleepy with the 1 mg dose.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the code NCT01639599.\n", "original_sentences": [{"sentence":

protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children <24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (\u22120.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (\u22120.20 to 0.63) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIt is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDutch Trial Register NTR2334.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nBabies who have heart surgery may not get enough protein. This is because having surgery and using a heart-lung machine during the operation might break down protein faster than normal, and these babies might not eat enough to replace it. This study was done to see how giving these babies more protein after surgery would affect their protein levels.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a study where we randomly chose some babies to get a lot of protein and some to get a normal amount. This was done on the second day after they had surgery to fix heart defects they were born with. We did a special test to measure how much of a kind of protein called \"valine\" their bodies were making. We also measured how much of another protein called \"albumin\" their bodies were making. We then compared the results between the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\n28 babies, who were around 9 months old and weighed about 7 kg, took part in the study. However, we could only use the data from 20 of them for our final results. Because we didn't have enough data, we couldn't make conclusions about protein levels. There was no difference in albumin production between the two groups. However, we saw that the babies getting a lot of protein had higher levels of valine and another substance called BUN, which is an indicator of how much protein a person is getting.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIt looks like the extra protein in the diet of the high-protein group might have increased the levels of valine and BUN. However, because we didn't have enough data, we can't say for sure that a high-protein diet would change protein levels in these babies. Therefore, the results from our study should be taken as a starting point for further research.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered with the Dutch Trial Register (NTR2334).",

This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (RCT) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6\u201317 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (MMN) including zinc (451 in each group). The supplementation period for both groups was six months. In 2012, a subsample of 184 children from the original cohort (now aged 36\u201348 months) was randomly selected to participate in a follow-up trial and was assessed for intelligence, working memory, inhibition, and executive function. The tests showed no significant differences between the supplementation groups though there were some gender differences, with girls displaying higher scores than boys across both groups on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) Verbal IQ sentences subtest, the Day-Night cognitive test and on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) social competency, and boys scoring higher than girls in problem behaviour.

Half of them got a supplement that was just iron, while the other half got a supplement that included iron plus some other nutrients, like zinc. They did this for six months.\n\nTwo years later, they got a random group of 184 kids from the original set to take part in another round of tests. They tested their intelligence, memory, and other brain functions, as well as their social-emotional skills. \n\nThe results showed that the type of supplement they had as babies didn't make a difference in these areas. However, there was a noticeable difference between boys and girls. For example, girls generally had higher scores in verbal intelligence and social skills, while boys had higher scores in problem behaviour. \n\nThese findings mean that giving extra nutrients beyond iron did not make a difference to these children's cognitive function in the long term.

postprandial muscle protein synthesis (MPS): anabolic resistance. Knowing that resistance exercise (RT) can enhance MPS, we examined whether RT could enhance MPS following 2 weeks of SR. In addition, as we postulated that SR may impair feeding-induced vasodilation limiting nutrient delivery to muscle, we also examined whether citrulline (CIT), as an arginine and nitric oxide precursor, could attenuate muscle anabolic resistance accompanying SR. We used a unilateral leg model to compare older subjects' who had undergone SR to a loaded condition of SR plus RT (SR + RT). Thirty older men (70 \u00b1 1 years) underwent 14 days of SR (<1500 steps/day) with supplementation of either 5 g/day CIT or glycine placebo. Throughout SR, subjects performed unilateral low-load RT thrice weekly. We assessed muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive and postprandial state (20 g whey isolate plus 15 g glycine or as micellar-whey with 5 g CIT or 15 g glycine, n = 10/group). As MPS was similar after ingestion of either whey isolate, micellar-whey, or micellar-whey + CIT data related to different dietary groups were collapsed to compare SR and SR + RT legs. Subjects' daily steps were reduced by 80 \u00b1 2% during SR (P < 0.001) compared with baseline. Leg fat-free mass decreased with SR (\u2212124 \u00b1 61 g) and increased in the SR + RT (+126 \u00b1 68 g; P = 0.003). Myofibrillar FSR was lower (P < 0.0001) in the SR as compared with the SR + RT leg in the postabsorptive (0.026 \u00b1 0.001%/h vs. 0.045 \u00b1 0.001%/h) and postprandial states (0.055 \u00b1 0.002%/h vs. 0.115 \u00b1 0.003%/h).

The researchers wanted to know if doing resistance exercises (like lifting weights) could help boost this protein creation process, especially after a period of reduced activity. They also wondered if consuming citrulline (a substance that helps widen blood vessels) could counteract the negative impact of less movement by improving nutrient delivery to the muscles.\n\n30 older men (around 70 years old) were asked to reduce their daily steps to less than 1500 for two weeks. They were given either citrulline or a placebo (a substance with no effect), and did light resistance exercise with one of their legs. After the two weeks, the researchers checked the protein creation in their muscles both before and after meals, using different protein supplements.\n\nThe results showed that doing resistance exercise helped curb the negative effects of taking fewer steps, such as muscle loss, and improved the protein creation process after meals. However, taking citrulline didn't have any significant effect. The study suggests that resistance exercise can help older adults maintain healthy muscles, even if they are less active.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "Step-reduction (SR) in older adults

exploring the effect of patient empowerment on short- and long-term outcomes after major oncologic surgery in elderly cancer patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis trial was performed from February 2011 to January 2014 at two tertiary medical centers in Germany. The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 \u00b1 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7\u201314 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPatient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicaltrials.gov. Identifier NCT01278537", "simplification": "PURPOSE.\nThis research was designed to see if educating older cancer patients about their surgery would affect their recovery time or their health and quality of life one year after their procedure.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween February 2011 and January 2014, the research took place in two major medical centers in Germany. We had patients who were 65 years or older who were getting surgery for stomach, urinary, and chest cancer. We randomly put these patients into two groups. One group received an information booklet and kept a diary\u2014a way to give more power to the patient. The other group was given the usual care. We measured how long they had to stay in the hospital after their surgery and their health and life quality after a year. We also looked at their stress and any complications after surgery. Lastly, we wanted to identify any factors that could predict their hospital stay and life quality at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had 652 patients with an average age of around 72, and most were men. On average, patients stayed in the hospital for 9 days after their surgery. There wasn't a significant difference in hospital stay or life quality after a year between the two groups. While three out of four people had some kind of complication after the surgery, the frequency and severity were the same in both groups. However, those who received the information booklet and kept a diary reported having less pain after their surgery. The factors that determined how long patients stayed in the hospital were how severe the surgery was, how long the anesthesia lasted, any major complications after surgery, a patient's nutrition level, and their physical ability before surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nGiving patients more information about their surgery and having them keep a diary did not shorten their hospital stay. However, it did result in less reported pain after surgery. How long a patient had to stay in the hospital was determined by their nutrition level, physical ability, the severity of the surgery, and how long the anesthesia lasted.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis

However, the stride parameters emerging from such an analysis have never been used to design a training protocol aimed at increasing stride length. With this aim, we investigated the effects of stride frequency manipulation during three weeks of uphill (2%) training on stride length at iso-efficiency speed. Twelve male race walkers were randomly allocated to one of two training groups: stride frequency manipulation (RWM, n=6) and free stride frequency (RWF, n=6). Results. Kinematic parameters measured before and after the 3-week training in RWM showed increased stride length (4.54%; p<0.0001) and contact time (4.58%; p<0.001); inversely, a decreased stride frequency (4.44%; p<0.0001) and internal work (7.09%; p<0.05) were found. In RWF the effect of the training showed a decrease in stride length (1.18%; p<0.0001) and contact time (<1%; p<0.0001) with respect to baseline conditions and an increased stride frequency and internal work of 1.19% (p<0.0001).

For each separate aspect of recovery, over 80% of the Superion\u00ae patients showed improvements.

The teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 25 each (n=25). In groups 1, 2 and 3 the teeth were prepared using Mtwo, PTU and RCP, respectively. While in group 4 (control group) the samples were left unprepared. After preparation, all specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of root at 3, 5 and 9-mm distances from the apex. The sections were then individually observed under 12\u00d7 magnification using stereomicroscope. The data was analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. The level of significance was set at 0.05.\n\nRESULTS.\nNo cracks were observed in the control group. All engine-driven systems caused dentinal cracks. Mtwo and PTU caused cracks significantly more than RCP (P<0.05).

After these treatments, parts of the teeth were cut and examined under a microscope. The gathered data was then statistically analysed.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe control group of untreated teeth showed no cracks. All the treatment methods caused some cracks. Two of the tools, Mtwo and ProTaper Universal, caused significantly more cracks than the third tool, Reciproc which didn't cause significantly more cracks than the untreated group. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nAll three treatment methods caused some dental damage.

unclear owing to its limited geographic distribution. Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS.\nTreatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon \u03b1-2a (180 \u03bcg/week) and ribavirin (800\u20131,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group. The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention-to-treat analysis were 90.8% (69/76) and 88.2% (67/76), respectively; those in the per-protocol analysis were 95.7% (67/70) and 97.0% (64/66), respectively. More patients in the 48-week group had anemia (46.1% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.03), but other adverse events were comparable between the groups. The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nTwenty-four weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy was non-inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01263860", "simplification": "GOAL:\nWe aim to find the best treatment for a specific type of hepatitis C (a liver disease) that is mainly found in certain geographic areas. We decided to test two different lengths of treatment - 24 weeks and 48 weeks - using a combination of two drugs. This test was done on patients in Southern China.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\nWe gave the drug combination to people with this type of hepatitis C who had never received treatment for it before. After four weeks, the people who were showing signs of improvement were split into two groups. One group received 20 more weeks of treatment and the other got 44 more weeks of treatment. The main thing we were watching for was the effectiveness of the treatment. Over the course of three years, we found that about 72% of the patients showed an improvement. Both groups had roughly the same success rate. However, we noticed more patients in the longer-term treatment group had anemia (low iron levels in the blood), though other negative side effects were about the same. One downfall to this study was that we only included people from Southern China, so the results may not apply to everyone.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe shorter 24-week treatment worked just as well as the 48-week treatment in these patients. So, for those patients who reacted positively to the treatment at the four-week mark, 24-weeks of treatment may be just as good if not better due to less chance of developing anemia.\n\nTRIAL

The World Health Organization self-reported QOL questionnaire (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental factors) was used to assess the QOL. Student's t-test was used to compare the differences in a mean and change from baseline VO2 max levels, whereas Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess changes in QOL scores from baseline in the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was a greater increase from baseline (P < 0.0001) in the mean VO2 max with KSM-66 Ashwagandha (n = 24) compared to placebo (n = 25) at 8 weeks (4.91 and 1.42, respectively) and at 12 weeks (5.67 and 1.86 respectively). The QOL scores for all subdomains significantly improved to a greater extent in the Ashwagandha group at 12 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe findings suggest that Ashwagandha root extract enhances the cardiorespiratory endurance and improves QOL in healthy athletic adults.", "simplification": "INTRODUCTION.\nAshwagandha is a plant that has been traditionally used for a variety of health benefits. These benefits include increasing energy, improving the immune system, and aiding both male and female fertility. Clinical studies are continuing to explore the benefits of Ashwagandha, particularly in improving cardiovascular health and physical performance.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY.\nThis study focused on finding out if Ashwagandha root extract can improve cardiovascular fitness and quality of life in 50 healthy athletic adults (both men and women). It involved comparing the effects of Ashwagandha and a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect).\n\nMETHOD.\nTo measure cardiovascular fitness, we tested how much oxygen the subjects used during a physical exercise test. We also used a questionnaire by the World Health Organization to measure the subjects' quality of life, including physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe use of the Ashwagandha root extract showed a significant improvement in the subjects' cardiovascular fitness over the 8 and 12-week periods, compared to the placebo group. Additionally, the quality of life scores improved more for the group taking Ashwagandha than the group on the placebo, across all categories.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study suggests that Ashwagandha root

We examined engagement generated by content based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) in a motivationally tailored smoking cessation intervention on Facebook.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study aimed to identify which intervention content based on the TTM (Decisional Balance and 10 processes of change) generated the highest engagement among participants in pre-action stages of change (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation).\n\nMETHODS.\nParticipants (N=79, 20% female, mean age 20.8) were assessed for readiness to quit smoking and assigned to one of 7 secret Facebook groups tailored to their stage of change. Daily postings to the groups based on TTM Decisional Balance and the 10 processes of change were made by research staff over 3 months. Engagement was operationalized as the number of participant comments to each post. TTM content-based predictors of number of comments were analyzed and stratified by baseline stage of change, using negative binomial regression analyses with and without zero inflation.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 512 TTM-based posts generated 630 individual comments. In Precontemplation and Contemplation groups, Decisional Balance posts generated above average engagement (P=.01 and P<.001). In Contemplation groups, posts based on the TTM processes Dramatic Relief and Self-Liberation resulted in below average engagement (P=.01 and P=.005). In Preparation groups, posts based on Consciousness Raising generated above average engagement (P=.009). Participant engagement decreased over time and differed between groups within Precontemplation and Contemplation stages, but was independent of day of the week and time of day the content was posted to the groups. No participant baseline characteristics significantly predicted engagement.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParticipants not ready to quit in the next 30 days (in Precontemplation or Contemplation) engaged most when prompted to think about the pros and cons of behavior change, while those in the Preparation stage engaged most when posts increased awareness about smoking and smoking cessation. Findings support tailoring intervention content to readiness to quit and suggest intervention components that may be most effective in generating high participant engagement on social media.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at how social media can be used to encourage young adults to quit smoking. Previous attempts to change people's behavior - like quitting smoking - through social media haven't been very successful because people didn't really engage with them. We're trying a new approach in this study, using a model that helps people to change their behavior and creating content on Facebook that suits each person's willingness to quit.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe aim of the study is to find out which content, based on this behavioral change model, gets the most responses from people who are thinking about quitting smoking, but haven't started the process yet.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe involved 79 people who smoke in the study (mostly men, with an average age of around 21 years old). They were assessed to find out how ready they were to quit smoking, then put into one of 7 private Facebook groups. These groups were tailored to their readiness to quit. A member of the research team would post daily content matching their readiness level for three months. We measured the success of the posts by how many comments they got.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe 512 posts got a total of 630 comments. For those who weren't planning on quitting within the month, posts asking them to weigh the pros and cons of changing their behavior got the most comments. For people who were getting ready to quit, posts raising awareness about smoking issues got the most comments. No matter what time or day the posts were published, the engagement levels dropped over time and varied between the different groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParticipants who weren't planning to quit anytime soon engaged the most with posts asking them to think about the good and bad sides of changing their behavior. Those getting ready to quit liked posts about facts related to smoking and how to quit. This supports the idea of using material based on how ready someone is to quit smoking. Certain types of content seem to work better in getting people engaged on social media.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Social

is still a lack of consensus regarding the use of minimally invasive surgical technique (MIS) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective, randomized, international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer-assisted TKA (CAS-TKA) using either mini-midvastus (MIS group) or standard medial parapatellar approach (conventional group).  Patients from 3 centers (Maastricht, Zwickau, Adelaide) with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS-TKA without patella resurfacing. The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery, blood loss, chair rise test, quadriceps strength, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS),WOMAC scores, mechanical leg axis and component alignment.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients in the MIS group (3.97 \u00b1 2.16) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group (2.77 \u00b1 1.43) p = 0.003. There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters. Surgery time was significantly longer (p < 0.001) and there were significantly higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group. The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant (\u20130.43\u00b0 (95 % CI \u20131.50 \u2013 0.64); p = 0.43).  There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment (p = 0.778) or posterior slope (p = 0.164) of the tibial component.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThere was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS-TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed, however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss. MIS-TKA in combination with computer navigation is safe in terms of implant positioning.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625311 8 December 2015", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThough some studies suggest that less invasive surgeries are the better way to perform total knee replacements (TKA), professionals can't completely agree on this.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe selected 69 patients seeking treatment for severe knee pain at three international hospitals to participate in a trial. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group received the less invasive surgery (MIS); the other received the standard surgery. Both surgeries were aided by a computer system (CAS-TKA), but did not include resurfacing of the kneecap.\n\nOur main goal was to compare pain and flexibility after surgery between the two groups. We also recorded other measurements like the length of surgery, blood loss, time it took to rise from a chair, strength, knee pain, knee scores, and leg alignment measurements.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwo weeks after surgery, patients who had the less invasive procedure reported significantly more pain than those who had the standard procedure. Additionally, surgeries were longer and involved more blood loss in the less invasive group. However, there was no significant difference in flexibility or leg alignment between the two groups.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings indicate that the standard surgery may have some advantages over the less invasive technique, such as shorter surgery time and less blood loss. Nevertheless, the less invasive technique seems to be safe when it comes to implant placement. \n\nThe trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on December 8, 2015 with the number NCT02625311.",

In this study, the benefit of preoperative nutritional support was investigated for non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent anatomic resection.\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective study was planned with the approval of our institutional review board. Fifty-eight patients who underwent anatomic resection in our department between January 2014 and December 2014 were randomized. Thirty-one patients were applied a preoperative nutrition program with immune modulating formulae (enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids and nucleotides) for ten days. There were 27 patients in the control group who were fed with only normal diet. Patients who were malnourished, diabetic or who had undergone bronchoplastic procedures or neoadjuvant therapy were excluded from the study. Patients\u2019 baseline serum albumin levels, defined as the serum albumin level before any nutrition program, and the serum albumin levels on the postoperative third day were calculated and recorded with the other data.\n\nRESULTS.\nAnatomic resection was performed by thoracotomy in 20 patients, and 11 patients were operated by videothoracoscopy in the nutrition program group. On the other hand 16 patients were operated by thoracotomy and 11 patients were operated by videothoracoscopy in the control group.

We divided these patients randomly into two groups. The first group, 31 patients, followed a special diet for ten days before their surgery. This diet included specific nutrients known to boost the immune system. The second group, 27 patients, ate their regular meals. We didn\u2019t include patients who were already not eating well, had diabetes, or had received other treatments for their lung cancer. We measured levels of a protein in their blood before they started the special diet and again three days after their surgery. We also recorded other data, like if they had any problems after the surgery and how long a chest drain needed to stay in after the surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe did the surgery in two different ways in both groups, either opening up the chest or using a video camera to guide the surgery. The patients who didn't have the special diet saw a larger drop in their blood protein levels three days after the surgery. In this group, about 44% of patients had problems after their surgery compared to 19% in the special diet group.

for patients with acute cerebral infarction has a certain effect. Although there are several proposed mechanisms of drug action, no related research on improving the inflammatory cytokines that regulate the body\u2019s immune system through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis has been published.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nTo determine the impact of butylphthalide and sodium chloride injection on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after acute cerebral infarction in the basal ganglia.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients were randomly divided into treatment and control groups; the treatment group received intravenous drips of butylphthalide, while the control group did not. The levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (COR), along with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of both groups were detected using the radioimmunoassay method. This was done at regular intervals after cerebral infarction in the basal ganglia was detected.\n\nRESULTS.\nFourteen days after treatment, the levels of serum ACTH and COR in both groups were higher than normal. The NIHSS score and levels of ACTH and COR of the treatment group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p<0.05). The data was computed and analyzed using SPSS17.0 software.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nButylphthalide treatment for patients suffering from acute basal ganglia infarction can reduce the adverse effects on the HPA axis, thus improving patient prognosis.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nWe know that a medicine called butylphthalide sodium chloride injection can help people who've just had a certain type of stroke, but we don't know exactly how it works. We think it might help reduce inflammation and boost the immune system by affecting a particular group of glands in the body (the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands).\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nWe want to see what effect this medicine has on these glands when given to people who've just had this type of stroke.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe split patients into two groups: one got the medicine through an IV drip and the other didn't. We then measured their hormone levels and used a standard test to check on their stroke symptoms. We did this a few times after they had the stroke.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter two weeks, we found that both groups had higher than normal levels of two specific hormones. However, the group who got the medicine had lower levels of these hormones and better scores on the stroke test than the group who didn't get the medicine.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nGiving this medicine to

Nevertheless, breastfeeding rates remain low despite public health efforts. Our study aims to investigate the effect of controlled limited formula usage during birth hospitalisation on breastfeeding, using the primary hypothesis that early limited formula feeds in infants with early weight loss will not adversely affect the rate of exclusive or any breastfeeding as measured at discharge, 3 and 6 months of age.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nWe randomly assigned 104 healthy term infants, 24 to 48 hours old, with \u2265 5% loss of birth weight to controlled limited formula (CLF) intervention (10 ml formula by syringe after each breastfeeding, discontinued at onset of lactation) or control group (standard approach, SA). Groups were compared for demographic data and breastfeeding rates at discharge, 3 months and 6 months of age (p-values adjusted for multiple testing).\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty newborns were analysed in CLF and 50 in SA group. There were no differences in demographic data or clinical characteristics between groups. We found no evidence of difference between treatment groups in the rates of exclusive as well as any breastfeeding at discharge (p-value 0.2 and >0.99 respectively), 3 months (p-value 0.12 and 0.10) and 6 months of infants\u2019 age (p-value 0.45 and 0.34 respectively). The percentage weight loss during hospitalisation was significantly higher in the SA group (7.3% in CLF group, 8.4% in SA group, p = 0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study shows that controlled limited formula use does not have an adverse effect on rates of breastfeeding in the short and long term. Larger studies are needed to confirm a possible potential in controlled limited formula use to support establishing breastfeeding and to help to improve the rates of breastfeeding overall.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nISRCTN registry ISRCTN61915183", "simplification": "GOAL OF THE STUDY.\nBreastfeeding is good for a baby's health and overall wellbeing-- but not enough women do it. We wanted to see if giving newborns a small amount of baby formula right after birth would hurt or help breastfeeding rates. We also wanted to know whether this approach would hinder breastfeeding when the baby is three or six months old.\n\nHOW THE STUDY WAS DONE.\nWe picked 104 healthy babies that had lost more than 5% of their birth weight and were between one and two days old. We split them into two groups. In one group, we gave the babies 10 ml of baby formula feed after each breastfeeding session (this was stopped as soon as the mother's milk came in). The other group followed the standard approach. We tracked breastfeeding rates when the babies left the hospital, and then checked in when they were three and six months old.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nIn both groups, 50 newborns were examined. The groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical characteristics. There was no noticeable difference in breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge, at three months, or at six months between the two groups. One thing that did differ, was the amount of weight the babies lost in the hospital - babies in the standard approach lost more weight.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS.\nOur study shows that giving newborns a small amount of baby formula feed doesn't seem to hurt breastfeeding rates in the short or long term. More studies need to be done to see if this approach can help more moms breastfeed and keep breastfeeding for longer.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS.\nThe study is registered with the ISRCTN under the

The first group (Group A) signed the hospital's standard Consent for Operation form only while the second group (Group B) signed a separate Consent for Anesthesia form additionally. Patients were interviewed postoperatively with an eight-item questionnaire with responses in a 5-point Likert scale. A composite adequacy of consent index was generated from the responses and analyzed.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwo hundred patients (100 in each group) were studied. All patients indicated that the anesthesiologist(s) had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The mean adequacy of consent index score in Group B was higher than that of Group A (30.6 \u00b1 4.6 [standard deviation (SD)] vs. 27.9 \u00b1 5.2 [SD]) (P < 0.001). The separate written consent had a positive impact on the patients' understanding of the nature and purpose of the intended anesthesia procedures (P = 0.04), satisfaction with the adequacy of information provided about common side effects (P < 0.001) and rare but serious complications (P = 0.008).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nA separate written consent for anesthesia improved the efficacy of the informed consent process with respect to better information about the nature and purpose of anesthesia, common side effects, and rare but serious complications.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS.\nThis study aimed to see if handing out a separate permission form for anesthesia helps patients understand the anesthetic procedures better.

The first group (Group A) signed the standard hospital permission form for surgery, while the second group (Group B) signed an extra form specifically for anesthesia. After the surgery, we asked the patients a series of questions to find out how well they understood the anesthesia process. We then studied the answers to reach a conclusion.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe collected data from two hundred patients, with one hundred in each group. All patients agreed that the anesthesiologist had their permission to proceed with their anesthesia care. The average score showing how well the consent process worked in Group B (who got the extra form) was higher than that of Group A. The separate written form helped the patients understand the whole anesthesia process better, including common side effects and potential serious complications.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nHanding out a separate permission form for anesthesia makes the consent process better.

But there are problems with this. Sometimes, the stent can become clogged up and need to be removed, which can lead to pain, infection, and other complications. This study is trying to find a better way to use the stent to avoid these problems.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nWe looked at 90 patients who were going to have a kidney transplant within a year. We split them into two groups. In one group, the stent was attached to a catheter. In the other group, the stent was used in the standard way, separate from the catheter. We then compared rates of infection, how often the stent got blocked, and how bad any urinary symptoms were between the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter two and four weeks, fewer patients in the group where the stent was attached to the catheter had an infection compared to the standard group. Overall, urinary leakage was slight, but it only happened in the standard group. Stent blockage only happened in the standard group too.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAlthough the differences between the two groups weren't big enough to be statistically significant, the group where the stent was attached to the catheter had fewer complications.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), fatigue is rated as one of the most common and disabling symptoms. In the present trial, we investigated the effect of A. paniculata on relapse rate and fatigue in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients receiving interferon beta.\n\nMETHODS.\nA randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects of 170 mg of A. paniculata dried extract tablet b.i.d. p.o. on relapse rate and fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scores (FSS) over 12 months in RRMS patients receiving interferon. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, inflammatory parameters and radiological findings were also investigated. Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and twenty-two patients were ultimately analysed and randomised to the active or placebo group.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients treated with A. paniculata showed a significant reduction in their FSS score as compared to the placebo, equivalent to a 44 % reduction at 12 months. No statistically significant differences were observed for relapse rate, EDSS or inflammatory parameters, with a trend in reducing new lesions among the A. paniculata group. One patient in the A. paniculata group presented with a mild and transient skin rash, which was alleviated with anti-histamine treatment for three weeks.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nA. paniculata was well tolerated in patients and no changes in clinical parameters were observed. A. paniculata significantly reduces fatigue in patients with RRMS receiving interferon beta in comparison to placebo and only interferon beta treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02280876; Trial registration date: 20.10.2014.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nAndrographis paniculata (A. paniculata), a medicinal plant, has shown potential benefits in treating inflammation, nerve damage, and scarring in experiments involving animals. It is also known to be effective in reducing fatigue in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Fatigue is a common symptom in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. We conducted a study to see if A. paniculata could help reduce fatigue and the recurrence of symptoms in MS patients who are already taking a drug called interferon beta.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a blind study\u2014meaning neither the patients nor the researchers knew who was receiving what treatment\u2014where we gave MS patients who were already taking a drug called interferon beta either a 170 mg tablet of A. paniculata extract or a sugar pill twice a day for a year. We then monitored them for instances where their symptoms came back and gauged their fatigue levels. We also performed tests to measure disability, inflammation, and to check for changes in the brain. We initially selected 25 patients, but 3 dropped out, so we ended with information on 22 patients.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients who were given the A. paniculata extract experienced a significant decrease in fatigue when compared to those who received the sugar pill. This reduction was by almost half over the course of a year. There were no significant changes in the recurrence of symptoms, disability, or inflammation in either group. The group that took A. paniculata showed signs of having fewer new brain lesions. One patient taking A. paniculata did develop a mild, temporary skin rash, but this went away after three weeks of taking an allergy medication.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe A. paniculata extract was well received by patients and caused no noticeable changes in their clinical examinations. The extract notably reduced fatigue in MS patients who are already taking interferon beta compared to those who took only the sugar pill and the drug.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis clinical trial was

There were no significant difference between groups regarding baseline characteristics. Remifentanil group had lower duration of procedure (2.5 \u00b1 1.6 versus 4.6 \u00b1 1.8 minutes, p < 0.001), higher pain reduction (53.7 \u00b1 13.3 versus 33.5 \u00b1 19.6, p < 0.001), lower failure rate (1 (2.1%) versus 15 (31.3%), p < 0.001), higher satisfaction (p = 0.005).

They compared things like speed of the procedure, patient satisfaction and any problems that occurred between the two different pain relief methods.\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 96 people in the study, there was no significant difference in the characteristics of each group. The group that received remifentanil found the procedure to be quicker, more successful at managing pain, and more satisfactory compared to the fentanyl/midazolam group.

This study evaluated safety and efficacy of a combination approach of chemotherapy followed by chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) +/\u2212 cetuximab, and the prognostic role of miR-21 in patients with LAPC treated with a multimodality approach.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThis was a randomised phase II trial in which patients with inoperable LAPC were offered gemcitabine and capecitabine (GEM-CAP) for 16 weeks. Patients with stable disease or response after GEM-CAP were randomised to capecitabine or UFT plus radiotherapy (RT) (A), or capecitabine or UFT plus cetuximab plus RT (B). The primary outcome of the study was overall survival (OS). Clinical outcome was compared according to baseline circulating miR-21 levels.\n\nRESULTS.\n17 patients were enrolled and treated with GEM-CAP, with 13 patients achieving disease control and being randomised to arms A (n:7) and B (n:6). After a median follow-up of 61.2 months, median progression free survival (PFS) was 10.4 months and 12.7 months, median OS was 15.8 months and 22.0 months in arms A and B respectively (p > 0.05). Patients with high baseline plasma miR-21 had worse PFS (3.5 vs. 12.7 months; p:0.032) and OS (5.1 vs 15.3 months; p:0.5) compared to patients with low miR-21. Circulating miR-21 levels reflected miR-21 expression within the tissues.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAddition of Cetuximab to CRT following induction chemotherapy did not improve survival. High miR-21 baseline plasma expression was associated with poor clinical outcome in LAPC patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemo-radiotherapy.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis research focused on a type of pancreatic cancer that is hard to treat and often results in death. Specifically, it tested if a combined treatment of chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy with or without an extra drug called cetuximab would help. It also checked if a biomarker (something in your body that can be measured to show the presence of disease), called miR-21, could predict how patients would respond to the treatment.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nIn this trial, patients who couldn't undergo surgery for their pancreatic cancer were given a specific combination of drugs for 16 weeks. Only patients whose cancer didn't worsen or even improved after this initial treatment were then given another drug either with or without cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy. The key measure of success was overall survival rate. They also compared people's response to the treatment based on their levels of the biomarker miR-21.\n\nRESULTS.\n17 patients took the initial drugs, and 13 of them improved enough to receive the extra treatments. After about 5 years, they recorded how long it took for patients' cancers to get worse and how long the patients lived overall. They didn't see a big difference whether patients received the extra drug cetuximab or not. They did find that patients with high levels of the biomarker miR-21 generally did worse compared to those with lower levels, in terms of both how quickly their cancer got worse and how long they lived.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAdding cetuximab to the chemo-radiotherapy after the initial combination drug treatment didn't seem to improve survival rates. Having a high level of the miR-21 biomarker at the start was linked to patients faring worse. This suggests it might be a useful predictor for this particular combination treatment for this type of hard-to-treat pancreatic cancer.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start":

Every\u20104\u2010weeks dosing of alirocumab may be appropriate for some patients in absence of background statin but is not yet approved.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nLow\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), PCSK9, and alirocumab levels were assessed in subjects (LDL\u2010C >130 mg/dL, n=24/group) after a 4\u2010week run\u2010in taking oral ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or ezetimibe placebo, when alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (days 1, 29, and 57) was added.

The oral lipid\u2010lowering therapies appear to increase PCSK9 levels, leading to increased alirocumab clearance. Although the duration of effect was modestly diminished with alirocumab plus ezetimibe/fenofibrate versus placebo, the effect was less than observed in trials with background statins, and it would not preclude the use of alirocumab every 4 weeks in patients taking these nonstatin lipid\u2010lowering therapies concomitantly.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study investigates alirocumab, a drug used to lower cholesterol levels in the body.

Also, how the effects of alirocumab last was assessed. They gave alirocumab to people for 4 weeks combined with other substances. The results showed that alirocumab helped in reducing cholesterol levels in the body, the decreases lifted over time, particularly when alirocumab was used with fenofibrate and ezetimibe.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOverall, alirocumab was effective in reducing cholesterol when used alone or with other cholesterol-reducing substances.

We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.\n\nRESULTS. \nThe treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nSo, we conclude that using aDBS on both sides of the brain improves certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It's also able to adjust to the need for stimulation in patients taking medication.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.", "start": 0, "end": 26, "facts": []},

The units of randomisation were primary school classes recruited in May 2010. Eligible participants were Year 3 primary school classes in Lower Austria that had not participated in a similar programme during the last two years. After baseline assessment in September 2010, 53 classes from 45 primary schools in Lower Austria were randomly assigned to an intervention (n\u2009=\u200926 classes, 432 children) or waiting control arm (n\u2009=\u200927 classes, 493 children aged 8.7\u00a0years +/- 4\u00a0months). Over the course of 1.5 academic years, participating teachers received on-the-job training (20\u00a0h) and two workshops (8\u00a0h) to promote health related behaviour in students such as physical activity during the school day and to improve the quality of regular physical education classes. We assessed 15 outcomes grouped into five categories: Emotional and Social Experience in School, Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance measured by validated and standardised questionnaire and Motor Skills measured by validated and standardised motoric and coordination tests in the school gym. The primary outcome was Classroom Climate and part of the outcomecategory Emotional and Social Experience in School. The final assessment took place in April 2012. All assessors were blinded to the allocation of classes. Multilevel growth modelling was used to investigate programme effectiveness.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe could not detect any statistically significant differences between groups for the outcomecategories Emotional and Social Experience in school (p\u2009=\u20090.22 to 0.78), Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance. Significant differences between groups were limited to the outcomecategory Motor Skills (Complex Reaction Ability, Spatial Orientation Skills, Coordination with Precision) which were higher in the intervention group (P\u2009<\u2009.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nDespite small statistically significant differences in Motor Skills, our study could not detect any clinically relevant improvements in the Emotional and Social Experience at School (including the primary outcome ClassroomClimate), Physical Activity, Well-being, Motor Skills and Attention Performance of students.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nGerman register of clinical studies: DRKS00000622.

We picked 53 classes from 45 schools and divided them into two groups. One group used the program right away (432 children) and the other group waited to start the program (493 children). We checked how things were in September 2010 before the program started. Then, teachers in the first group were trained to promote healthy behaviors like exercising during the day and running better gym classes. After one and a half school years, we checked 15 different things grouped into five categories: 1. Feelings and social activities in school, 2. Physical activity, 3. Well-being, 4. Concentration, and 5. Physical skills measured in gym class. The main thing we wanted to learn was about the classroom atmosphere. We repeated the checks in April 2012.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe data did not show a big difference between the two groups in feelings and social activities at school, physical activity, well-being, and concentration. There was a noticeable difference only in physical skills, where the group that received the program performed a bit better.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEven though the children who participated in the program

worker in-service training approaches: 1) an off-site classroom-based integrated management of infectious diseases (IMID) course with distance learning aspects, and 2) on-site support (OSS), an educational outreach intervention. We tested the effects of OSS on workload and 12 facility performance indicators for emergency triage assessment and treatment, HIV testing, and malaria and pneumonia case management among outpatients by two subgroups: 1) mid-level practitioners (MLP) who attended IMID training (IMID-MLP) and 2) health workers who did not (No-IMID).\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-six health facilities participated in the IDCAP trial, with 18 randomly assigned to Arm A and 18 to Arm B. Two MLP in both arms received IMID. All providers at Arm A facilities received nine monthly OSS visits from April to December 2010 while Arm B did not. From November 2009 to December 2010, 777,667 outpatient visits occurred. We analyzed 669,580 (86.1 %) outpatient visits, where provider cadre was reported. Treatment was provided by 64 IMID-MLP and 1,515 No-IMID providers. The effect of OSS was measured by the difference in pre/post changes across arms after controlling for covariates (adjusted ratio of relative risks = a RRR).\n\nRESULTS.\nThe effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among IMID-MLP (aRRR = 1.21; p = 0.48) and No-IMID (aRRR = 0.90; p = 0.44) was not statistically significant. Among IMID-MLP, OSS was effective for three indicators: malaria cases receiving an appropriate antimalarial (aRRR = 1.26, 99 % CI = 1.02-1.56), patients with negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial (aRRR = 0.49, 99 % CI = 0.26-0.92), and patients with acid-fast bacilli smear negative result receiving empiric treatment for acute respiratory infection (aRRR = 2.04, 99 % CI = 1.06-3.94). Among No-IMID, OSS was effective for two indicators: emergency and priority patients admitted, detained or referred (aRRR = 2.12, 99 % CI = 1.05-4.28) and emergency patients receiving at least one appropriate treatment (aRRR = 1.98, 99 % CI = 1.21-3.24).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nEffects of OSS on workload were not statistically significant. Significant OSS effects on facility performance across subgroups were heterogeneous. OSS supported MLP who diagnosed and treated patients to apply IMID knowledge. For other providers, OSS supported team work to manage emergency patients. This evidence on OSS effectiveness could inform interventions to improve health workers' capacity to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article 10.1186/s12889-016-3375-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study was about how we can improve how health workers diagnose and treat infectious diseases. We tried two different methods: a special classroom training that covered all aspects of managing infectious diseases, and on-the-job, hands-on guidance. The aim was to see if the hands-on guidance, or On-Site Support (OSS), made a difference in how health workers handled emergency cases, HIV testing, and treatment of malaria and pneumonia patients. Specifically, we wanted to compare how health workers who had gone through the classroom training performed against those who hadn't.\n\nMETHODS.\n36 health facilities took part in the study, split evenly into two groups. Two health workers from each group were chosen to go through the special classroom training. Everyone in one group got hands-on guidance for nine months, while the other group did not. We analyzed almost a year's worth of outpatient visits (over 669,000) in which the care provider was mentioned, to see what effect the hands-on guidance had.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that having on-site guidance didn't significantly change the number of patients a health worker saw each day. But for health workers who had been through the classroom training, the guidance helped in three areas: treating malaria correctly, not prescribing antimalarial drugs if a test was negative, and treating respiratory infections in people who tested negative for tuberculosis. For health workers who hadn't been through the special classroom training, the guidance was helpful in managing emergency patients better.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWhile on-site guidance didn't change how many patients a healthcare worker saw, it did show positive effects on how they managed patients, especially in emergency situations. This sort of hands-on guidance seems to help health workers use their training better, and improve care. These findings could help improve interventions to improve the capacity of health workers to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nThere is more material related to this study available online for those with proper authorization.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Integrated Infectious Diseases Capacity Building Evaluation (IDCAP) teams designed and implemented two health worker in-service training approaches: 1) an off-site classroom-based integrated management of infectious diseases (IMID) course with distance learning aspects, and 2) on-site support (OSS), an educational outreach intervention.", "start": 12, "end": 350, "facts": [{"fact": "IDCAP teams designed and implemented two health worker in-service training approaches.", "label": 1, "proba": [0.29639720916748047, 0.6992816925048828, 0.004321044776588678]}, {"fact": "The first approach is an off-site classroom-based integrated management of infectious diseases (IMID) course.", "label": 1, "proba": [0.0788615271449089, 0.5503347516059875, 0.37080371379852295]}, {"fact": "The IMID course includes distance learning aspects.", "label": 1, "proba": [0.007443276233971119, 0.9917069673538208, 0.0008497314993292093]}, {"fact": "The second approach is on-site support (OSS).", "label": 0, "proba": [0.9926820397377014, 0.0050362697802484035, 0.002281712368130684]}, {"fact": "OSS is an educational outreach intervention.", "label": 1, "proba": [0.007685682736337185, 0.8300620317459106, 0.1622522473335266]}]}, {"sentence": "We tested the effects of OSS on workload and 12 facility performance indicators for emergency triage assessment and treatment, HIV testing, and malaria and pneumonia case management among outpatients by two subgroups: 1) mid-level practitioners (MLP) who attended IMID training (IMID-MLP) and 2) health workers who did not (No-IMID).", "start": 351, "end": 684, "facts": [{"fact": "A test was conducted on the effects of OSS on workload and 12 facility performance indicators.", "label": 1, "proba": [0.032455600798130035, 0.9485683441162109, 0.01897607557475567]}, {"fact": "The test was also conducted on emergency triage assessment and treatment.", "label": 1, "proba": [0.04197337105870247, 0.9531477093696594, 0.004878901410847902]}, {"fact": "The test was conducted on HIV testing.", "label": 2, "proba": [0.1522497981786728, 0.25033748149871826, 0.5974127650260925]}, {"fact": "The test was conducted on malaria case management among outpatients.", "label": 0, "proba": [0.9709439277648926, 0.025743842124938965, 0.003312178421765566]}, {"fact": "The test was conducted on pneumonia case management among outpatients.", "label": 0, "proba": [0.9423547387123108, 0.048965055495500565, 0.008680252358317375]}, {"fact": "The test was conducted by two subgroups.", "label": 0, "proba": [0.9527307152748108, 0.004523955751210451, 0.04274526983499527]}, {"fact": "One subgroup consisted of mid-level practitioners who attended IMID training (IMID-MLP).", "label": 1, "proba": [0.005415383260697126, 0.9937103986740112, 0.0008741928613744676]}, {"fact": "The other subgroup consisted of health workers who did not attend IMID training (No-IMID).", "label": 0, "proba": [0.9126365184783936, 0.08244045823812485, 0.004923088010400534]}]}, {"sentence": "METHODS.", "start": 686, "end": 694, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Thirty-six health facilities participated in the IDCAP trial, with 18 randomly assigned to Arm A and 18 to Arm B.

implantable venous access systems (TIVAS) are not routinely used. Compared with Hickman catheters, these devices are more expensive and complex to insert. However, it is unclear whether the higher costs may be offset by perceived greater health benefits. This pilot trial aimed to generate relevant data to inform the design of a larger definitive randomised controlled trial.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis was a phase II prospective, randomised, open trial from two UK oncology centres. The primary end point was overall complication rate. Secondary end points included individual complication rates, time to first complication and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. An economic evaluation was also carried out.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 100 patients were randomised in a 3 : 1 ratio to receive a Hickman or a TIVAS. Overall, 54% of patients in the Hickman arm suffered one or more complications compared with 38% in the TIVAS arm (one-sided P=0.068). In the Hickman arm, 28% of the devices were removed prematurely due to a complication compared with 4% in the TIVAS arm. Quality of life based on the device-specific questionnaire was greater in the TIVAS arm for 13 of the 16 questions. The economic evaluation showed that Hickman arm was associated with greater mean cost per patient \u00a31803 (95% CI 462, 3215), but similar quality-adjusted life years \u22120.01 (95% CI \u22120.15, 0.15) than the TIVAS arm.

These are devices that allow doctors to access your veins for treatments or taking blood samples. They're more expensive and trickier to put in than the usually used Hickman catheters. We're not sure if the extra costs of TIVAS might be worth it because of possible health benefits. We ran a small trial to get more information and help design a bigger, more detailed trial later.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis trial involved two cancer centres in the UK and was organized to observe and compare the use of Hickman catheters and TIVAS. We looked at how many problems arose overall and for each treatment, how long it took for the first problem to happen, and how patients\u2019 quality of life was affected. We also looked at the economic impact of each treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had 100 patients divide into two groups for the trial. More than half of those with the Hickman catheter had one or more problems, while less than half with the TIVAS system did. In the Hickman group, about a third had to have their catheter removed early because of problems, while only a tiny portion in the TIVAS group did. Based on a questionnaire, patients with TIVAS were happier with their treatment in most areas. Cost-wise, using the Hickman catheter was more expensive per person. However, when we consider quality of life adjustment, the costs were about the same. But again, these results are not confirmed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTIVAS devices might be the more cost-effective option compared to Hickman catheters.

aim of our study was to research the effects of levosimendan (LS) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) combination on systolic and diastolic ventricular function after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who required endoventricular patch repair (EVPR).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nWe studied 70 patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. LS and SNP combination was administered in 35 patients (study group, SG). In the remaining patients, normal saline solution was given (placebo group, PG). Levosimendan (10\u03bcgr/kg) started 4 h prior to operation and we stopped LS before the initiation of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). During the rewarming period, we started again levosimendan (10\u03bcgr/kg) in combination with SNP (0.1-0.2 \u03bcgr/kg/min). If mean blood pressure decreased by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values, for corrected of mean arterial pressure, the volume loading was performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate. Hemodynamic variables, inotrophyc requirement, and laboratory values were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nFive patients died (7.14%) post-surgery (one from SG and 4 from PG) due to low cardiac out-put syndrome (LOS). At the postoperative period, cardiac output and stroke volume index was higher in SG (mean\u00b1sd;29.1\u00b16.3 vs. 18.4\u00b14.9 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122 (P<0.0001)). Stroke volume index (SVI) decreased from 29\u00b110mL/m2 preoperatively to 22\u00b114mL/m2 in the early postoperative period in group 1. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.002). Cardiac index was higher in SG (320.7\u00b137.5 vs. 283.0\u00b183.9 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122 (P=0.009)). The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6\u00b12.7 vs. 10.4\u00b12.0 mg/kg, P< 0.008), and postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P< 0.01). Ten patients (28.5%) in SG and 21 patients (60%) in PG required inotrophyc support (P<0.001). We used IABP in eight patients (22.8%) in SG and 17 patients (48.5%) in CG (P=0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis study showed that LS and SNP combination impressive increase in left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions including LVEF. The use of this combination achieved more less inotrophics and IABP requirement. We therefore suggest preoperative and peroperative levosimendan and SNP combination.", "simplification": "GOAL:\nOur study wanted to see how the combination of two drugs, levosimendan (LS) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), impacts the heart's ability to pump during and after heart bypass surgery in people who also needed another procedure to fix the inside wall of the heart.\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe had 70 heart disease patients with a type of heart damage that causes it to enlarge. We gave half the patients the drug combination and the other half a harmless salt solution (as a comparison group). The levosimendan was started 4 hours before surgery and stopped before the start of the heart bypass; during the last part of surgery, levosimendan was restarted along with SNP. If a patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during this process, a volume increasing solution was given to correct it. We recorded many patients' blood measurements, their need for heart-strengthening drugs, and laboratory test results.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nAfter surgery, 5 patients died due to heart complications (one from the drug group and four from the comparison group). Patients given the drugs had stronger heart function stats compared to those who weren't. These patients also needed less supportive drugs and less interventional equipment post-surgery. Various measurements like cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac index were better in the drug group. Also, fewer people in the drug group needed help from heart-strengthening drugs or equipment post-surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe study shows that the LS and SNP combination really improved heart function during and after surgery. Using these drugs led to less need for other supporting drugs or equipment. Thus, we suggest using this drug combination before and during surgery.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE.", "start": 0, "end": 10, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "The aim of our study was

Twenty people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I through III) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a balance-based exergaming group (N = 10) or a balance training group (N = 10) for an 8-week balance training period. Postural stability was assessed using the limits of stability (LOS) and one-leg stance (OLS) tests. Balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the timed up and go (TUG) test. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter training, participants in the balance-based exergaming group showed significant improvements in LOS performance, and in the eyes-closed condition of the OLS test. Both training programs led to improvements in BBS and TUG performance. Furthermore, balance-based exergaming training resulted in significantly better performance in directional control in the LOS test (78.9 \u00b1 7.65 %) compared with conventional balance training (70.6 \u00b1 9.37 %).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBalance-based exergaming training resulted in a greater improvement in postural stability compared with conventional balance training.

We had twenty people with Parkinson's disease take part. These people were either at the early, middle or later stages of the disease. Half of them were put into a group that did the Kinect exergame for balance, and the other half were put into a group that did traditional balance training. This went on for 8 weeks. We used certain tests (LOS, OLS, BBS and TUG) to measure their balance and stability before and after the training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the training, we found that the group that did the Kinect exergame had better results in some stability tests. Both groups improved in the BBS and TUG balance tests. In one of the LOS tests, the exergaming group did much better than the traditional training group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe group that did the Kinect exergame improved more in their stability than the group that did traditional training. Our study suggests that these kind of exercise games can be helpful for people with Parkinson's disease.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe details of the trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov.NCT02671396\n\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL.\nThere's more information online in the supplement of the article.

infiltration of ketamine-bupivacaine on postoperative pain relief after tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nPatients (n = 100), with renal stone who were candidates for PCNL were randomized to five groups with 20 cases in each: Group C, 10 mL of saline solution was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group B, 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group BK1, 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group BK2, 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 1.5 mg/kg ketamine was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group K, 10 mL of saline solution containing 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was intravenously administered. Post-operative pain scores were compared between groups as the primary objective. Comparison of Sedation Scores, rescue analgesic consumption, time to the first rescue analgesics administration, hemodynamic and SpO2 values were regarded as the secondary objective.\n\nRESULTS.\nMean VAS scores in the first 30 min and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 h of post-operative period were significantly lower in groups BK1 and BK2 in comparison with the other groups (P < 0.05). Also, time to first rescue analgesics administration was longer in the same groups (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nInfiltration of ketamine plus bupivacaine provides superior analgesic effects in PCNL surgery compared with other methods.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND:\nResearchers have been increasingly exploring the use of ketamine - a drug known to relieve pain - for reducing post-surgery discomfort.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of injecting ketamine directly into the bloodstream, in addition to combined use with another painkiller called bupivacaine, in subsiding pain after a specific kidney stone removal surgery (tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\n100 patients slated for kidney stone removal were randomly categorized into five groups. Each group received different treatment procedures - some received saline solutions, some received bupivacaine, while others were given varying doses of ketamine or a mix of ketamine and bupivacaine. The main goal was to compare the different groups' pain levels after surgery. Other factors such as the level of consciousness, the use of extra painkillers, timing of additional painkiller use, and their overall vital signs were also inspected.\n\nRESULTS:\nPatients that received a combination of bupivacaine and ketamine (both in lower and higher doses) reported lower pain levels within the first half-hour following surgery, and consumed fewer additional painkillers during the first day after surgery, compared to other groups. After surgery, these patients also were granted a longer time before needing extra painkillers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nApplying a mix of ketamine and bupivacaine proved better at relieving pain after kidney

"PURPOSE.\nPatients with glaucoma who do not keep their follow-up eye care appointments are at risk for developing more severe ocular disease. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nPatients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (\u00b1standard deviation) was 71.2 (\u00b110.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155). The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) number of follow-up visits during the 1-year study period was 1.3 (\u00b11.3) for G1, 1.6 (\u00b11.3) for G2, and 1.3 (\u00b11.1) for G3 (P=0.48). Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of \u22651 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28). Sub-analysis of adherence rates for patients who attended \u22652 follow-up visits were 91.3% (n=21/23) for G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) for G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) for G3, (P=0.11).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nHelp from a patient navigator did not increase the likelihood of keeping \u22651 follow-up appointment in an office-based setting. Adherence rates for follow-up appointments reached close to 70% or above in a self-selected patient population.", "simplification": "PURPOSE.\nThis study looked at how having a 'patient navigator' - a person who helps guide a patient through their healthcare journey - could change how regularly patients with glaucoma go to their follow-up eye check-ups. This is important because missed appointments can lead to worse vision problems. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS. \nThe study used people who were diagnosed with some form of glaucoma after taking an eye test in Philadelphia, USA. These people were put into three groups for one year: one group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator, the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator, and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator. Then, they compared how well each group stuck to their appointment schedule. \n\nRESULTS.\n155 patients were included in this study. They were generally around 71 years old, mostly women, and primarily African-American. The number of follow-up visits during the year was about the same between the three groups. Around 70% to 82% of patients in all groups attended at least one follow-up visit. When looking at only the people who attended two or more follow-up visits, the group with a patient navigator within the community had the highest turn out. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nEven though having a patient navigator didn't make people more likely to go to an office for their check-ups, people did have a decent rate of attendance at their follow-up visits on their own. It is unclear if the community-based care with a navigator helped with the higher rate of attendance for two or more check-ups, which suggests more study is needed.", "original_sentences":

Maraviroc, a CCR5 blocker, has been shown to decrease immune activation and monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques in murine experiments. Therefore, we examined the effect of maraviroc intensification on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in abacavir-treated HIV-infected patients and its effect on immunological and inflammatory parameters.\n\nMETHODS.\nA open-label prospective crossover study with a duration of 16 weeks: 8 weeks of intervention (maraviroc intensification) and 8 weeks of control (unchanged cART regimen). FMD, HIV-specific variables, expression of HIV co-receptors, markers of inflammation and coagulation and cellular markers of immune activation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16. The changes (\u0394) in these variables were compared between intervention and control periods using non-parametric tests. To evaluate the relation with the change in FMD, linear regression modeling was used.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-one male patients with suppressed plasma HIV-RNA, on cART, had a known HIV infection for 9.2 years (IQR 6.9\u201313.5) with abacavir use for 6.5 years (2.8\u20139.3). A significantly increased FMD of 0.73% (IQR \u22120.25 to 1.70) was seen after maraviroc intensification compared to a decrease of \u22120.42% (IQR \u22121.89 to 0.25; p = 0.049) in the control period. There was a negative relation between \u0394FMD with \u0394D-dimer (\u03b2 \u221222.70, 95% CI \u221239.27; \u22126.13, p = 0.011) and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells (\u03b2 \u22120.16, 95% CI \u22120.28; \u22120.04, p = 0.013), adjusted for age and duration of HIV.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nMaraviroc intensification modestly improves endothelial function in HIV-infected patients on an abacavir-containing regimen.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT01389063.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40121-016-0115-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis is a study on the drug Maraviroc and its effects on HIV patients who are also taking the drug Abacavir, which some believe may increase their risk of heart disease. Maraviroc is known to decrease immune activation and inflammation in mouse experiments, so we wanted to see if it has similar effects in HIV patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a study for 16 weeks, with half of that time the patients were given extra Maraviroc in addition to their regular HIV medication, and the other half they didn't change anything in their treatment. We tested a range of health markers at the start, halfway and end of the study. We then compared the results from when the patients were given extra Maraviroc and when they weren't.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe study was carried out in 21 male patients who had been living with HIV for an average of 9.2 years and were taking Abacavir for an average of 6.5 years. We found that Maraviroc improved blood flow which is beneficial for heart health. Also, there was a negative relationship between improvements in blood flow and inflammation, as well as immune activation, which suggests Maraviroc might be protecting against inflammation and immune activation.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdding Maraviroc modestly improves blood flow in HIV patients on Abacavir.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT01389063.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nFor those with

lifestyle changes. The present study aims to test this hypothesis using data from the Food4Me study. This was a 6-month Internet-based randomised controlled trial conducted across seven centres in Europe where individuals received either general healthy eating advice or varying levels of personalised nutrition advice. Participants who received genotype-based personalised advice were informed whether they had the risk (CT/TT) (n = 178) or non-risk (CC) (n = 141) alleles of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in relation to cardiovascular health and the importance of a sufficient intake of folate. General linear model analysis was used to assess changes in folate intake between the MTHFR risk, MTHFR non-risk and control groups from baseline to month 6 of the intervention.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were no differences between the groups for age, gender or BMI. However, there was a significant difference in country distribution between the groups (p = 0.010). Baseline folate intakes were 412 \u00b1 172, 391 \u00b1 190 and 410 \u00b1 186 \u03bcg per 10 MJ for the risk, non-risk and control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of changes in folate intakes from baseline to month 6. Similarly, there were no changes in reported intake of food groups high in folate.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese results suggest that knowledge of MTHFR 677C \u2192 T genotype did not improve folate intake in participants with the risk variant compared with those with the non-risk variant.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01530139\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12263-016-0539-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThe researchers wanted to see if knowing about your personal genetic risks would encourage you to make healthier diet and lifestyle choices. They ran a 6-month online trial across seven locations in Europe. Some people received general healthy eating advice while others received advice tailored to their personal nutrition needs. One specific group learned whether they had a certain gene variant that increased their risk of heart disease. They were told about the importance of eating enough folate, a type of B vitamin. The researchers then analyzed changes in their folate intake over six months. \n\nRESULTS.\nThere wasn't any difference in age, gender, or body weight between the groups. Although, the number of participants from each country was not evenly spread across the groups. The amount of folate the groups ate at the start of the trial was about the same. Over six months, no group's folate intake changed significantly. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe finding implies that just knowing if you have a risky gene variant does not necessarily encourage you to eat more

"BACKGROUND.\nLittle is known about action-perception learning processes underlying prosthetic skills in body-powered prosthesis users. Body-powered prostheses are controlled through a harness connected by a cable that might provide for limited proprioceptive feedback. This study aims to test transfer of training basic tasks to functional tasks and to describe the changes over time in kinematics of basic tasks of novice body-powered prosthesis users.\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty able-bodied participants and 17 controls participated in the study, using a body-powered prosthetic simulator. Participants in the training group were divided over four groups and practiced during a 2-week-period either direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination of these tasks. Deformable objects with different compliances had to be manipulated while kinematic variables and grip force control were assessed. Functional performance was measured with the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) prior to and after the training sessions, and after 2 weeks and 3 months retention. The control group only performed the SHAP tests.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll four training groups and the control group improved on the SHAP, also after a period of non-use. Type of training had a small but significant influence on the improvements of the SHAP score. On a kinematic level movement times decreased and hook closing velocities increased over time. The indirect grasping group showed significantly shorter plateau times than the other training groups. Grip force control only improved a little over training.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTraining action-perception couplings of body-powered prosthesis in basic tasks transferred to functional tasks and this lasted after a period of non-use. During training movement times decreased and the indirect grasping group showed advantages. It is advisable to start body-powered training with indirect grasping tasks but also to practice hook-object orientations.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12984-016-0197-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "Background:\nThis study looked at how people learn to use a body-powered prosthetic device. These devices are controlled by a harness and cable, and provide limited feedback to the user about limb position. The aim was to understand how practicing basic tasks could be applied to real-world tasks, and how this learning changes over time in new users of such prosthetics.\n\nMethods:\nThe study involved 30 regular people and 17 controls; all of them used a simulated prosthetic device for the study. Those in the training group were split into four sub-groups and practiced either direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination for two weeks. They had to manipulate soft objects of different hardness while researchers measured their movement and grip strength. Performance was measured before and after the training sessions, and then again after two weeks and three months of no practice. The control group only did the performance tests.\n\nResults:\nAll four training groups and the control group improved on the performance tests, even after they stopped using the device. The type of training did slightly affect how much they improved. Overall, they became faster with their movements and increased the speed at which they closed the device's hook over time. The group that practiced indirect grasping improved faster than the other groups. Grip strength didn't improve much with training.\n\nConclusions:\nPracticing basic tasks with a body-powered prosthetic device can help users get better at real-world tasks, even after they've stopped practicing. Users got faster and the group that practiced indirect grasping progressed faster. It's recommended that new users of such devices start practicing with indirect grasping tasks and also practice different ways to orient the hook.\n\nElectronic Supplementary Material:\nMore

alpha-2 agonist, has sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects without respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine can cause a biphasic cardiovascular response, and induce transient hypertension. Hypotension is a common complication of spinal anesthesia. Decreasing anxiety of patients before procedure is important for high quality of procedure. This study aimed to compare the incidence of hypotension and patients' anxiety and comfort levels when dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered before and after spinal anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nSeventy-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II were randomly allocated into two groups. Spinal anesthesia was performed using 12 mg of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine. In Group A, 1 \u03bcg/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered for 10 min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/hr after 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Patients in Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Perioperative vital signs, anxiety (using the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and comfort (using the numerical rating scale) were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in Group A (16.1%) than in Group B (48.4%) during infusion of dexmedetomidine (p = 0.01). The need for treatment of hypotension is higher in Group B than Group A (p = 0.02). The incidence of bradycardia and desaturation did not significantly differ between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences regarding the patients' anxiety and comfort.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nHypotension is more frequently occurred, and the treatment of hypotension is more needed in Group B. The intravenously administration of dexmedetomidine before spinal anesthesia has no advantages in hemodynamic status and patients' comfort compared to that after spinal anesthesia during lower limb surgery.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02155010. Retrospectively registered on May 22, 2014.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nDexmedetomidine is a drug that helps to reduce pain, anxiety, and causes sleepiness without affecting breathing. However, it can cause changes in blood pressure. Sometimes, after spinal anesthesia, patients can experience low blood pressure. We wanted to understand if giving dexmedetomidine before or after the anesthesia could affect blood pressure changes and patient comfort level.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested this idea on 74 patients, who were all generally healthy or had only mild systemic illness. They were divided into two groups. Both received spinal anesthesia and dexmedetomidine, but the order in which they received the drug was different.\nGroup A received the drug after the anesthesia, while Group B received it before. We monitored their vital signs during and after surgery and also used questionnaires to understand their level of anxiety and comfort.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was a difference in blood pressure changes between the two groups. Fewer patients in Group A experienced low blood pressure compared to Group B. Also, more patients in Group B required treatment for low blood pressure. However, heart rate and oxygen levels were similar in both groups and there were no significant differences in the patients' anxiety and comfort levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study found that more patients experienced low blood pressure and required treatment when given Dexmedetomidine before rather than after spinal anesthesia. However, giving the drug before or after anesthesia didn't make a significant difference in patients' comfort or anxiety levels during lower limb surgeries.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial is

One of these comorbidities is the metabolic syndrome that is in correlation with abdominal fat thickness and waist circumference. Various methods were used to reduce abdominal fat thickness such as liposuction. A noninvasive method is the topical agent. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of Arnebia euchroma (AE) ointment on the abdominal fat thickness.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThis study was a double-blind clinical trial which was done at the endocrinology clinic in Khorshid Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, in 2014. After explaining the procedure and obtaining informed consent, the candidates were randomly divided into the case and control groups. The participants of the case and control groups applied AE ointment or placebo for 6 weeks on their abdominal area. Body mass index, waist and buttock circumference, and abdominal fat thickness were measured in both case and control groups at their first visit and then at the next 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We used t-test for comparing parametric variables between groups, paired t-test for changes from baseline to final, and repeated measure ANOVA for changes at different steps.\n\nRESULTS.\nSixty female candidates participated in this study (thirty in each group). Ten patients left the study and fifty participants finished the trial. At the end of the study, participants had a significant weight loss (2.96 \u00b1 1.6 kg, P < 0.001) that was slightly more in the case group (3.15 \u00b1 1.5 kg vs. 2.75 \u00b1 1.7, P = 0.375). Abdominal circumference also decreased significantly in the participants (11.3 \u00b1 6.7 cm, P < 0.001), but the changes were more significant in the case group (13.9 vs. 6.5 cm, P = 0.004). Similarly, abdominal fat thickness decreased significantly in the participants (2.3 \u00b1 1.1 cm, P < 0.001), although changes were not significantly different between two groups (2.53 vs. 2.04 cm, P = 0.139).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nTopical AE ointment can reduce the abdominal fat thickness as well as the waist circumference without causing any side effect.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nObesity is a major health issue around the world and can cause a range of other health problems. One of these problems is called metabolic syndrome, which is linked to fat in the stomach area. Various ways have been used to reduce this fat, like liposuction. A noninvasive method, meaning it doesn't involve surgery, is the use of a special cream. In this study, we looked at how effective Arnebia Euchroma (AE), a type of cream, is at reducing stomach fat. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study was conducted in a medical clinic in Iran in 2014. After explaining the study and getting their approval, we divided the participants into two groups. One group used the AE cream on their stomach area for 6 weeks, the other group used a placebo (a cream with no active ingredients). We measured their body mass index, waist and buttock size, and stomach fat at the beginning, and then again after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We used different statistical methods to compare the results.\n\nRESULTS.\nSixty women took part in the study (thirty in each group). Ten dropped out, so fifty completed it. By the end, the participants had lost a significant amount of weight (around 2.96 kg), slightly more in the group using the AE cream. Their waist size also went down significantly, more so in the AE group. The thickness of their stomach fat also decreased significantly in both groups, although there was no significant difference between the two groups in that respect.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nUsing AE cream can

This study is looking into how a drug called hydrocortisone might help prevent these shivering episodes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe tested this in a clinical trial with ninety patients who were all having surgery that required spinal anesthesia. We split them into three groups. The first two groups got different doses of hydrocortisone (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg respectively), and the third group got a saline (or saltwater) solution, which acted as a control. We then compared whether people in each group experienced shivering after their operations.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that out of the 31 patients who experienced shivering, 9 were from the first group (1 mg/kg hydrocortisone), 5 were from the second group (2 mg/kg hydrocortisone), and 17 were from the third group (normal saline). These differences were statistically significant, meaning they likely weren't due to pure chance.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur results suggest that giving patients hydrocortisone, at least in the dose of 1

We designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nA total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. The intensity of pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine than those receiving saline (P < 0.012).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPre-treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was found to be as effective as lignocaine in reducing propofol injection-induced pain.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\nThe drug Propofol, often used to put people to sleep before surgeries, can sometimes cause mild to severe pain when injected. In our study, we wanted to see if adding two different drugs, methylprednisolone and lignocaine, could reduce this pain. We tested this on patients about to undergo heart surgery.\n\nWHAT WE DID\nWe had 165 adult patients who were going to have non-emergency heart surgery. We split them into three groups: one group was given a harmless saline solution (55 people), one was given 20 mg of lignocaine (55 people), and the last was given 125 mg of methylprednisolone (also 55 people). We administered the drugs after applying a tourniquet and let it stay for 1 min before giving 1/4th of the typical Propofol dose. We then asked the patients to rate their pain when the Propofol was injected.\n\nRESULTS\nAbout 71% of the patients given only the saline solution experienced pain. For the group given lignocaine, the pain was reduced to about 31%. And for those given methylprednisolone, the pain was further lowered to about 36%. The added drugs significantly reduced the pain when compared to just the saline solution (we used statistical tests to confirm this).\n\nWHAT WE CONCLUDED\nAdding the drug methylprednisolone to

They were given either CKD-828 in two different doses, or they continued on S-amlodipine. This was done for 8 weeks. We then compared how well the two treatments worked by looking at changes in blood pressure. Side effects, changes in vital signs, and physical exam results were looked at for safety.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter 8 weeks, all treatments helped to lower blood pressure. However, the CKD-828 treatment in both doses worked better than S-amlodipine alone, both at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. There were also fewer side effects with one dose of CKD-828 compared to S-amlodipine. Increasing the dose of one component of CKD-828 did not lead to any unexpected side effects, indicating that it is safe.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nCKD-828 seems to be both effective and safe for patients with

Preservation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important during maintenance therapy; we evaluated the effect of olaparib on HRQoL in this Phase II trial (NCT00753545, Study 19).\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients received olaparib 400 mg b.i.d. (capsules) or placebo until progression. Patient-reported HRQoL and disease-related symptoms were evaluated using the FACT-Ovarian (FACT-O) questionnaire (completed at baseline and every 28 days until progression), the FACT/NCCN Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI) and the Trial Outcome Index (TOI). TOI of the FACT-O was the primary measure.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall, 265 women were randomised to maintenance olaparib (n=136) or placebo (n=129). Compliance for HRQoL assessment was high (\u223c80% over time). Most patients in both arms reported a best response of 'no change' on TOI (81%) and other HRQoL measures. There were no statistically significant differences in time to worsening or improvement rates of TOI, FOSI and FACT-O scores in the overall, BRCAm and germline BRCAm populations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nMaintenance treatment with olaparib was well tolerated and had no adverse impact on HRQoL in this study of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer who had responded to their most recent platinum-based therapy (partial or complete response). Interpretation of the HRQoL results in this population may differ from patients who have not responded to their most recent platinum-based therapy.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at a drug called olaparib that is currently used to slow down the growth of aggressive ovarian cancer. The drug seems most effective in patients with a specific gene mutation. Part of the study looked at whether the quality of life for patients using this drug was affected.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients either took olaparib capsules twice a day or a placebo until their cancer got worse. They reported on their quality of life and how their disease was affecting them using specific surveys. The main measurement they looked at was a score from one of these questionnaires.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn total, 265 women were part of this study, with just over half taking olaparib and the rest taking a placebo. Most women in both groups reported 'no change' in their quality of life. There were no major differences found in the time it took for quality of life to get worse or improve in any of the test groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOlaparib treatment was generally well-tolerated by patients and did not seem to have any negative effects on their quality of life.

controlled trial (RCT) with a baseline outcome followed by a few assessments at fixed follow-up times typically invokes traditional analytic methods (eg, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), longitudinal data analysis (LDA)). 'Constrained' longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) is a well-established unconditional technique that constrains means of baseline to be equal between arms. We use an analysis of fasting lipid profiles from the Group Medical Clinics (GMC) longitudinal RCT on patients with diabetes to illustrate applications of ANCOVA, LDA and cLDA to demonstrate theoretical concepts of these methods including the impact of missing data.\n\nMETHODS.\nFor the analysis of the illustrated example, all models were fit using linear mixed models to participants with only complete data and to participants using all available data.\n\nRESULTS.\nWith complete data (n=195), 95% CI coverage are equivalent for ANCOVA and cLDA with an estimated 11.2 mg/dL (95% CI \u221219.2 to \u22123.3; p=0.006) lower mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in GMC compared with usual care. With all available data (n=233), applying the cLDA model yielded an LDL improvement of 8.9 mg/dL (95% CI \u221216.7 to \u22121.0; p=0.03) for GMC compared with usual care. The less efficient, LDA analysis yielded an LDL improvement of 7.2 mg/dL (95% CI \u221217.2 to 2.8; p=0.15) for GMC compared with usual care.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUnder reasonable missing data assumptions, cLDA will yield efficient treatment effect estimates and robust inferential statistics. It may be regarded as the method of choice over ANCOVA and LDA.", "simplification": "GOAL\nWe want to understand the best way to analyze data from a study that is comparing two treatments for diabetes. This type of study is usually done by comparing the baseline, or starting, measurements of the patients' blood fat levels (fasting lipid profiles) to follow-up measurements taken after some time. There are traditional ways to do this comparison (like ANCOVA and LDA), but we're also exploring a different approach, called cLDA, that assumes the starting measurements are the same for both treatments. We want to see which method is the most reliable, considering some patients might not complete the trial.\n\nHOW WE DID IT\nWe analyzed data from a study conducted at Group Medical Clinics (GMC) using all three methods -ANCOVA, LDA, and cLDA- and compared the results. We ran these tests on data from patients who finished the trial and also on data that includes patients who didn't finish.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\nWhen we used data from patients who completed the trial (195 people), both ANCOVA and cLDA showed that the GMC treatment lowered bad cholesterol levels (LDL) by about 11.2 mg/dL, significantly more than the usual care. When we used all available data (233 people), cLDA showed an LDL improvement of 8.9 mg/dL with the GMC treatment, but LDA showed only a 7.2 mg/dL improvement and wasn't as sure of this result.\n\nWHAT IT MEANS\nIf we take into account that some people might not complete the trial, cLDA seems to produce consistent and reliable results. It evaluates the effect of treatment very efficiently and its findings can be trusted. Thus, it may be a better choice compared to ANCOVA and LDA when looking at this type of data.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE.", "start": 0, "end": 10, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "The

They were split into three groups, and each group inhaled either lavender oil, linalyl acetate (another substance found in many plants), or a control substance for 20 minutes. \n\nThe scientists checked things like blood pressure, heart rate, urinary issues, pain level, and overall satisfaction with life concerning urinary symptoms before and after this inhalation. They didn't see any differences in heart rate, blood pressure, or overall life satisfaction related to urinary symptoms across the three groups.\n\nHowever, they found two key differences among the groups. The patients who inhaled linalyl acetate reported less pain and less discomfort from remnants of the bladder tube than the other groups. \n\nIn simple words, the study suggests that inhaling linalyl

is a major concern, is unknown. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of an intraoperative goal-directed fluid restriction (GDFR) strategy on the postoperative outcome of high-risk patients undergoing brain surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nHigh-risk patients undergoing brain surgery were randomly assigned to a usual care group (control group) or a GDFR group. In the GDFR group, (1) fluid maintenance was restricted to 3\u00a0ml/kg/h of a crystalloid solution and (2) colloid boluses were allowed only in case of hypotension associated with a low cardiac index and a high stroke volume variation. The primary outcome variable was ICU length of stay, and secondary outcomes were lactates at the end of surgery, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, mortality at day 30, and costs.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 73 patients from the GDFR group were compared with 72 patients from the control group. Before surgery, the two groups were comparable. During surgery, the GDFR group received less colloid (1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 vs. 3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0ml/kg/h, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and less crystalloid (3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 vs. 5.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0ml/kg/h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than the control group. ICU length of stay was shorter (3\u00a0days [1\u20135] vs. 6\u00a0days [3\u201311], p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and ICU costs were lower in the GDFR group. The total number of complications (46 vs. 99, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043) and the proportion of patients who developed one or more complications (19.2 vs. 34.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) were smaller in the GDFR group. Hospital length of stay and costs, as well as mortality at 30\u00a0day, were not significantly reduced.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn high-risk patients undergoing brain surgery, intraoperative GDFR was associated with a reduction in ICU length of stay and costs, and a decrease in postoperative morbidity.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nWe're studying the effects of controlling the amount of fluids patients get during brain surgery. This control is important because in brain surgeries, swelling in the brain can be a big problem. We don't know whether controlling the fluids, with a strategy we're calling \"goal-directed fluid restriction\" (GDFR), makes a difference in how patients recover after surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had two groups of patients who needed brain surgery, and were at high risk for complications. One group was given the usual amount of fluids during their surgery (the control group), and the other group was given less fluid (the GDFR group). \n\nFor the GDFR group, we did two things: (1) We limited the fluids they got during surgery to 3ml per kilogram of their body weight each hour, using a clear liquid solution and (2) We only gave additional fluid packs if they showed signs of low blood pressure, lower heart output and higher fluctuations in blood volume.\n\nWe then studied different outcomes: how long they stayed in the ICU, the level of a specific acid (lactates) in their body after surgery, any complications they had after surgery, how long they stayed in the hospital, whether they died within 30 days after the surgery, and the cost of their treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe compared 73 patients in the GDFR group to 72 patients in the control group. Before surgery, both groups were similar. During surgery, we did end up giving less fluid to the GDFR group compared to the control group. After surgery, the GDFR group spent less time in the ICU and the cost of their stay was lower. Also, fewer patients in the GDFR group had any complications after surgery. But the time they spent in the hospital overall, their total hospital costs, and whether they died within 30 days were not significantly different between the two groups.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn high-risk patients needing brain surgery, limiting the amount of fluids they got during surgery (using our GDFR method) helped them recover better after surgery, needed less time in the ICU, and reduced their ICU costs. Also, fewer of these patients had complications after surgery.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "The value of goal-directed fluid

In the present study we aimed to combine these two separate areas to understand whether the speed of alcohol consumption is influenced by the type of alcohol health warning contained on the beverage.\n\nSUBJECT AND METHODS.\nIn the present study, female participants (N = 45) consumed an alcoholic beverage in a relaxed environment in one of three conditions: no health-warning label, a text-only health-warning label or a pictorial health-warning label with text.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that compared with the control condition, the beverage was consumed at a slower rate in the two health-warning conditions, which surprisingly did not differ from each other. Despite these effects, product acceptability did not differ between the text-only and control conditions.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThese are the first set of results to demonstrate how the use of strong health warnings on alcoholic beverages can influence actual drinking rate and further suggest that the beneficial effects of slowed consumption are possible in the absence of any reduction in consumer acceptability.", "simplification": "AIM.\nThis study aimed to find out if the kind of health warning on an alcoholic drink's bottle can affect how quickly people drink it. Previous studies found that scary health warnings make people realize the risks of drinking more clearly, and lead them to want to drink less.

We combined these two ideas to see if the type of health warning can make people drink slower.\n\nSUBJECT AND METHODS.\nWe tested this idea on 45 women. We gave them an alcoholic drink in a relaxed setting. There were three different groups: one group had drinks with no health warning, one had drinks with only a text warning, and one had drinks with a warning that included a picture and text.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that women drank slower when their drinks had a health warning, regardless of whether it was just text or included a picture. Interestingly, the speed was the same in both health warning groups. However, whether the drink had a warning or not did not affect whether they liked the drink.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis is the first study to show that strong health warnings on alcoholic drinks can make people drink slower.

Both groups of patients were given CPAP, a machine used for treating sleep apnea, for three months. \n\nThe goal of the study was to see if there was a difference in the patients' sleepiness score but the study found no difference between the two groups. However, those treated at home reported a better improvement in their sleep quality and life quality.\n\nIn terms of cost and waiting time, the home-based approach was significantly better. It was cheaper by about USD 1770 per patient and also reduced waiting times by about 5-6 months from their first doctor visit to getting the CPAP machine.\n\nTherefore, this study suggests that treating patients with suspected OSAS at home can be as effective as treating them in the hospital.

The AirtraqTM laryngoscope significantly reduced the IDS (mean \u2212 0.43 \u00b1 0.81) as compared with both McCoyTM (mean \u2212 1.63 \u00b1 1.49, P = 0.001) and Macintosh laryngoscope (mean \u22122.23 \u00b1 1.92, P < 0.001) and improved the Cormack-Lehane glottic view (77% grade 1 view and no patients with grade 3 or 4 view).

These 90 people were divided into three equal groups and each group was intubated using one of the devices.

We then used statistical analysis to compare the results. \n\nRESULTS.\nAll the patients in the three groups were successfully intubated. The Airtraq device made the process easier than the other two. It also provided a clearer view of the throat area.

This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that compared with monotherapy using a higher dose of palonosetron, using a lower dose of palonosetron in combination with droperidol could reduce the incidence of PONV and achieve similar prophylaxis against PONV after the aforementioned surgery.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nA total of 129 patients who were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II, aged between 18 and 70 years, and scheduled for eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery, were enrolled in this study. They were randomized into three groups: Group P2.5 (2.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron), Group P7.5 (7.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron), and Group P+D (2.5 \u03bcg/kg palonosetron and 15 \u03bcg/kg droperidol). Patients received the different antiemetic regimens intravenously 5 min before surgery. The severity of nausea and vomiting and the complete response (CR) rate during a 72-h postoperative period were assessed.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll patients completed the trial. The nausea score of Group P2.5 was significantly higher than those of the other two groups at 0\u20134 h and 24\u201348 h (P<0.05). Vomiting scores among all groups were similar during all intervals (P>0.05). Compared with Group P2.5, the CR rate was significantly improved at all intervals in Group P+D, except at 4\u201372 h, and was also elevated at 24\u201372 h in Group P7.5 (P<0.05). Fewer patients in Group P2.5 did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study (49%) compared with those in Group P7.5 (67%) and Group P+D (81%; P<0.01).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nCombining low-dose palonosetron with droperidol potentiated prophylaxis for PONV and achieved a similar prophylactic effect as that with a higher dose of palonosetron.", "simplification": "OBJECTIVE:\nThis study investigates if combining a low dose of the drug palonosetron with another drug called droperidol can help to reduce sickness (nausea and vomiting) experienced after a certain eye surgery, compared to using a higher dose of palonosetron alone. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nThis trial involved 129 adults, aged 18 to 70, that are categorised as healthy or having mild illness by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. They were going to have eye and orbital implant surgery. These patients were divided into three groups and each group received different anti-sickness treatments just before their surgery. Their levels of nausea, vomiting, and overall response to treatment were assessed for 72 hours after surgery. \n\nRESULTS:\nAll involved patients finished the study. The group receiving a low dose of palonosetron had more severe nausea than the other two groups at 0-4 and 24-48 hours after surgery. Vomiting levels were similar across all the groups. The complete response (no nausea or vomiting) rate was better in the group receiving a low-dose of palonosetron and droperidol than in the low dose palonosetron alone group, except at 4-72 hours, and was also better at 24-72 hours in the high dose palonosetron group. Less than half (49%) of the patients in the low dose palonosetron alone group didn't experience any sickness, compared to 67% in the high dose group and 81% in the combined treatment

limited when implemented in low-income settings due to engagement difficulties including nonadherence with skill-building homework and early discontinuation of treatment. Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct (mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group CBT treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group CBT in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group CBT for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching CBT skills.\n\nRESULTS.\nIntent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=\u22122.21, P=.03). Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=\u22121.65, P=.10). Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=\u2212.29, 95% CI \u22120.38 to \u22120.19, z=\u22125.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions (B=\u2212.20, 95% CI \u22120.32 to \u22120.07, z=\u22123.12, P=.002) experienced significant decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom reduction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool to sustain engagement in CBT for depression over time. There were no differences in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is known to help with depression. But it faces some obstacles when used in low-income communities like people's lack of commitment to regular therapy sessions and homework. However, using automated text messages may help solve these issues, as they can remind patients about their treatment and encourage them to stick with it.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe study tests if a texting service improves people's commitment and results in group therapy sessions for depression. The texts include prompts for mood monitoring and reminders about therapy content. The focus is specifically on whether this service boosts the number of therapy sessions attended, how long patients stay in therapy, and whether it successfully lessens depression symptoms in Spanish-speaking Latino patients with low income.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients were divided into two groups. One received the typical CBT treatment for depression alone (40 participants), while the second group received the same treatment plus the texting service (45 participants). The texting service included daily mood checks, daily reminders about therapy topics, and reminders about medication and therapy sessions. The therapist could access these texts and use them as part of the therapy process.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe study found that those who received texts as part of their treatment stayed in therapy for significantly longer. On average, they remained for 13.5 weeks, compared to just 3 weeks for the standard treatment group. Generally, the texting group also attended more therapy sessions, although this wasn't a significant difference. Both groups showed a substantial reduction in depression symptoms over the course of the treatment. Still, there wasn't a noticeable difference in symptom reduction between the two groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAutomated text messages can be a useful tool to keep patients engaged in their depression treatment. Even though both groups showed a decrease in symptoms, the texting service helped patients to stick with their therapy for longer. The fact that depression levels didn't differ much between the groups might have been influenced by a low number of responses from participants who quit therapy early.", "original_sentences":

"BACKGROUND.\nThe complexity of medication therapy in older adults with multiple comorbidities often leads to inappropriate prescribing. Drugs with anticholinergic properties are of particular interest because many are not recognized for this property; their use may lead to increased anticholinergic burden resulting in significant health risks, as well as negatively impacting cognition. Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions showed promise in addressing inappropriate medication use, but the effectiveness of targeted multidisciplinary team interventions addressing anticholinergic medications in older populations is yet to be determined.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted an 8-week, parallel-arm, randomized trial to evaluate whether a targeted patient-centered pharmacist\u2013physician team MTM intervention (\"targeted MTM intervention\") reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients enrolled in a longitudinal cohort at University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Study outcomes included changes in the medication appropriateness index (MAI) targeting anticholinergic medications and in the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score from baseline to the end of study.\n\nRESULTS.\nBetween October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 we enrolled and randomized 50 participants taking at least one medication with anticholinergic properties. Of these, 35 (70%) were women, 45 (90%) were white, and 33 (66%) were cognitively intact (clinical dementia rating [CDR] = 0); mean age was 77.7 \u00b1 6.6 years. At baseline, the mean MAI was 12.6 \u00b1 6.3; 25 (50%) of the participants used two or more anticholinergics, and the mean ADS score was 2.8 \u00b1 1.6. After randomization, although no statistically significant difference was noted between groups, we identified a potentially meaningful imbalance as the intervention group had more participants with intact cognition, and thus included CDR in all of the analyses. The targeted MTM intervention resulted in statistically significant CDR adjusted differences between groups with regard to improved MAI (change score of 3.6 (1.1) for the MTM group as compared with 1.0 (0.9) for the control group, p = 0.04) and ADS (change score of 1.0 (0.3) for the MTM group as compared with 0.2 (0.3) for the control group, p = 0.03).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur targeted MTM intervention resulted in improvement in anticholinergic medication appropriateness and reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients.

One group of drugs, known as anticholinergics, can be especially dangerous if overused, as they can have harmful effects on health and brain function. We wanted to see whether a special type of coordinated care between doctors and pharmacists could help reduce the use of these drugs. \n\nMETHODS.\nWe had older patients at the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center, who were taking at least one anticholinergic drug, participate in an 8-week study. We split them into two groups. One group received extra help and advice from a team of a pharmacist and a doctor, while the other group received usual care. We then compared how the groups changed in their use of anticholinergic drugs over the course of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe recruited 50 patients between October 2014 and September 2015. Most were women, white, and with normal brain function. On average, they were around 78 years old. At the start of the study, half of them were taking two or more anticholinergic drugs. After the study,  the group that received extra care saw improved medication appropriateness and reduced their use of anticholinergic drugs. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results suggest that the additional support from a doctor and pharmacist team can help older adults reduce their use of potentially harmful medications. This finding is an important step toward helping older adults take only the medications that benefit them the most. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study has been legally registered on

Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25). A maximum of four HLA\u2010matched peptides were selected based on the pre\u2010existing peptide\u2010specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration. T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm. The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression\u2010free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm. The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL\u20106 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen\u2010specific T cell responses. These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL\u20106\u2010mediated immune suppression. Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.", "simplification": "Biliary tract cancer (aBTC), a type of liver cancer, has a very poor survival rate.

The PPV is tailored specifically to each patient's immune response. To test this combined treatment, we gave it to 24 patients and compared them to a group of 25 patients who received only the PPV. \n\nResults showed that those who received the combination of CPA and PPV had a stronger immune response and displayed slower cancer progression, living longer than those who received only PPV. We noticed that the combo treatment worked better because it prevented the release of IL-6 protein, a substance which can suppress the immune system. \n\nIn conclusion, the addition of low-dose CPA to PPV shows promise as a potential treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer patients.

Self-determination theory (SDT) provides a useful framework to understand the nature of motivational interviewing (MI).\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study aimed to determine the effect of MI-based intervention using SDT on the promotion of PA among women in reproductive age.\n\nMETHODS.\nSeventy women in reproductive age were selected by clustering sampling method for this randomized controlled trial. The questionnaire included the variables of physical fitness test, SDT, and global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ). The validity of the questionnaires was approved using content validity ratio (CVR) and index (CVI). The reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaires and measures was approved using test-retest method and Cronbach's alpha test, respectively. The intervention group (n=35) received four MI sessions through theory and one standard education session about PA. The control group (n=35) received a standard education session about PA.\n\nRESULTS.\nFour months after the intervention, an increase in the mean scores of total PA (p<0.001, ES=4.77), physical fitness tests including flexibility (p<0.001, ES=1.59), muscular endurance (p<0.001, ES=2.0), cardiorespiratory endurance (p<0.001, ES=0.51), and a decrease in mean scores of agility test (p<0.001, ES= \u2212 0.51) and sedentary behavior (p<0.01, ES=\u2212 0.74) was observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group reported an increase in the scores of intrinsic motivation (p<0.001, ES=3.34), identified regulation (p<0.001, ES= 1.28), perceptions of competence (p<0.001, ES=0.81) and autonomy (p<0.001, ES=2.01), enjoyment (p<0.001, ES=0.98) and health motives (p<0.01, ES=0.19), health care climate (p<0.001, ES=4.6), and a decreased score of external regulation (p<0.01, ES=\u22120.55) and amotivation (p<0.01, ES= \u22120.56) over time, compared to the control group.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nMI-based intervention using SDT was effective on the promotion of PA.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe Trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial (http://www.irct.ir) with the Irct ID: IRCT2015101924592N1.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nRegular exercise helps to prevent many long-term illnesses. This research uses a theory known as Self-determination theory (SDT) which helps to understand people's motivations for exercise and how to increase their motivation.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe goal of the research was to use a method called motivational interviewing (MI), guided by SDT, to see if it could help encourage more exercise among women of child-bearing age.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study included 70 women fitting these criteria. They were picked using a random method and divided into two groups. All participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about their current levels of physical fitness and motivation for exercise. These questionnaires were tested and approved for reliability. One group (35 women) participated in four motivational interviewing sessions based on the SDT theory and one general education session about exercise. The other group (35 women) just participated in the general education session about exercise.\n\nRESULTS.\nFour months later, the women in the group that attended motivation interviewing sessions were doing significantly more physical activity overall. These women also showed improvements in specific fitness aspects: flexibility, muscular and cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) endurance. They also became less sedentary (inactive). Moreover, these women were more self-motivated to exercise, felt more competent, more in control, enjoyed exercising more, and had more health-driven reasons to exercise than women in the other group.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe research shows that using motivational interviewing based on the Self-determination Theory can successfully encourage women of child-bearing age to exercise more.\n\nTRIAL

cases. The Camino Verde cluster-randomised controlled trial in Mexico and Nicaragua assessed the impact of evidence-based community engagement in dengue prevention. The Mexican arm of the trial was conducted in 90 randomly selected communities in three coastal regions of Guerrero State. This study reports an analysis of a secondary outcome of the trial: household use of and expenditure on anti-mosquito products. We examined whether the education and mobilisation activities of the trial motivated people to spend less on anti-mosquito products.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe carried out a household questionnaire survey in the trial communities in 2010 (12,312 households) and 2012 (5349 households in intervention clusters, 5142 households in control clusters), including questions about socio-economic status, self-reported dengue illness, and purchase of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products in the previous month. We examined expenditures on anti-mosquito products at baseline in relation to social vulnerability and we compared use of and expenditures on these products between intervention and control clusters in 2012.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn 2010, 44.2% of 12,312 households reported using anti-mosquito products, with a mean expenditure of USD4.61 per month among those who used them. Socially vulnerable households spent less on the products. In 2012, after the intervention, the proportion of households who purchased anti-mosquito products in the last month was significantly lower in intervention clusters (47.8%; 2503/5293) than in control clusters (53.3%; 2707/5079) (difference \u2212 0.05, 95% CIca \u22120.100 to \u22120.010). The mean expenditure on the products, among those households who bought them, was USD6.43; 30.4% in the intervention clusters and 36.7% in the control clusters spent more than this (difference \u2212 0.06, 95% CIca \u22120.12 to \u22120.01). These expenditures on anti-mosquito products represent 3.3% and 3.8% respectively of monthly household income for the poorest 10% of the population in 2012.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe Camino Verde community mobilisation intervention, as well as being effective in reducing dengue infections, was effective in reducing household use of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\n(ISRCTN27581154).", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nDengue is a major health problem that affects people's health and finances in areas where it's common, due to costs associated with prevention and treatment. A project called the Camino Verde trial in Mexico and Nicaragua looked at how educating communities about dengue prevention could help. One part of this project in Mexico involved 90 different communities across three coastal regions. This study focuses on whether the trial led households to spend less money on products to ward off mosquitoes.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted surveys in 2010 (12,312 households) and 2012 (approximately 10,500 households) asking about things like income, whether anyone had had dengue, and spending on mosquito-prevention products in the previous month. We compared spending on these products to social vulnerability and also looked at the difference in product use and spending between the households that received the intervention and those that did not in 2012. \n\nRESULTS.\nIn 2010, nearly half of the households used anti-mosquito products, spending on average $4.61 per month. Households that were more vulnerable socially spent less. In 2012, after the intervention, fewer households in the intervention group (47.8%) bought anti-mosquito products as compared to the control group (53.3%). Those who did buy them spent on average $6.43; more households in the control group spent above this amount as compared to the intervention group. These costs represented about 3.3% and 3.8% of the monthly income for the poorest 10% of the population in 2012.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe Camino Verde project, which aimed to educate communities about dengue prevention, not only helped reduce dengue infections but also decreased the money households spent on anti-mosquito products.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered with the

olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) in improving health-related quality of life (QoL) in the treatment of bipolar depression in children and adolescents.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients aged 10\u201317 years with bipolar I disorder, depressed episode, baseline children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) total score \u226540, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score \u226415, and YMRS-item 1 \u2264 2 were randomized to OFC (6/25\u201312/50 mg/day olanzapine/fluoxetine; n = 170) or placebo (n = 85) for up to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients and parents completed the revised KINDL questionnaire for measuring health-related QoL in children and adolescents (KINDL-R) at baseline and endpoint. The mean change in CDRS-R total and item scores were used to compare improvement in symptomatology in patients taking OFC and placebo. Tests were 2-sided using a Type I error cutoff of 0.05, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.\n\nRESULTS.\nBaseline QoL as measured by the KINDL-R was substantially impaired relative to published norms for a healthy school-based sample. OFC-treated patients demonstrated an improvement over placebo at endpoint with respect to mean change from baseline in the patient-rated KINDL-R Self-esteem subscale score (p = 0.028), and in the parent KINDL-R ratings of emotional well-being (p = 0.020), Self-esteem (p = 0.030), and Family (p = 0.006). At endpoint, OFC-treated patients still had a lower QoL compared to the normative population. OFC showed significant improvement (p \u2264 0.05) versus placebo on the CDRS-R total score and on 7 of the 17 CDRS-R items.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nPatients aged 10\u201317 years with an acute episode of bipolar depression and their parents reported greater improvements (parents noticed improvements in more areas than did their offspring) on some aspects of QoL when treated with OFC compared with placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, KINDL-R endpoint scores remained lower than those of the, presumably healthy, control population.  \nClinical trial registration information A Study for Assessing Treatment of Patients Ages 10\u201317 with Bipolar Depression; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00844857", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looked at whether a combination of two drugs, olanzapine and fluoxetine (OFC), is effective in helping improve the life quality of kids and teenagers suffering from bipolar depression. \n\nMETHODS.\nPatients between the ages of 10 and 17 who have bipolar I disorder and are currently in a depressive phase were selected for this study. These patients were then divided into two groups: one received the drug combination (OFC), and the other received a placebo (a substance with no treatment effect). They were treated for up to 8 weeks. Using a questionnaire filled out by both patients and their parents at the beginning and end of the study, we were able to measure their life quality. We also checked the degree of depression symptoms by comparing scores of specific scales before and after treatment. \n\nRESULTS.\nAt the start of the study, the patients' quality of life was much lower than what you'd expect from a healthy child or teenager of the same age. After treatment, those who received the drug combination showed improvement in how they felt about themselves and in their emotional well-being, according to both the children and their parents. The parents also noted improvements in family dynamics. However, even after treatment, these patients' quality of life remained lower than that of a typical healthy child or teenager. The group that received the drug combination also demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared to the placebo group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBased on the study, children and teenagers experiencing a depressive phase of bipolar disorder, as well as their parents, reported better improvements in some aspects of life quality when treated with the drug combination than with the placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, their life quality was still lower than that of their healthy peers.

can be associated with considerable postoperative pain. While the benefits of paravertebral block (PVB) on pain after thoracotomy and mastectomy have been demonstrated, not enough investigations on the effects of PVB on pain after open cholecystectomy have been conducted. We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic PVB reduces pain scores, decreases opioid consumption, and prolongs analgesic request time after cholecystectomy.\n\nMETHODS.\nOf 52 patients recruited, 50 completed the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: the paravertebral group and the control group. The outcome measures were the severity of pain measured on numeric pain rating scale, total opioid consumption, and first analgesic request time during the first postoperative 24 hours.\n\nRESULT.\nThe main outcomes recorded during 24 hours after surgery were Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (NRS, 0\u201310), cumulative opioid consumption, and the first analgesic request time. Twenty four hours after surgery, NRS at rest was 4 (3\u20136) vs 5 (5\u20137) and at movement 4 (4\u20137) vs 6 (5\u20137.5) for the PVB and control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole observation period was statistically significant (P<0.05). Twenty-four hours after surgery, median (25th\u201375th percentile) cumulative morphine consumption was 0 (0\u20132) vs 2.5 (2\u20134) mg (P<0.0001) and cumulative tramadol consumption was 200 (150\u2013250) mg vs 300 (200\u2013350) mg in the paravertebral and in the control group, respectively (P=0.003). After surgery, the median (25th\u201375th percentile) first analgesic requirement time was prolonged in the PVB group in statistically significant fashion (P<0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\nSingle-shot thoracic PVB as a component of multi-modal analgesic regimen provided superior analgesia when compared with the control group up to 24 postoperative hours after cholecystectomy, and we recommend this block for post cholecystectomy pain relief.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nWhen people have their gallbladders removed (a surgery known as cholecystectomy), they often experience a lot of pain afterward. So, there's been a lot of focus on how to manage this pain. One method is known as a paravertebral block (PVB), which has been shown to help with pain from other types of surgeries, like thoracotomy and mastectomy. But we don't know as much about how PVB can reduce pain after gallbladder removal. Our goal here was to see if a one-time PVB injection could lessen the intensity of pain, reduce the need for strong pain medications (opioids), and extend the time before a patient needed more pain relief.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied 50 people who had their gallbladders removed in an open surgery. They were split into two groups: one group received the PVB, the other did not (they were our control group). We then looked at how bad their pain was, how much opioid medication they needed, and how long it took before they asked for more pain relief in the first 24 hours following surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found some promising results! The PVB group reported less pain 24 hours after their surgery than the control group did. They took less opioid medication and waited longer before asking for more pain relief. These differences were significant, meaning it wasn't just due to chance.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\nIn conclusion, using a single dose of PVB as part of a pain management strategy seems to provide better pain relief after gallbladder surgery compared to not using it. We believe that PVB should be used to ease the pain after gallbladder surgery.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "Cholecystectomy

"OBJECTIVE.\nThere are no randomized data to support the use of postoperative radiation for salivary gland malignancies. This study uses the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to describe the epidemiology of salivary gland cancer patients and to investigate whether treatment with adjuvant radiation improves overall survival.\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS.\nA total of 8243 patients diagnosed with a major salivary gland cancer were identified from the NCDB. All patients received primary surgical resection of their malignancy. Patients were risk-stratified by adverse features, and overall survival rates were determined. Patients were considered high risk if they had extracapsular extension and/or positive margin after resection. Patients were considered intermediate risk if they did not meet the criteria for high risk but had pT3-T4 disease, pN+ disease, lymphovascular space invasion, adenoid cystic histology, or grade 2-3 disease. Patients who did not meet criteria for high or intermediate risk were considered low risk. Overall patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment factors, and outcomes were summarized with descriptive statistics and analyzed with STATA.\n\nRESULTS.\nMedian follow-up in this cohort was 42.4 months, with the median age of 58 years. Patients in the high-risk group had greater survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; P = .002; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.91) if they received adjuvant radiation therapy. In contrast, patients in the intermediate- (HR, 1.01; P = .904; 95% CI, 0.85-1.20) and low-risk groups (HR, 0.85; P = .427; 95% CI, 0.57-1.26) did not experience a survival benefit with adjuvant radiation therapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis large analysis compared survival outcomes between observation and adjuvant radiation alone in risk-stratified patients after resection of major salivary glands using a national database. The use of adjuvant radiation for high-risk major salivary gland cancers appears to offer a survival benefit. Although an overall survival benefit was not seen in low- and intermediate-risk salivary gland cancers, this study could not address impact on local control because of the limitations of the NCDB.", "simplification": "GOAL.\nThis study looked at the overall outcomes of people who have cancer in their salivary glands (the part of the mouth that produces saliva) after surgery. The researchers wanted to see if getting additional radiation therapy after surgery would affect how long these patients lived. \n\nMETHODS.\nThey gathered information about 8243 patients who had surgery for this type of cancer. Each patient was categorized into a risk level (high, medium, or low) based on certain features of their disease (how far it had spread, cancer type, and so on). Then, the researchers tracked how long each patient lived after the operation. They used certain statistical methods to analyze the data.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe average time the researchers were able to follow up with patients was just over 42 months, and the average age was 58. The study found that patients at high risk of the disease spreading lived longer if they got radiation therapy after surgery. But, this was not the case for people at medium and low risk. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study suggests that for patients at high risk, additional radiation therapy after surgery for salivary gland cancer might help them live longer. However, it did not seem to change the survival rates for patients with medium or low risk. However, the study did not look at whether this additional treatment helped control the disease locally, which is one of the areas the researchers were unsure about, due to limitations in the original

participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nWe randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (p < 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p < 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (\u20ac437 per patient, 95% confidence interval \u2013562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of \u20ac3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval \u2013460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness-to-pay of \u20ac0 and \u20ac100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWe found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.", "simplification": "GOAL: \nWe wanted to see whether following a heart-related event, at-home fitness programs with virtual support could help more patients stick with their exercise routines and possibly get better results. \n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\nWe tried this with 90 patients who had medium or low risk for future heart issues. We divided them into two groups: one group did their rehab exercises at home with virtual support, and the other group did the same exercises but at a rehab center. \n\nWe found out that both groups stuck to their workouts equally well. However, the people who exercised at home were happier. Also, everyone in both groups got more fit after rehab and kept that up after one year, with no big difference between the two groups. \n\nExercise levels didn't change within one year. Although not statistically significant, it seemed to cost less for the healthcare system if patients exercised at home, by an average of \u20ac437 per patient. When we looked at the bigger picture, we also found that the home-based training might save more money \u2013 around \u20ac3160 per patient. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nOverall, we didn't find a big difference in fitness gains, physical activity levels, or life quality between at-home workouts with virtual help and center-based workouts. But with the folks at home, they liked their workouts more and it cost less overall. So, we believe that for patients with low-to-medium heart disease risk, using at-home workouts with virtual support works just as well as doing workouts at a rehab center.", "original_sentences":

We gave some patients the drug riociguat and others a placebo. We tested certain indicators of heart and lung function at the start of the experiment and 16 weeks later. \n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that riociguat reduced resistance to blood flow in the lungs in both groups of patients, improving their heart's ability to pump blood. The drug also reduced blood pressure in the lungs. Furthermore, patients who showed improvement in the indicators we were testing also walked longer in a 6-minute walking test, suggesting they had better overall health. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings suggest that riociguat can improve heart and lung function in patients with this non-operable chronic lung disease.

Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30\u00a0ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups. Matched pair t-tests were computed to assess differences between the vitamin D levels, CRP, UC disease activity and SIBDQ scores before and after vitamin D3 therapy using SPSS version 21.\n\nRESULTS.\nEight UC patients received 2,000 IU/daily and ten UC patients received 4,000 IU/daily of vitamin D3 for 90 days. Vitamin D levels increased after 90 days of oral vitamin D3 in both dose groups. However, the increase in vitamin D levels after 90 days of oral vitamin D3, in the 4,000 IU group was significantly higher 16.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.15 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to the 2,000 IU group of vitamin D 5.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.12 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Normal vitamin D levels (>30 ng/dl) were achieved in four out of the ten UC patients (40%) in the 4,000 IU group and in one out of the eight UC patients (12%) in the 2,000 IU group. In the group receiving 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 the increase in quality life scores (SIBDQ) was significant 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) but not in the 2,000 IU vitamin D3 group 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.87). In the 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 group the mean decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score was \u22120.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.38) compared to \u22121.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19) in the 4,000 IU vitamin D3 group but this was not statistically significant. CRP levels decreased after 90 days of daily vitamin D3 in both the 2,000 IU group and 4,000 IU group by \u22123.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4) and \u221210.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.36) respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nVitamin D3 at 4,000 IU/day is more effective than 2,000 IU/day in increasing vitamin D to sufficient levels in UC patients with hypovitaminosis D, however higher doses or treatment beyond ninety days may be required. Vitamin D3 may improve the quality of life in UC patients but clinically significant improvement is not yet established. The effect of vitamin D3 on UC disease activity is still unclear.

Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used surveys about participant\u2019s quality of life and a score system for disease severity. Lab tests were done and compared between the two groups. Researchers also checked if their vitamin D levels, inflammation, and scores changed before and after taking the vitamin D3.\n\nRESULTS:\nEight patients got 2,000 IU/daily and ten got 4,000 IU/daily of vitamin D3 for three months. Vitamin D levels went up in both groups, but more so in the group taking the higher dose. Healthy vitamin D levels were reached in four out of the ten patients (40%) in the high dose group and one out of eight patients (12%) in the low dose group. The quality of life score also improved significantly in the high dose group, but not in the low dose group. The severity scores of the disease didn\u2019t change significantly in either group. Taking vitamin D3 also seemed to lower inflammation in both groups.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nTaking 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 is more likely to increase vitamin D levels in patients with low levels of vitamin D. However, higher doses or longer time may be needed. Vitamin D3 might improve the quality of life in these patients, but it isn't proven yet. The effect on the severity of the disease is still not clear. More research is needed to better understand the impact of vitamin D in this bowel disease.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "AIM.", "start": 0, "end": 4, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "To

cancer, but the optimal radiotherapy schedule and dose remains controversial. The aim of this study was to establish a standard chemoradiotherapy treatment regimen in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe CONVERT trial was an open-label, phase 3, randomised superiority trial. We enrolled adult patients (aged \u226518 years) who had cytologically or histologically confirmed limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0\u20132, and adequate pulmonary function. Patients were recruited from 73 centres in eight countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 45 Gy radiotherapy in 30 twice-daily fractions of 1\u00b75 Gy over 19 days, or 66 Gy in 33 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy over 45 days, starting on day 22 after commencing cisplatin\u2013etoposide chemotherapy (given as four to six cycles every 3 weeks in both groups). The allocation method used was minimisation with a random element, stratified by institution, planned number of chemotherapy cycles, and performance status. Treatment group assignments were not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time from randomisation until death from any cause, analysed by modified intention-to-treat. A 12% higher overall survival at 2 years in the once-daily group versus the twice-daily group was considered to be clinically significant to show superiority of the once-daily regimen. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00433563) and is currently in follow-up.\n\nFINDINGS.\nBetween April 7, 2008, and Nov 29, 2013, 547 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive twice-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (274 patients) or once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (273 patients). Four patients (one in the twice-daily group and three in the once-daily group) did not return their case report forms and were lost to follow-up; these patients were not included in our analyses. At a median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 35\u201358), median overall survival was 30 months (95% CI 24\u201334) in the twice-daily group versus 25 months (21\u201331) in the once-daily group (hazard ratio for death in the once daily group 1\u00b718 [95% CI 0\u00b795\u20131\u00b745]; p=0\u00b714). 2-year overall survival was 56% (95% CI 50\u201362) in the twice-daily group and 51% (45\u201357) in the once-daily group (absolute difference between the treatment groups 5\u00b73% [95% CI \u22123\u00b72% to 13\u00b77%]). The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse event in patients evaluated for chemotherapy toxicity was neutropenia (197 [74%] of 266 patients in the twice-daily group vs 170 [65%] of 263 in the once-daily group). Most toxicities were similar between the groups, except there was significantly more grade 4 neutropenia with twice-daily radiotherapy (129 [49%] vs 101 [38%]; p=0\u00b705). In patients assessed for radiotherapy toxicity, was no difference in grade 3\u20134 oesophagitis between the groups (47 [19%] of 254 patients in the twice-daily group vs 47 [19%] of 246 in the once-daily group; p=0\u00b785) and grade 3\u20134 radiation pneumonitis (4 [3%] of 254 vs 4 [2%] of 246; p=0\u00b770). 11 patients died from treatment-related causes (three in the twice-daily group and eight in the once-daily group).\n\nINTERPRETATION.\nSurvival outcomes did not differ between twice-daily and once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, and toxicity was similar and lower than expected with both regimens. Since the trial was designed to show superiority of once-daily radiotherapy and was not powered to show equivalence, the implication is that twice-daily radiotherapy should continue to be considered the standard of care in this setting.\n\nFUNDING.\nCancer Research UK (Clinical Trials Awards and Advisory Committee), French Ministry of Health, Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (Cancer Research Fund, Lung Cancer, and Radiation Oncology Groups).", "simplification": "BACKGROUND:\nThis study is about finding the best treatment plan for a type of lung cancer called limited-stage small-cell lung cancer. The usual treatment is a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but it's not clear what the best way to do this is.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a trial where we gave the same group of adults two types of treatment. Every patient in the trial had the same type of lung cancer. Some patients received radiotherapy two times a day for 19 days, while others received it once a day for 45 days. Everyone also got the same chemotherapy treatment at the same time. Our goal was to see who lived longer and also noticed the side effects in both groups.\n\nFINDINGS:\nWe started the trial in 2008 with 547 patients. We lost track of 4 patients so they weren't included in our results. After about four years, people who received radiotherapy twice a day lived about 30 months on average after being diagnosed, while people who received it once a day lived about 25 months. About 56% of patients who received radiotherapy twice daily were still alive two years after diagnosis, against 51% of those who got it once daily. The side effects were similar in both groups, just more patients in the twice-a-day group had a severe decrease in white blood cell count. On an unfortunate note, 11 patients died because of the treatment.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\nThe study found that giving the treatment twice a day or once a day didn't really make a difference in how long people lived. Also, the side effects were similar for both treatment plans. For now, we should continue giving radiotherapy twice a day as the standard treatment because we designed the trial aiming to prove once-daily treatment was superior.\n\nFUNDING:\nThis study was funded by several cancer research organizations and institutes from the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Europe.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts":

healthy individuals.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe evaluated the glycemic profile in response to 4 h infusion of 500 ml of 0.9% saline versus 5% glucose solution with and without quinine at therapeutic dose (500 mg) in ten healthy volunteers (8 men) aged 28 \u00b1 9 years. The order of the fourth explorations was randomly assigned. During these explorations, we measured blood glucose every 15 min for 4 h and compared the mean and glycemic fluctuations for each test. A resting ECG was performed before and after quinine infusion in each participant.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe mean glycemic level during the 4-h infusion was 83 \u00b1 5 mg/dl without quinine versus 74 \u00b1 5 \u200b\u200bmg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) using saline solute versus 92 \u00b1 7 mg/dl without quinine versus 82 \u00b1 5 mg/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) when associated with the glucose solute. In isotonic dirty solute, quinine induces a cumulative glycemic decrease of 17.5% (p = 0.01) characterized by a nadir estimated at \u221226.5% at the 60th minute (65 \u00b1 23 mg/dl), p <0.001 followed by a gradual increase until the 4th hour. There were no signs of hypoglycemia or significant prolongation of the QT interval at the ECG. Overall, quinine did not induce a significant change in blood glucose with glucose compared to saline.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe intravenous infusion of quinine at a therapeutic dose induces a light drop in blood glucose with a significant nadir at the 60th minute in the healthy subject without hypoglycemia. This suggests the need for close monitoring in patients at risk of hypoglycemia such as those with severe malaria especially during the first hour of quinine infusion.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study was conducted to see how quinine, a medication used for malaria, affects blood sugar levels in healthy people.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested blood sugar responses to a 4-hour dose of saline (salt) solution or a glucose (sugar) solution, with and without quinine. We used ten healthy volunteers, mainly men, averaging 28 years old. The experiments were conducted in a random order. In each experiment, we checked the blood sugar every 15 minutes for 4 hours and compared the average and changes in blood sugar for each test. We also performed a resting ECG (a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat) before and after giving quinine to each participant.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe average blood sugar level during the 4-hour test was slightly lower with quinine than without it, both in the salt and sugar solutions. The largest drop (17.5%) occurred at the 60th minute but then it gradually increased until the 4th hour. There were no indications of too low blood sugar or significant heart rhythm changes as shown by the ECG. Overall, quinine didn't cause a significant change in blood sugar levels compared to the saline solution.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nGiving quinine through IV at a normal dose resulted in a small drop in blood sugar levels, which hit its lowest point at the 60th minute in healthy people. There were no signs of dangerously low blood sugar. This implies that patients at risk of low blood sugar levels, such as those with severe malaria, should be watched closely during the first hour of quinine treatment.", "original_sentences":

mortality. Nanoparticles (< 100 nm) are likely candidates for triggering inflammatory responses and activation of coagulation pathways because of their ability to enter lung cells and pass bronchial mucosa. We tested the hypothesis that bronchial segmental instillation of carbon nanoparticles causes inflammation and activation of coagulation pathways in healthy humans in vivo.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis was an investigator-initiated, randomized controlled, dose-escalation study in 26 healthy males. Participants received saline (control) in one lung segment and saline (placebo) or carbon nanoparticles 10 \u03bcg, 50 \u03bcg, or 100 \u03bcg in the contra-lateral lung. Six hours later, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for inflammation and coagulation parameters.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was a significant dose-dependent increase in blood neutrophils (p = 0.046) after challenge with carbon nanoparticles. The individual top-dose of 100 \u03bcg showed a significant (p = 0.05) increase in terms of percentage neutrophils in blood as compared to placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study shows a dose-dependent effect of bronchial segmental challenge with carbon nanoparticles on circulating neutrophils of healthy volunteers. This suggests that nanoparticles in the respiratory tract induce systemic inflammation.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDutch Trial Register no. 2976. 11 July 2011. http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2976\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12890-017-0463-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nBreathing in tiny pieces of dust in the air, or air pollution, is linked with greater risks of illness and death. Extra-small particles, termed nanoparticles, may cause health problems like inflammation and blood clotting because they can enter lung cells and pass through lung mucus. We tested the idea that purposely putting carbon nanoparticles in certain areas of the lungs can cause inflammation and trigger blood clotting in healthy people.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe ran a study where we controlled the amount of carbon nanoparticles we gave to 26 healthy men. These participants had saltwater (a control substance) put in one part of their lungs and either more saltwater (a placebo) or different amounts of carbon nanoparticles in the other part. After 6 hours, we collected samples of their blood and washings from lung fluid to test for signs of inflammation and blood clotting.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that the more carbon nanoparticles we used, the more white blood cells (cells that fight infection) appeared in the blood samples. Additionally, using the highest amount of nanoparticles caused a significant increase in these cells compared to using the placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis study shows that purposely sending carbon nanoparticles into certain parts of the lungs of healthy people can increase the number of infection-fighting cells in their blood. This suggests that small particles in the lungs can cause body-wide inflammation.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis study was registered with the Dutch Trial Register on July 11, 2011.

in patients with meniscal pathology and osteoarthritis (OA), under normal clinical practice conditions.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nWe conducted a prospective, randomized, evaluator-blind, pilot study. After arthroscopy, patients were randomized to receive 1) five injections of HA1 (Suprahyal\u00ae/Adant\u00ae); 2) four injections of HA2 (Orthovisc\u00ae); 3) three injections of HA3 (Synvisc\u00ae); 4) a single injection of PRP (GPSTM II); or 5) standard care (control). Patients were followed up for 18 months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Minimally Clinical Important Improvement (MCII), as relative improvement \u226520 for pain and function, was also calculated.\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty patients were included. At early follow-up (3 months), total WOMAC scores improved in all groups compared to baseline with reductions of 44.79% (HA1), 24.02% (HA2), 40.38% (HA3), 39.77% (PRP), and 27.64% (control) (p=0.002 HA1 compared to HA2). At 18 months, the higher improvement in total WOMAC was in HA1 with a 65.20% reduction, followed by PRP (55.01%), HA3 (49.57%), and HA2 (29.82%), whereas the control group had a 14.55% increase over baseline (p=0.001 control compared to HA1 and HA3). The percentage of patients achieving the MCII for both pain and function at 18 months was 100% (HA1), 80% (HA3), 60% (HA2), and 60% (PRP), whereas, in the control group, all patients returned to pre-arthroscopy levels. There were no adverse events attributable to surgery or to intraarticular administration.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nViscosupplementation following arthroscopy is more effective than PRP in adequately selected patients with meniscal lesions occurring concomitantly with OA.

The treatments tested include viscosupplementation (injection of a gel-like substance into the knee) or platelet-rich plasma (concentrated blood cells that might help healing), and standard care. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nWe carried out a study where the patients did not know which treatment they were getting. After the knee surgery, patients were randomly chosen to receive one of these treatments: five injections of HA1 (a type of gel), four injections of HA2 (another type of gel), three injections of HA3 (yet another gel type), a single injection of PRP (a substance taken from the patient's own blood), or standard care. Patients were checked up on for 18 months. We measured pain and function using a standard questionnaire (WOMAC) and tracked if there was a 20% or more improvement in symptoms.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe included 50 patients in the study. After the first 3 months, all groups showed improvement compared to how they felt at the start. The group which received HA1 injections showed the best results, with 65% improvement after 18 months, followed by the PRP group, other HA injections, and lastly the standard care group. All patients in the HA1 group achieved 20% or more improvement in both pain and function at 18 months. No side effects were linked to the surgery or injections.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nViscosupplementation after knee surgery is more effective than platelet-rich plasma for patients with meniscal damage and osteoarthritis.

procedures.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nTo compare outcomes between 2 volumizing hyaluronic acid fillers.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nSubjects with moderate-to-severe volume loss in the cheeks were randomized in a split-face design to malar enhancement with Cohesive Polydensified Matrix 26 mg/ml HA (CPM-26) and Vycross 20 mg/ml HA (VYC-20). The same injection technique and injection volume were applied for both sides of the face. Anesthetics, overcorrection, and touch-ups were not permitted. Blinded subjects assessed aesthetic improvements using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale and treatment satisfaction by confirming their willingness to repeat treatment or recommend it to friends. Follow-up was 18 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 45 subjects received a single 2 mL injection of CPM-26 on one side and VYC-20 on the contralateral side of the face. The proportion of subjects reporting improvement on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale compared with baseline for CPM-26 and VYC-20 was 97.7% and 88.6%, respectively, at 3 months, 73.8% and 71.1% at 12 months, and 61.0% and 56.7% at 18 months. Treatment satisfaction was high, with the majority of subjects stating that they would repeat treatment and recommend it to friends, but at each time point, a higher proportion of subjects was more satisfied with the CPM-26-treated side of the face.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn this first direct comparison of CPM-26 and VYC-20, the majority of subjects were satisfied with both treatments throughout the study.

The same amount of filler was used on both sides of the face, without using any extra anesthetics, fillers or touch-ups later. People were then asked to judge how much better they looked and whether they were happy with the treatment and would use it again or suggest it to others. The study followed up with them for 18 months.\n\nRESULTS.\n45 people took part in the research and received a single injection of 2ml of each filler on both sides of the face. When they compared their looks before and after the treatment, at 3 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years, more people were pleased with the results of CPM-26. They were also more likely to say they would use the same treatment again or recommend it to friends. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFirst-time comparison of these two fillers shows that most people were happy with both of them.

determine the effects of carbonated water on etched or sealed enamel according to the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions.\n\nMETHODS.\nCarbonated water with different carbonation levels was manufactured by a soda carbonator. Seventy-five premolar teeth were randomly divided into a control group and 4 experimental groups in accordance with the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions in the test solutions. After specimen preparation of the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups, all the specimens were submerged in each test solution for 15 minutes three times a day during 7 days. Microhardness tests on the Unexposed and Etched enamel subgroups were performed with 10 specimens from each group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests on the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups were performed with 5 specimens from each group. Microhardness changes in different groups were statistically compared using paired t-tests, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe microhardness changes were significantly different between the groups (p = 0.000). The microhardness changes in all experimental groups except Group 3 (low-level carbonated water with calcium ions) were significantly greater than those in the Control group. SEM showed that etched areas of the specimen were affected by carbonated water and the magnitude of destruction varied between groups. Adhesive material was partially removed in groups exposed to carbonated water.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nCarbonated water has negative effects on etched or sealed enamel, resulting in decreased microhardness and removal of the adhesive material.", "simplification": "GOAL:\nWe wanted to see how fizzy water affects the hard outer layer of your teeth, which we call 'enamel'. We also wanted to figure out whether the effect changes based on how fizzy the water is and whether or not it contains calcium.\n\nWHAT WE DID:\nWe made fizzy water with different levels of carbonation. We then took 75 pre-molar teeth and split them into a control group and four test groups. The groups were divided based on the fizziness of the water and whether or not it contained calcium. The first group was not exposed to anything, the second had its enamel etched (like being scratched), and the third was sealed. This process took place over seven days, with each group submerged in the fizzy water for fifteen minutes, three times a day. After that, we tested the hardness of the enamel and looked at the enamel under a high-powered microscope, using a selection of teeth from each group.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nEnamel hardness changed significantly across the groups. In all test groups, the hardness of the enamel decreased more than in the control group, except in the group exposed to lightly fizzy water with calcium. We found that fizzy water destroyed the etched areas of the teeth and the extent of this destruction differed between groups. The fizzy water also partially removed a sticky material we applied to the teeth.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS:\nOur research shows that fizzy water can harm the tough enamel layer of your teeth, making it softer and removing applied adhesive. The harm varies depending on how fizzy the water is and whether it contains calcium.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE.", "start": 0, "end": 10, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "The purpose

questions remain regarding the comparative efficacy of amphetamine- and methylphenidate-based agents.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nOur objective was to describe two acute randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, head-to-head studies of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) in adolescents with ADHD.\n\nMETHODS.\nAdolescents (13\u201317 years) diagnosed with ADHD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria were enrolled in an 8-week flexible-dose study [LDX 30\u201370 mg/day (n = 186 randomized); OROS-MPH 18\u201372 mg/day (n = 185 randomized); placebo (n = 93 randomized)] or a 6-week forced-dose study [LDX 70 mg/day (n = 219 randomized); OROS-MPH 72 mg/day (n = 220 randomized); placebo (n = 110 randomized)]. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score changes from baseline (primary endpoint) at week 8 (flexible-dose study) or week 6 (forced-dose study) were assessed with mixed-effects models for repeated measures. Secondary endpoints included improvement on the dichotomized Clinical Global Impressions\u2013Improvement scale (CGI-I; key secondary endpoint) and changes from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV subscales. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.\n\nRESULTS.\nLeast squares (LS) mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) ADHD-RS-IV total score changes from baseline to end of treatment were \u221217.0 \u00b1 1.03 with placebo, \u221225.4 \u00b1 0.74 with LDX, and \u221222.1 \u00b1 0.73 with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study and \u221213.4 \u00b1 1.19 with placebo, \u221225.6 \u00b1 0.82 with LDX, and \u221223.5 \u00b1 0.80 with OROS-MPH in the flexible-dose study. LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment difference for the change from baseline significantly favored LDX over OROS-MPH in the forced-dose [\u22123.4 \u00b1 1.04, p = 0.0013, effect size (ES) \u22120.33] but not the flexible-dose (\u22122.1 \u00b1 1.15, p = 0.0717, ES \u22120.20) study. The percentage of improved participants on the dichotomized CGI-I at end of treatment was significantly greater with LDX than with OROS-MPH in the forced-dose study (81.4 vs. 71.3%, p = 0.0188) but not the flexible-dose study (LDX 83.1%, OROS-MPH 81.0%, p = 0.6165). The LS mean \u00b1 SEM treatment differences for change from baseline on the ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscales nominally favored LDX in the forced-dose study (hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.49, nominal p = 0.0081, ES \u22120.27; inattentiveness subscale \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.63, nominal p = 0.0013, ES \u22120.33), but there were no significant differences between active treatments in the flexible-dose study. In both studies, LDX and OROS-MPH were superior to placebo for all efficacy-related endpoints (all nominal p < 0.0001; ES range \u22120.43 to \u22121.16). The overall frequency of TEAEs for LDX and OROS-MPH, respectively, were 66.5 and 58.9% in the forced-dose study and 83.2 and 82.1% in the flexible-dose study. TEAEs occurring in \u2265 5% of participants that were also reported at two or more times the rate of placebo were decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, initial insomnia, dry mouth, and nasopharyngitis (LDX and OROS-MPH), irritability and dizziness (LDX only), and increased heart rate (OROS-MPH only) in the forced-dose study and decreased appetite, decreased weight, insomnia, and dizziness (LDX and OROS-MPH) and dry mouth and upper abdominal pain (LDX only) in the flexible-dose study. Mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) increases from baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) were observed in the forced-dose study [LDX 1.6 \u00b1 9.65 and 3.3 \u00b1 8.11 mmHg, 6.7 \u00b1 12.78 beats per minute (bpm); OROS-MPH 2.6 \u00b1 10.15 and 3.3 \u00b1 9.13 mmHg, 7.6 \u00b1 12.47 bpm] and the flexible-dose study (LDX 2.4 \u00b1 9.46 and 2.8 \u00b1 8.41 mmHg, 4.7 \u00b1 11.82 bpm; OROS-MPH 0.4 \u00b1 9.90 and 2.2 \u00b1 8.64 mmHg, 6.0 \u00b1 10.52 bpm) at the last on-treatment assessment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLDX was superior to OROS-MPH in adolescents with ADHD in the forced-dose but not the flexible-dose study. Safety and tolerability for both medications was consistent with previous studies. These findings underscore the robust acute efficacy of both psychostimulant classes in treating adolescents with ADHD.\n\nCLINICALTRIALS.GOV REGISTRY NUMBERS.\nNCT01552915 and NCT01552902.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40263-017-0468-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis research looks at the effectiveness of certain drugs that are typically used for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in young people. The study particularly compares two drugs: lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH).\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nWe studied and compared the effects of LDX and OROS-MPH on ADHD symptoms in teenagers.\n\nMETHODS.\nTeenagers diagnosed with ADHD participated in two separate studies. In one 8-week study, the dose was flexible and in another 6-week study, the dose was fixed. We measured the changes in their ADHD symptoms at the end of each study. We also tracked any side effects as well as their vital signs.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe results showed that both LDX and OROS-MPH improved ADHD symptoms more than a placebo (a dummy pill). But, LDX had a slightly better result in the fixed-dose study, whereas in the flexible-dose study, there wasn't much difference between LDX and OROS-MPH. We also found common side effects, including loss of appetite, weight loss, sleep problems, dry mouth, and minor infections. The drugs also slightly increased blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings show that LDX was more effective than OROS-MPH in the fixed-dose study, but not in the flexible-dose study. Both drugs were safe and similar findings have been reported in previous studies. Both types of drugs were effective in treating ADHD symptoms in teenagers.\n\nACCESS TO MORE MATERIAL.\nYou can find additional material related to this article online if you're authorized.

by the subtests of the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III (WCJ-III) assessment, predicts listening-effort performance during dual tasks across the adults of varying ages.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nParticipants were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 14 listeners (number of females\u2009=\u200911) who were 41\u201361 years old [mean\u2009=\u200953.18; standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u20095.97]. Group 2 consisted of 15 listeners (number of females\u2009=\u20099) who were 63\u201381 years old (mean\u2009=\u200972.07; SD\u2009=\u20095.11). Participants were administered the WCJ-III Memory for Words, Auditory Working Memory, Visual Matching, and Decision Speed subtests. All participants were tested in each of the following three dual-task experimental conditions, which were varying in complexity: (1) auditory word recognition\u2009+\u2009visual processing, (2) auditory working memory (word)\u2009+\u2009visual processing, and (3) auditory working memory (sentence)\u2009+\u2009visual processing in noise.\n\nRESULTS.\nA repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that task complexity significantly affected the performance measures of auditory accuracy, visual accuracy, and processing speed. Linear regression revealed that the cognitive subtests of the WCJ-III test significantly predicted performance across dependent variable measures.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nListening effort is significantly affected by task complexity, regardless of age. Performance on the WCJ-III test may predict listening effort in adults and may assist speech-language pathologist (SLPs) to understand challenges faced by participants when subjected to noise.", "simplification": "PURPOSE.\nThis study aims to establish if a test we often use to assess thinking skills can also help us understand how hard adults of different ages find it to listen and do something else at the same time.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe had two groups of volunteers. The first group, made up of 14 people mostly women (11 out of 14), were aged between 41 and 61 years. The second group had 15 people, only nine women, aged between 63 and 81. We asked these people to do a few tests from the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III. This is an assessment tool we typically use to evaluate how the brain processes information. Then our volunteers had to do two tasks at the same time. These tasks were a bit different for each round, but the idea was always the same: listen to something while also watching something.\n\nRESULTS.\nLooking at the results, it became clear that the difficulty of the task influences how well people did in terms of hearing accurately, seeing accurately, and how quickly they processed information. Additionally, the certain thinking-related subtests from the taken test could potentially help predict how well people performed in complex tests.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIt turns out that the more difficult the task, the harder it can be for anyone, regardless of their age, to listen and do another task at the same time. Also, the better someone does on the specific Woodcock\u2013Johnson III test, the easier they might find doing two things at once.

radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using cooled-wet electrodes and switching monopolar (SM) RFA using separable clustered (SC) electrodes in patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThis prospective study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Between April 2014 and January 2015, sixty-nine patients with 74 HCCs were randomly treated with RFA using either internally cooled-wet (ICW) electrodes in SB mode (SB-RFA, n = 36) or SC electrodes in SM mode (SM-RFA, n = 38). Technical parameters including the number of ablations, ablation time, volume, energy delivery, and complications were evaluated. Thereafter, 1-year and 2-year local tumor progression (LTP) free survival rates were compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn the SB-RFA group, less number of ablations were required (1.72\u00b10.70 vs. 2.31\u00b11.37, P = 0.039), the ablation time was shorter (10.9\u00b13.9 vs.14.3\u00b15.0 min, p = 0.004), and energy delivery was smaller (13.1\u00b16.3 vs.23.4\u00b112.8 kcal, p<0.001) compared to SM-RFA. Ablation volume was not significantly different between SB-RFA and SM-RFA groups (61.8\u00b124.3 vs.54.9\u00b123.7 cm3, p = 0.229). Technical failure occurred in one patient in the SM-RFA group, and major complications occurred in one patient in each group. The 1-year and 2-year LTP free survival rates were 93.9% and 84.3% in the SB-RFA group and 94.4% and 88.4% in the SM-RFA group (p = 0.687).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth SB-RFA using ICW electrodes and SM-RFA using SC electrodes provided comparable LTP free survival rates although SB-RFA required less ablations and shorter ablation time.", "simplification": "GOAL:\nWe ran a study to compare two methods of a treatment called radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for people with liver cancer. One method uses something called switching bipolar (SB) RFA with cooled-wet electrodes, the other uses switching monopolar (SM) RFA with separable clustered electrodes.\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe got the go-ahead from our ethics board for this study. From April 2014 to January 2015, we randomly selected 69 patients with liver cancer to undergo one of the two RFA methods we're comparing. Parameters like how many treatments were needed, how long each treatment lasted, energy used, side-effects and the benefits of the treatment were tracked for each patient. We then compared how many patients remained without cancer after 1 and 2 years between the two groups.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nThe group who underwent SB-RFA needed fewer treatments, each treatment went quicker, and required less energy compared to the SM-RFA group. There was no significant difference in overall treatment volume between the two groups. There was one technical issue with the SM-RFA method, and there was one major side effect in each group. Yet, the two-year cancer-free rates were nearly the same for both groups (about 84-88% remained cancer-free).\n\nCONCLUSION:\nBoth methods had similar cancer-free rates after 2 years, however, the SB-RFA treatment method was quicker and needed fewer sessions.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "OBJECTIVE.", "start": 0, "end": 10, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "A randomized controlled trial was

Despite reports of stigma by sexual violence survivors, limited evidence exists on effective strategies to reduce stigma, particularly in conflict-affected settings. We sought to assess the effect of group Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) on stigma and the extent to which stigma might moderate the effectiveness of CPT in treating mental health problems among survivors of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMETHODS.\nData were drawn from 405 adult female survivors of sexual violence reporting mental distress and poor functioning in North and South Kivu. Women were recruited through organizations providing psychosocial support and then cluster randomized to group CPT or individual support. Women were assessed at baseline, the end of treatment, and again six months later. Assessors were masked to women's treatment assignment. Linear mixed-effect regression models were used to estimate (1) the effect of CPT on feelings of perceived and internalized (felt) stigma, and (2) whether felt stigma and discrimination (enacted stigma) moderated the effects of CPT on combined depression and anxiety symptoms, posttraumatic stress, and functional impairment.\n\nRESULTS.\nParticipants receiving CPT experienced moderate reductions in felt stigma relative to those in individual support (Cohen's D = 0.44, p = value = 0.02) following the end of treatment, though this difference was no longer significant six-months later (Cohen's D = 0.45, p = value = 0.12). Neither felt nor enacted stigma significantly moderated the effect of CPT on mental health symptoms or functional impairment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nGroup cognitive-behavioral based therapies may be an effective stigma reduction tool for survivors of sexual violence. Experiences and perceptions of stigma did not hinder therapeutic effects of group psychotherapy on survivors' mental health.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01385163.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13031-018-0142-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND:\nSexual violence can cause major physical, emotional, and social problems. Survivors sometimes feel negatively judged or stigmatized, but we're not sure how to best help them overcome this. We decided to test a group therapy approach, called Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), to see if it helps reduce stigma. Also, we wanted to see if feeling stigmatized affected how well the therapy worked for mental health issues. We did this study in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe collected data from 405 adult women who survived sexual violence and were dealing with mental distress and trouble in daily life. In partnership with local support organizations, we randomly assigned these women to either group therapy or individual support. We checked on their progress at the start, the end, and six months after the therapy. We used statistical models to see if the therapy reduced feelings of stigma, and if stigma affected how well the therapy worked on other mental health issues.\n\nRESULTS:\nWomen who went through group therapy felt less stigmatized after therapy, compared to those with individual support. However, this feeling faded away six months after the therapy. Neither feeling stigmatized nor experiencing discrimination significantly changed how well the therapy worked on mental health issues.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nGroup therapy could be a good way to help survivors of sexual violence feel less stigmatized. Also, feeling stigmatized or discriminated didn't negatively affect how well the therapy worked on improving mental health.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nThis trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov

total dose of propofol consumed without compromising the safety and recovery of patients having endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).\n\nMETHODS.\nA total of 210 adult patients undergoing elective EUS under sedation were included in the study. Patients were randomized into three groups. Patients were premedicated intravenously with normal saline in group 1, 50 \u00b5g fentanyl in group 2, and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine in group 3. All patients received intravenous propofol for sedation. Propofol consumption in mg/kg/h was noted. The incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, desaturation, and coughing was noted. The time to achieve a Post Anesthesia Discharge Score (PADS) of 10 was also noted.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were 68 patients in group 1, 70 in group 2, and 72 in group 3. The amount of propofol consumed was significantly higher in group 1 (9.25 [7.3\u201313.2]) than in group 2 (8.8 [6.8\u201312.2]) and group 3 (7.6 [5.7\u20139.8]). Patient hemodynamics and oxygenation were well maintained and comparable in all groups. The time to achieve a PADS of 10 was significantly higher in group 3 compared to the other two groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of 50 \u00b5g fentanyl or 0.5 mg/kg ketamine in a single dose during EUS reduces the dose of propofol required for sedation. However, unlike the addition of fentanyl, the addition of ketamine increased the time to recovery. Thus, 50 \u00b5g fentanyl is a good additive to propofol infusion for sedation during EUS to reduce the requirement for propofol without affecting the time to recovery.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND:\nWe wanted to see if using a small dose of either ketamine or fentanyl could lower the amount of propofol needed when putting people to sleep for a certain type of ultrasound scan. We also wanted to make sure this wouldn't affect the safety of the patients or how long it took them to wake up from the anaesthesia.\n\nMETHODS: \nWe ran a test with 210 adults who were going to have this ultrasound scan where you have to be sedated. We divided them into three groups. Group 1 received only a harmless saltwater solution as a control, Group 2 received a small dose of fentanyl, and Group 3 got a small amount of ketamine. Everybody also got the usual sedative, propofol. We measured how much of this sedative each group required. We also noted if they had any reactions like low blood pressure, slow heart rate, trouble breathing, or coughing, and how long it took for them to be lucid enough to be sent home.\n\nRESULTS:\nGroup 1 had 68 patients, Group 2 had 70, and Group 3 had 72. The first group needed more of the propofol than the other two groups. Regardless of which treatment they received, everyone's blood flow and oxygen levels were fine. However, the patients who'd received the ketamine took longer to be awake and alert enough to leave.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nUsing a little bit of either fentanyl or ketamine when this type of ultrasound is happening can lower the amount of the usual sedative needed. But, if we use ketamine, it took the patients longer to wake up enough to go home. We found that a small dose of fentanyl could be a good add-on to the propofol sedative during this procedure. This can lower the amount propofol we need to use, but it doesn't make it take any longer for patients to be ready to go home.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end":

Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.\n\nAIM.\nThe aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nOne hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.\n\nRESULTS.\nSynergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%\u201399% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups.

Up to now, there hasn't been a universal treatment for this type of tooth sensitivity, though some doctors have been using various methods, including laser treatments.\n\nAIM.\nThe goal of this study was to find a way to treat tooth sensitivity using the smallest amount possible of a particular chemical and a low level of laser energy, and then keep track of those patients for a long period of time. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nOne hundred and twenty patients were randomly split into four groups: one group was treated with potassium nitrate; a second group had a procedure done with a specific type of laser; a third group both received the chemical and the laser treatment; the fourth group received a placebo or fake treatment. They measured the levels of the patients' tooth sensitivity by asking them to describe their pain before and after the treatment. This was done using tests with different materials and temperatures over a period of 6 weeks. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe group where we combined the chemical and laser treatment (Group 3) reported a significant decrease in their tooth sensitivity. In fact, by the 6th week, almost all of the patients in that group no longer felt the pain (97%-99% of them reported relief). This group performed better than the other treatment groups. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nConsidering these results, using a combination of low-dose potassium nitrate and laser treatment seems to be an effective

"BACKGROUND.\nIt has been suggested that liraglutide could have an impact on glucose and lipid metabolism disorder and adhesion molecule activation, which may play important roles in the vascular damage of diabetes. In this study, we examined the effects of liraglutide versus metformin on non-esterified free fatty acids, beta-cell insulin secretion, and adhesion molecule levels in patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn this study, 60 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 33.97\u2009\u00b1\u20095.67\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide or oral metformin. Before the study and after the 8-week treatment period, a 75\u00a0g oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Plasma glucose, lipids and lipoprotein, plasma insulin, glycaemic and insulin responses, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter 8\u00a0weeks, 120\u00a0min of NEFA (155\u2009\u00b1\u2009125 vs 99\u2009\u00b1\u200973\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.026) and the levels of sVCAM-1 (465\u2009\u00b1\u2009136 vs 382\u2009\u00b1\u2009131\u00a0ng/ml, P\u2009=\u20090.013) significantly decreased, while the early phase insulin secretion index (24.94 [7.78, 38.89] vs. 31.13 [17.67, 59.09], P\u2009=\u20090.031), fasting plasma insulin (104 [51, 123] vs 113 [54, 171]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.015), 60\u00a0min plasma insulin (326 [165, 441] vs 471 [334, 717]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.005), 120\u00a0min plasma insulin (401 [193, 560] vs 500 [367, 960]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.047), and insulin area under the curve (AUCins) (648 [321, 742] vs 738 [451, 1118]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.005) remarkably increased for patients in the liraglutide treatment group. The levels of sVCAM-1 dramatically decreased after 8\u00a0weeks of liraglutide treatment (503\u2009\u00b1\u2009182 vs 382\u2009\u00b1\u2009131\u00a0ng/ml, P\u2009=\u20090.046) compared to that of the metformin treatment group. At the same time, the differences before and after liraglutide treatment in 120\u00a0min of NEFA (\u2212\u200932 [\u2212\u200996, \u2212\u20095] vs 5 [\u2212\u200935, 38]\u00a0\u00b5mol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.033) and AUCins (738 [451, 1118] vs 594 [357, 1216]\u00a0mIU/L, P\u2009=\u20090.014) were remarkably enhanced compared to that of the metformin therapy. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in fasting NEFA after liraglutide or metformin treatment. The reduction of 120\u00a0min NEFA (\u0394NEFA) was positively correlated with the decrease of sVCAM-1 (\u0394sVCAM-1) after 8\u00a0weeks of liraglutide treatment (r\u2009=\u20090.523, P\u2009=\u20090.003).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results demonstrate that liraglutide administration is more effective than metformin in reducing 120\u00a0min NEFA and suppressing sVCAM-1 levels for recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. We suggest that this outcome may be because liraglutide is associated with potentiating insulin secretion capacity, inhibiting vascular inflammatory cytokines, and antagonizing atherosclerosis.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12933-018-0701-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at how a drug called liraglutide might help treat type 2 diabetes. We wanted to see if it could improve how the body uses sugar and fats. We also wanted to see if the drug could reduce damage to the blood vessels, which is a common complication of diabetes. We compared the effects of liraglutide to another popular diabetes medication, metformin.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested 60 people who had just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Half of them were given liraglutide and the other half were given metformin. We did a sugar tolerance test before the study and after 8 weeks of treatment. We also measured levels of different substances in their blood, such as glucose, fats, insulin, and a particular molecule associated with blood vessel damage.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter 8 weeks, those given liraglutide showed a good improvement. Their blood showed less of the harmful fats and of the molecule linked to blood vessel damage, and more insulin (which helps regulate sugar in the body). This group also had a better response to the sugar tolerance test. The people who took metformin didn't seem to improve as much.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLiraglutide seems to be a better option than metformin for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. It appears to help the body better manage sugar and fats, and it may reduce blood vessel inflammation and the risk of hardening of the arteries.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.",

Children from multicultural families face physical, social, mental, and intellectual hurdles; however, relative interventions are lacking in South Korea (hereafter Korea) in this regard. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of regular Taekwondo (TKD) training on physical fitness, mood, sociability, and cognitive functions in these children. Methods: This study included 30 children from multicultural families in Korea who were randomly assigned to a TKD group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). The children in TKD group underwent 16 weeks of TKD training once a week for 60 min. Each participant underwent a basic fitness test and sociability questionnaire before and after the intervention. Furthermore, we examined the changes in the mood and cognitive function by determining the profile of mood states (POMS), and Stroop color and word test, respectively. Results: Results of the Stork test of balance were significantly higher in the TKD group after intervention (p < 0.05). In terms of sub-variables, POMS, tension, and depression scores were significantly lower (p < 0.05) after the intervention, while the vigor score was significantly higher in the intervention group than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, sociability and 'being left out' score, a sub-variable of sociability, was significantly lower (p < 0.05) after the intervention, while sociability score was significantly higher (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that participation in regular TKD training can be effective for balanced improvements in variables of basic fitness and that it exerts a positive effect on the mood and development of sociability.", "simplification": "Purpose: In South Korea, children from families with diverse cultural backgrounds often face challenges regarding their physical, social, mental, and intellectual development. Not enough action is taken to see if activities like Taekwondo can improve these areas. We wanted to find out if regular Taekwondo classes can improve fitness, mood, social skills, and thinking abilities in these children. \n\nMethods: For our study, we had 30 children from multicultural families. We divided them into two groups: 15 children attended Taekwondo sessions once a week for 16 weeks, and the other 15 children didn't. We measured their fitness levels and how well they socialize by using questionnaires before and after the Taekwondo classes. We also evaluated changes in their mood and ability to think by examining their state of mind and their performance in a color and word test. \n\nResults: The balance of the children who participated in Taekwondo improved significantly. They experienced less tension and depression, as well as increased energy levels compared to the other group. Their social skills also improved, and they felt less left out after the Taekwondo program. \n\nConclusions: The results suggest that regular Taekwondo training can improve basic fitness levels, mood,

The gel in question contains a substance called Griffithsin (GRFT), which helps fight against viruses. \n\nIn our study, we tested the gel on six macaque monkeys. We applied two different versions of the gel and compared these to a dummy gel (placebo). We studied samples from the monkeys to see what effects the gel had on proteins and microbes (tiny organisms that live in our bodies). \n\nWe found that the Griffithsin gel didn't significantly change protein levels at any point. However, it did increase the levels of two helpful types of microbes after 24 hours. On the other hand, the dummy gels caused changes in proteins linked to immunity and inflammation after 2 hours, and also increased beneficial microbes after 24 hours. \n\nIn plain terms, our study shows that the Griffithsin gel doesn't harm the rectum's proteins or microbes, implying it's safe to use. However, it's important to note that even the dummy gels can cause changes to the rectum's proteins and microbes.

were 65 years and older. The most effective diabetes prevention method in prediabetic adults is lifestyle modification. However, despite the benefits of lifestyle change, diabetes prevalence continues to increase. Maintaining a regular exercise routine and a healthy eating plan may be difficult because of the negative emotional barriers (i.e., stress, mood) that a prediabetic individual faces. This is particularly evident in older individuals when you combine that with decreases in mobility and geriatric syndromes. A potential treatment for these emotional barriers is a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). In the current study, the group included 154 participants, both men and women, ranging between the ages of 41 to 71 years old. The study design was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group study. The Psychosocial Depressive Symptoms Questionnaire (PDS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to examine the effect of two doses of 5-ALA (15 mg and 50 mg) on various components of mood (i.e., hopefulness, loneliness, and motivation) and coping ability. Using SAS software, an ordered logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between the dose groups (control, 15 mg, and 50 mg) and the responses to the two questionnaires, the PDS and PSS, used in this study. An integrative literature review, using the PubMed database, searched for studies on the relationship between 5-ALA administration and mood and coping ability. Our literature review resulted in zero published articles. Next, we found that the intake of 5-ALA was significantly associated with improved coping ability (p = 0.004) and improved self-perception of effort spent (p = 0.002). Finally, we found a significant dose-dependent relationship for the association of 5-ALA intake on measures of effort (p = 0.003), loneliness (p = 0.006), and coping ability (p = 0.003). The 50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose in improving these measures. In conclusion, after 12 weeks of taking 5-ALA, we found significant improvements in self-perception of effort spent, loneliness, and coping ability in prediabetic middle age and older adults. Improved mood and coping ability may allow prediabetic individuals to overcome the emotional obstacles preventing them from maintaining a healthy lifestyle and ultimately, help them to avoid the development of diabetes.", "simplification": "In 2010, around 79 million Americans, over half of whom were over 65, had a condition called prediabetes. The best way to prevent this condition turning into full diabetes is through lifestyle changes, like maintaining a regular exercise routine and eating healthy foods. However, these changes can be tough due to emotional struggles such as stress and low mood, particularly in older people who also face mobility issues.\n\nOur study investigated if a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) could help. We ran a trial with 154 people, both men and women aged between 41 and 71, who were randomly selected to receive either no supplement, a 15 mg dose, or a 50 mg dose. We also checked their mood and stress levels. We found no previous research on this topic.\n\nThe results showed that taking 5-ALA helped improve people's ability to cope and how they felt about the effort they were making, and it reduced feelings of loneliness. The 50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose. After 12 weeks of taking the supplement, people's mood and coping abilities were much better. \n\nThis could be a breakthrough for prediabetic individuals, as it could help them overcome the emotional struggles that often get in the way of them adopting healthier habits, ultimately assisting them in preventing full diabetes.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "In 2010, approximately 79 million

chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency (TC-RF) tonsil ablation with CO2-laser cryptolysis (CO2-LC) in the treatment of patients with halitosis caused by CCT.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nSixty-two patients who suffered from halitosis and/or foreign body sensation due to CCT were enrolled in the present randomized clinical trial, and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A underwent TC-RF tonsil ablation and Group B received CO2-LC. The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. Patient pain levels and amount of bleeding were evaluated as safety outcome measures. Pain levels were evaluated during the intervention, and at Day 1, 3, and 7 following the procedure using a visual analog scale (VAS).\n\nRESULTS.\nMean rank of pain score in the RF tonsil ablation group was found to be higher than in the CO2-LC group at all measured timepoints following the procedure. The amount of bleeding in the LC group was found to be significantly less than in the RF group (P<0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding duration of procedure (P=0.157).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth procedures were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of CT-associated halitosis.

This study aimed to compare two treatments: one using controlled temperature radio waves and the other using a type of laser, to treat bad breath caused by this condition.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe had 62 people in the study who had bad breath and/or these feelings from their throat issue. They were split into two groups. One group received the treatment with radio waves and the other with the laser. We monitored how severe the symptoms were after a week, a month, and then six months after treatment. We also noted any pain suffered and any bleeding as measures of how safe it was. The pain was measured when the treatment was happening and on days 1, 3, and 7 after the treatment using a rating scale.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that the group treated with radio waves suffered more pain than the laser group at all times we checked after the procedure. The laser group had less bleeding than the radio wave group, a significant difference. However, the time for both procedures to complete wasn't significantly different.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth treatments were found to be effective and safe for treating chronic tonsillitis-associated bad breath. However, the laser showed better results as it caused less pain, less bleeding, and allowed patients to return to their normal diet sooner.", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "INTRODUCTION.",

Resistance training (RT) and increased protein intake are strategies that may contribute to health improvements in older adults. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the effects of whey protein (WP) supplementation consumed either immediately pre- or post-RT on skeletal muscle mass (SMM), muscular strength, and functional capacity in pre-conditioned older women. Seventy older women participated in this investigation and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: whey protein pre-RT and placebo post-RT (WP-PLA, n = 24), placebo pre-RT and whey protein post-RT (PLA-WP, n = 23), and placebo pre- and post-RT (PLA-PLA, n = 23). Each group ingested 35 g of WP or PLA. The RT program was carried out over 12 weeks (three times per week; 3 \u00d7 8\u201312 repetition maximum). Body composition, muscular strength, functional capacity, and dietary intake were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for repeated measures, with baseline scores as covariates were used for data analysis. A time vs. group interaction (p < 0.05) was observed with WP-PLA and PLA-WP presenting greater increases compared with PLA-PLA for SMM (WP-PLA = 3.4%; PLA-WP = 4.2%; PLA-PLA = 2.0%), strength (WP-PLA = 8.1%; PLA-WP = 8.3%; PLA-PLA = 7.0%), and the 10-m walk test (WP-PLA = \u221210.8%; PLA-WP = \u221211.8%; PLA-PLA = \u22124.3%). Whey protein supplementation was effective in promoting increases in SMM, muscular strength, and functional capacity in pre-conditioned older women, regardless of supplementation timing.

One study looked at how weight training and taking whey protein could help improve health in older women. \n\nSeventy women took part in the study and were placed in one of three groups. The first group took whey protein before weight training and a placebo after, the second group took a placebo before weight training and whey protein after, and the final group took a placebo before and after weight training. All groups carried out weight training three times a week for 12 weeks.\n\nThe study found that the groups that took whey protein (either before or after training) saw better improvements in muscle mass, strength, and walk time compared to the groups who only took a placebo. This suggests that consuming whey protein, no matter when it's taken, can help improve muscle mass, strength and overall health in older women.

risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) than people with low blood LDL-cholesterol. Due to the increasingly high costs of medication in Thailand, the government has set up several measures to combat the problem. One of such strategies is to promote the utilization of locally manufactured drug products, especially those contained in the National Drug List. Simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is listed as an essential drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Here, we reported the study on the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of a generic simvastatin product in comparison with the Zocor\u00a9, in 43 healthy thai  volunteers.\n\nMETHOD.\nThe generic product tested  was Eucor\u00a9, locally manufactured by Greater Pharma Ltd., Part, Thailand, and the reference product was Zocor\u00a9 (Merck Sharp & Dohme, USA). The two products were administered as 10-mg single oral doses in a two-period crossover design. After drug administration, serial blood samples were collected every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. The major parameter monitored in this study was blood LDL-cholesterol.\n\nRESULT.\nAfter taking the drugs for the first 8 weeks, no statistically significant difference was dedected in blood LDL-cholesterol between the first (Zocor\u00a9-treated) and the second (Eucor\u00a9-treated) groups. After crossover and taking drugs for further 8 weeks, a similar result was obtained, i.e., no significant difference in blood LDL-cholesterol between the first (Eucor\u00a9-treated) and the second (Zocor\u00a9-treated) groups was observed. Upon completion of the 16-week study, there was also no statisticaly significant difference in the changes of all tested blood parameters between the two products (randomized block ANOVA, N = 37). Only minor side effects, mainly dizziness and nausea, were observed in both products.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur study demonstrated no significant differences in the therapeutic effect and safety between the generic and original simvastatin products.", "simplification": "BACKGROUND\nPeople with high levels of \"bad\" cholesterol, known as LDL-cholesterol, have a greater chance of getting heart disease. In Thailand, the cost of medicines is getting very high, so the government is encouraging people to take medications that are made locally, which are cheaper. One such drug is Simvastatin, which is used to lower high cholesterol levels. In this study, we compared how effective and safe a local version of Simvastatin is compared to an international one, in 43 healthy Thai people.\n\nMETHOD\nThe local Simvastatin we used was Eucor\u00a9, made by Thai company Greater Pharma Ltd. The international version was Zocor\u00a9, made by Merck Sharp & Dohme in the USA. Both versions of the drug were given to the participants once in the form of a 10-mg pill. We then took blood samples from them every 4 weeks for 16 weeks to see how much \"bad\" cholesterol was in their blood.\n\nRESULT\nThere was no significant difference in the amount of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood of the people who took the local drug versus the international drug. Similarly, after switching the drugs between the groups halfway through the study, we again found no significant difference. At the end of the 16-week study, we found no remarkable differences between the two drugs in all tested blood parameters. There were minor side effects from both drugs - mainly dizziness and nausea.\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study found that the local Simvastatin (Eucor\u00a9) is just as safe and effective at lowering \"bad\" cholesterol as the international Simvastatin (Zocor\u00a9).", "original_sentences": [{"sentence": "BACKGROUND.", "start": 0, "end": 11, "facts": []}, {"sentence": "It is commonly agreed that people
