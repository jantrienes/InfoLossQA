The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What phase was the trial in?\n2. What was the ratio of patients randomized to receive a Hickman or a TIVAS?\n3.

What was the percentage of devices removed prematurely in the Hickman and TIVAS arms?\n6. What specific procedure did the patients in the study require in addition to the heart bypass surgery?\n7. What was the cause of death for the five patients who died after surgery?\n8. What were the specific dosages of the drugs used, and when were they administered in relation to the surgery?\n9. What was considered a significant drop in blood pressure, and what solution was used to correct it?\n10. What specific type of exergaming intervention was examined in the study?\n11. What were the stages of Parkinson's disease of the participants in the study?\n12. How was postural stability assessed in the study?\n13. What was the design of the study?\n14. Which tests were used to assess balance in the study?\n15. In what aspect did the group that did the Kinect exergame improve more than the group that did traditional training?\n16. What were the specific treatments given to each group in the study?\n17. How were the pain levels measured and how significant were the results?\n18. What were the specific secondary objectives of the study?\n19. Where and how was the study conducted?\n20. How were the adherence rates compared among the three groups?\n21. What was the average number of follow-up visits for each group during the study period?\n22. What were the specific adherence rates for each group?\n23. What type of study was conducted to test the effects of Maraviroc?\n24. What was the condition of the HIV in the patients included in the study?\n25. What health markers were measured in the study?\n26. How much did Maraviroc improve blood flow in the study?\n27. What specific relationships were found between improvements in blood flow and inflammation, as well as immune activation?\n28. What specific alleles of the MTHFR gene were considered risk and non-risk in the study?\n29. What statistical method was used to analyze the changes in folate intake?\n30. What were the specific baseline folate intake values for the risk, non-risk, and control groups?\n31. What specific genotype did the study find did not improve folate intake in participants with the risk variant compared with those with the non-risk variant?\n32.
