The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.
