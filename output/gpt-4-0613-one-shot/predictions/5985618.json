This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n## Omissions\n- Original: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases. UC stands for ulcerative colitis and is an inflammatory bowel disease. The mayo score indicates how active or severe the disease is.\n\n## Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Original: \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\"\n- Simplification: \"The study\"\n- Rationale: The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a \"study\".\n- Question: How did the study control for bias?\n- Answer: The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\n\n- Original: \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\"\n- Simplification: \"low vitamin D levels\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\n- Question: How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\n- Answer: Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\n\n- Original: \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\"\n- Simplification: \"a survey about participant's quality of life\"\n- Rationale: the specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\n- Question: What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\n- Answer: The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Original\nINTRODUCTION.\nHalitosis and foreign body sensation are two common and disturbing symptoms of chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency (TC-RF) tonsil ablation with CO2-laser cryptolysis (CO2-LC) in the treatment of patients with halitosis caused by CCT.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nSixty-two patients who suffered from halitosis and/or foreign body sensation due to CCT were enrolled in the present randomized clinical trial, and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A underwent TC-RF tonsil ablation and Group B received CO2-LC. The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. Patient pain levels and amount of bleeding were evaluated as safety outcome measures. Pain levels were evaluated during the intervention, and at Day 1, 3, and 7 following the procedure using a visual analog scale (VAS).\n\nRESULTS.\nMean rank of pain score in the RF tonsil ablation group was found to be higher than in the CO2-LC group at all measured timepoints following the procedure. The amount of bleeding in the LC group was found to be significantly less than in the RF group (P<0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding duration of procedure (P=0.157).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth procedures were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of CT-associated halitosis. However, LC showed better results based on lower pain levels, lower incidence of bleeding, and faster progression to a routine diet.\n\n## Simplification\nINTRODUCTION.\nBad breath and a sensation of a foreign body are common symptoms of a chronic issue called tonsillitis where there's a cheesy substance in the throat. This study aimed to compare two treatments: one using controlled temperature radio waves and the other using a type of laser, to treat bad breath caused by this condition.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe had 62 people in the study who had bad breath and/or these feelings from their throat issue. They were split into two groups. One group received the treatment with radio waves and the other with the laser. We monitored how severe the symptoms were after a week, a month, and then six months after treatment. We also noted any pain suffered and any bleeding as measures of how safe it was. The pain was measured when the treatment was happening and on days 1, 3, and 7 after the treatment using a rating scale.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that the group treated with radio waves suffered more pain than the laser group at all times we checked after the procedure. The laser group had less bleeding than the radio wave group, a significant difference. However, the time for both procedures to complete wasn't significantly different.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth treatments were found to be effective and safe for treating chronic tonsillitis-associated bad breath. However, the laser showed better results as it caused less pain, less bleeding, and allowed patients to return to their normal diet sooner."}]}
