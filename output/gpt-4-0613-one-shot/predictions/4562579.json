Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n## Omissions\n- Original: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases. UC stands for ulcerative colitis and is an inflammatory bowel disease. The mayo score indicates how active or severe the disease is.\n\n## Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Original: \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\"\n- Simplification: \"The study\"\n- Rationale: The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a \"study\".\n- Question: How did the study control for bias?\n- Answer: The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\n\n- Original: \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\"\n- Simplification: \"low vitamin D levels\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\n- Question: How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\n- Answer: Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\n\n- Original: \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\"\n- Simplification: \"a survey about participant's quality of life\"\n- Rationale: the specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\n- Question: What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\n- Answer: The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Original\nStep-reduction (SR) in older adults results in muscle atrophy and an attenuated rise in postprandial muscle protein synthesis (MPS): anabolic resistance. Knowing that resistance exercise (RT) can enhance MPS, we examined whether RT could enhance MPS following 2 weeks of SR. In addition, as we postulated that SR may impair feeding-induced vasodilation limiting nutrient delivery to muscle, we also examined whether citrulline (CIT), as an arginine and nitric oxide precursor, could attenuate muscle anabolic resistance accompanying SR. We used a unilateral leg model to compare older subjects' who had undergone SR to a loaded condition of SR plus RT (SR + RT). Thirty older men (70 \u00b1 1 years) underwent 14 days of SR (<1500 steps/day) with supplementation of either 5 g/day CIT or glycine placebo. Throughout SR, subjects performed unilateral low-load RT thrice weekly. We assessed muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive and postprandial state (20 g whey isolate plus 15 g glycine or as micellar-whey with 5 g CIT or 15 g glycine, n = 10/group). As MPS was similar after ingestion of either whey isolate, micellar-whey, or micellar-whey + CIT data related to different dietary groups were collapsed to compare SR and SR + RT legs. Subjects' daily steps were reduced by 80 \u00b1 2% during SR (P < 0.001) compared with baseline. Leg fat-free mass decreased with SR (\u2212124 \u00b1 61 g) and increased in the SR + RT (+126 \u00b1 68 g; P = 0.003). Myofibrillar FSR was lower (P < 0.0001) in the SR as compared with the SR + RT leg in the postabsorptive (0.026 \u00b1 0.001%/h vs. 0.045 \u00b1 0.001%/h) and postprandial states (0.055 \u00b1 0.002%/h vs. 0.115 \u00b1 0.003%/h). We conclude that low-load RT, but not supplementation with CIT, can attenuate the deleterious effects of SR in aging muscle.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study explores how taking fewer steps (called Step-Reduction or SR) can make older adults' muscles weaker, and slow down the process of their bodies making proteins after eating - a process known as \"anabolic resistance\". The researchers wanted to know if doing resistance exercises (like lifting weights) could help boost this protein creation process, especially after a period of reduced activity. They also wondered if consuming citrulline (a substance that helps widen blood vessels) could counteract the negative impact of less movement by improving nutrient delivery to the muscles.\n\n30 older men (around 70 years old) were asked to reduce their daily steps to less than 1500 for two weeks. They were given either citrulline or a placebo (a substance with no effect), and did light resistance exercise with one of their legs. After the two weeks, the researchers checked the protein creation in their muscles both before and after meals, using different protein supplements.\n\nThe results showed that doing resistance exercise helped curb the negative effects of taking fewer steps, such as muscle loss, and improved the protein creation process after meals. However, taking citrulline didn't have any significant effect. The study suggests that resistance exercise can help older adults maintain healthy muscles, even if they are less active."}]}
