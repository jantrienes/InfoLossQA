This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n## Omissions\n- Original: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases. UC stands for ulcerative colitis and is an inflammatory bowel disease. The mayo score indicates how active or severe the disease is.\n\n## Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Original: \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\"\n- Simplification: \"The study\"\n- Rationale: The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a \"study\".\n- Question: How did the study control for bias?\n- Answer: The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\n\n- Original: \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\"\n- Simplification: \"low vitamin D levels\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\n- Question: How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\n- Answer: Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\n\n- Original: \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\"\n- Simplification: \"a survey about participant's quality of life\"\n- Rationale: the specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\n- Question: What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\n- Answer: The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Original\nABSTRACT.\nABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS::\nRecent studies have shown that etomidate is associated with fewer serious adverse events than propofol and has a noninferior sedative effect. We investigated whether etomidate\u2013midazolam is associated with fewer cardiopulmonary adverse events and has noninferior efficacy compared to propofol\u2013midazolam for screening colonoscopy in the elderly.\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was performed. Patients aged over 65 years who were scheduled to undergo screening colonoscopy were randomized to receive either etomidate or propofol based on midazolam. The primary outcome was all cardiopulmonary adverse events. The secondary outcomes were vital sign fluctuation (VSF), adverse events disturbing the procedure, and sedation-related outcomes.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) (P\u200a=\u200a.040). VSF was detected in 17 (27.4%) and 31 (50.0%) patients in the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively (P\u200a=\u200a.010). The incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol group (8.1%) (P\u200a=\u200a.008). Moreover, the incidence rate of myoclonus was significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol group (1.6%) (P\u200a=\u200a.004). There was no statistical significance between the 2 groups with respect to sedation times and sedation-related outcomes including patients\u2019 and endoscopist's satisfaction. In the multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179\u20130.926, P\u200a=\u200a.032).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nWe recommend using etomidate\u2013midazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol\u2013midazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score.\n\n## Simplification\nABSTRACT.\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS::\nRecent research shows that using etomidate for sedation during a colonoscopy could be safer than propofol for older people. Both are comparable in their effectiveness. We studied whether using etomidate with another sedative, midazolam, might lead to fewer heart and lung-related side effects compared to using propofol and midazolam. \n\nMETHODS.\nWe carried out a clinical trial at a single center. We focused on patients over 65 years old who were due for a routine colonoscopy. These patients were randomly chosen to receive either etomidate or propofol along with midazolam. We mainly wanted to see which group had less heart and lung issues. We also looked at the patient's vital signs, any issues that interfered with the procedure, and the results related to the use of sedatives.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe number of heart and lung-related issues was higher in the patients who received propofol (72.6%) as compared to those who received etomidate (54.8%). Changes in vital signs were observed in 27.4% of patients receiving etomidate and 50.0% of patients receiving propofol. Procedure-related complications were also significantly higher among patients in the etomidate group (25.8%) compared to the propofol group (8.1%). There were also more cases of muscle twitching observed in the etomidate group (16.1%) compared to the propofol group (1.6%). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of sedation times and how satisfied the patients and doctors were with the sedation process. When it came to changes in vital signs, patients receiving etomidate were much less likely to experience these than those receiving propofol.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFor patients who are at a high risk of complications or have severe medical conditions, we recommend using etomidate with midazolam. On the other hand, for patients at lower risk, propofol with midazolam could be a better choice."}]}
