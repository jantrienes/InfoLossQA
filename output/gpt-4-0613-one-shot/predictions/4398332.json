This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original: \"<span in original text>\"\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nFor fuzzy/imprecise concepts, please also indicate the corresponding span in the simplified text.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n## Original\nThis study evaluates the effects of vitamin D3 on disease activity and quality of life in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with hypovitaminosis D. The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n## Omissions\n- Original: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases. UC stands for ulcerative colitis and is an inflammatory bowel disease. The mayo score indicates how active or severe the disease is.\n\n## Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Original: \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\"\n- Simplification: \"The study\"\n- Rationale: The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a \"study\".\n- Question: How did the study control for bias?\n- Answer: The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\n\n- Original: \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\"\n- Simplification: \"low vitamin D levels\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\n- Question: How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\n- Answer: Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\n\n- Original: \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\"\n- Simplification: \"a survey about participant's quality of life\"\n- Rationale: the specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\n- Question: What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\n- Answer: The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Original\nAcute administration of the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis, \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs human facial affect recognition, implicating the endocannabinoid system in emotional processing. Another main constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has seemingly opposite functional effects on the brain. This study aimed to determine the effects of THC and CBD, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, THC (8 mg), CBD (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A visual analogue scale (VAS) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. In comparison to placebo, CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% emotional intensity; THC was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces of 40% intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both THC alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 'stoned'. CBD did not influence feelings of 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, CBD improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by THC. This is the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve and impair recognition of emotional faces.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at how THC and CBD, two main components of cannabis, affect how we perceive human emotions. THC tends to lead to misinterpreting faces with unclear emotions, while CBD actually improves this ability, particularly with emotions that are not very strong. When the two are combined, there is no negative effect on understanding emotions. Both THC taken alone, and THC combined with CBD, make people feel 'high', but CBD doesn't have this effect. Our previous cannabis use or personalities don't affect these outcomes. This is the first study that discusses how different components of cannabis can either help or harm our ability to recognize emotions in others."}]}
