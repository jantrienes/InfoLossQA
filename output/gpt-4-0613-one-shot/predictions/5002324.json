This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n## Omissions\n- Original: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases. UC stands for ulcerative colitis and is an inflammatory bowel disease.

Twenty people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I through III) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a balance-based exergaming group (N = 10) or a balance training group (N = 10) for an 8-week balance training period. Postural stability was assessed using the limits of stability (LOS) and one-leg stance (OLS) tests. Balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the timed up and go (TUG) test. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter training, participants in the balance-based exergaming group showed significant improvements in LOS performance, and in the eyes-closed condition of the OLS test. Both training programs led to improvements in BBS and TUG performance. Furthermore, balance-based exergaming training resulted in significantly better performance in directional control in the LOS test (78.9 \u00b1 7.65 %) compared with conventional balance training (70.6 \u00b1 9.37 %).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBalance-based exergaming training resulted in a greater improvement in postural stability compared with conventional balance training. Our results support the therapeutic use of exergaming aided by the Kinect sensor in people with PD.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov.NCT02671396\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12984-016-0185-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND.\nWe did a study to see if a special type of exercise game, called exergaming, that uses the Kinect sensor could help improve balance and stability in people with Parkinson's disease.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe performed a study where the participants didn't know what group they were in, and it was all decided randomly. We had twenty people with Parkinson's disease take part. These people were either at the early, middle or later stages of the disease. Half of them were put into a group that did the Kinect exergame for balance, and the other half were put into a group that did traditional balance training. This went on for 8 weeks. We used certain tests (LOS, OLS, BBS and TUG) to measure their balance and stability before and after the training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the training, we found that the group that did the Kinect exergame had better results in some stability tests. Both groups improved in the BBS and TUG balance tests. In one of the LOS tests, the exergaming group did much better than the traditional training group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe group that did the Kinect exergame improved more in their stability than the group that did traditional training. Our study suggests that these kind of exercise games can be helpful for people with Parkinson's disease.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe details of the trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov.NCT02671396\n\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL.\nThere's more information online in the supplement of the article.
