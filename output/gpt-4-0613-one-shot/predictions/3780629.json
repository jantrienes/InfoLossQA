This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification.

The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n## Omissions\n- Original: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases. UC stands for ulcerative colitis and is an inflammatory bowel disease. The mayo score indicates how active or severe the disease is.\n\n## Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Original: \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\"\n- Simplification: \"The study\"\n- Rationale: The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a \"study\".\n- Question: How did the study control for bias?\n- Answer: The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\n\n- Original: \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\"\n- Simplification: \"low vitamin D levels\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\n- Question: How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\n- Answer: Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\n\n- Original: \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\"\n- Simplification: \"a survey about participant's quality of life\"\n- Rationale: the specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\n- Question: What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\n- Answer: The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Original\nObjective: Computerized cognitive-bias modification (CBM) protocols are rapidly evolving in experimental medicine yet might best be combined with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). No research to date has evaluated the combined approach in depression. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate both the independent effects of a CBM protocol targeting imagery and interpretation bias (CBM-I) and the combined effects of CBM-I followed by iCBT. Method: Patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode were randomized to an 11-week intervention (1 week/CBM-I + 10 weeks/iCBT; n = 38) that was delivered via the Internet with no face-to-face patient contact or to a wait-list control (WLC; n = 31). Results: Intent-to-treat marginal models using restricted maximum likelihood estimation demonstrated significant reductions in primary measures of depressive symptoms and distress corresponding to medium-large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.62\u20132.40) following CBM-I and the combined (CBM-I + iCBT) intervention. Analyses demonstrated that the change in interpretation bias at least partially mediated the reduction in depression symptoms following CBM-I. Treatment superiority over the WLC was also evident on all outcome measures at both time points (Hedges gs = .59\u2013.98). Significant reductions were also observed following the combined intervention on secondary measures associated with depression: disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thinking (Cohen's d = 1.51\u20132.23). Twenty-seven percent of patients evidenced clinically significant change following CBM-I, and this proportion increased to 65% following the combined intervention. Conclusions: The current study provides encouraging results of the integration of Internet-based technologies into an efficacious and acceptable form of treatment delivery.\n\n## Simplification\nGoal: The study aims to test a program that combines computerized exercises and online therapy to improve depression symptoms. Until now, no one has tested how well this combination works for treating depression. \n\nMethod: Individuals with severe depression were randomly selected to participate in this 11-week program, which includes a week of computerized exercises and ten weeks of online therapy, done entirely online with no face-to-face meetings. They were compared to another group who were on a wait-list and did not receive any treatment.\n\nResults: The results showed that both the computerized exercises and the combination of these exercises and online therapy significantly reduced depression symptoms and levels of distress. This improvement was moderately to very strong, according to standard measurement tools. The reduction in depression symptoms was at least partly due to the ability of individuals to alter their negative thought patterns, as trained by the computerized exercises. The treatment group performed better than the wait-list group on every outcome measure at both time points. Measures such as disability, anxiety, and repetitive negative thoughts also significantly improved following the combined intervention. At the end of the computerized exercises, 27% of patients showed clinically significant improvements, and this percentage increased to 65% after completing the online therapy as well.\n\nConclusion: This study provides promising results that offering therapy through internet-based technologies can be an effective and acceptable method for treating depression."}]}
