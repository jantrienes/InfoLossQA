This annotation task is to identify pieces of information that were lost in the simplification process. You will be given two texts: the original and a simplification. Assume that a lay reader only sees the simplification. Identify all things which the reader can NOT learn from the simplification but that they could have learnt from the original.\n\nPlease classify each unit of information into one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Omissions: Pieces of information which were not included in the simplification.\n2. Imprecise/fuzzy concepts: Pieces of information which are included in the simplification, but that have been simplified to the extent that they became imprecise or completely lost their original meaning.\n\nAfterwards, please write a question-answer pair that would elicit the missing information from the original text. Phrase the question in such a way that a reader can understand it without having seen the original text. It should only contain concepts (entities, events, or states) that were mentioned in the simple text, or concepts that have not been directly mentioned but are generally known or inferable from mentioned ones. The answer should be understandable by an average adult, so please explain technical jargon if necessary. Make each question-answer pair as specific as possible and make sure that they are independent of each other. Ask only about one information unit at a time.\n\nA useful heuristic to decide between omissions and imprecise/fuzzy concepts is to see if the question-answer pair clarifies/expands some topic which is discussed in the simplification. If so, classify it as imprecise/fuzzy concepts, otherwise omission.\n\nAdhere to this output format:\n- Original: \"<span in original text>\"\n- Rationale: <a short rationale that describes what makes this an information loss>\n- Question: <the question that elicits missing information>\n- Answer: <the answer that provides the missing information from the original span>\n\nFor fuzzy/imprecise concepts, please also indicate the corresponding span in the simplified text.\n\nHere is an example.\n\n## Original\nThis study evaluates the effects of vitamin D3 on disease activity and quality of life in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with hypovitaminosis D. The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012\u20132013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 lU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups.\n\n## Simplification\nThis study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D. The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used a survey about participant's quality of life and conducted lab tests between the two groups.\n\n## Omissions\n- Original: \"Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not mention that the Partial Mayo Score was used.\n- Question: Besides quality of life survey and the serum tests, what other measures did the researchers use?\n- Answer: The researchers also tracked the partial mayo for UC diseases. UC stands for ulcerative colitis and is an inflammatory bowel disease. The mayo score indicates how active or severe the disease is.\n\n## Imprecise/fuzzy concepts\n- Original: \"The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial\"\n- Simplification: \"The study\"\n- Rationale: The simplification does not explain the design of the study, it only mentions that it was a \"study\".\n- Question: How did the study control for bias?\n- Answer: The study was double-blinded, so that neither the researcher nor the participants knew which treatment each participant received, and it was randomized, meaning the participants were randomly assigned one of the treatments.\n\n- Original: \"a serum 25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml\"\n- Simplification: \"low vitamin D levels\"\n- Rationale: the simplification does not explain the inclusion criteria, namely how low the vitamin D levels of eligible patients were.\n- Question: How low were the vitamin D levels in patients that were included in the study?\n- Answer: Participants in the study all had less than 30ng/ml of vitamin D, which is below the minimum recommendation of vitamin D levels in the body.\n\n- Original: \"Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life\"\n- Simplification: \"a survey about participant's quality of life\"\n- Rationale: the specific type of survey (SIBDQ) is not mentioned in the simplification\n- Question: What survey was used to measure participants' quality of life?\n- Answer: The Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) was used which gives insights about the physical, social, and emotional status of patients with bowel diseases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Original\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS.\nThe study aimed at comparing the performance of the novel optical AirtraqTM laryngoscope with the McCoyTM and conventional Macintosh laryngoscopes for ease of endotracheal intubation in patients with neck immobilisation using manual inline axial cervical spine stabilisation (MIAS) technique.\n\nMETHODS.\nNinety consenting American Society of Anaesthesiologist's physical status I\u2013II patients, aged 18\u201360 years, scheduled for various surgeries requiring tracheal intubation were randomly assigned into three groups of thirty each to undergo intubation with Macintosh, AirtraqTM, or McCoyTM laryngoscope with neck immobilisation by MIAS technique. The ease of intubation based on Intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score, Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic view, optimisation manoeuvres and impact on haemodynamic parameters were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA and Bonferroni correction for post hoc tests.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll patients in three groups had a comparable demographic profile and were successfully intubated. The AirtraqTM laryngoscope significantly reduced the IDS (mean \u2212 0.43 \u00b1 0.81) as compared with both McCoyTM (mean \u2212 1.63 \u00b1 1.49, P = 0.001) and Macintosh laryngoscope (mean \u22122.23 \u00b1 1.92, P < 0.001) and improved the Cormack-Lehane glottic view (77% grade 1 view and no patients with grade 3 or 4 view). There were less haemodynamic variations during laryngoscopy with the AirtraqTM compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope, but there was not between the AirtraqTM and McCoyTM laryngoscope groups.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn patients undergoing endotracheal intubation with cervical immobilisation, AirtraqTM laryngoscope was superior to the McCoyTM and Macintosh laryngoscopes, with greater ease of intubation and lower impact on haemodynamic variables.\n\n## Simplification\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS.\nThis study is about comparing three different types of tools used for placing breathing tubes in patients who have limited neck movement. The devices being compared are the Airtraq, McCoy, and a standard tool called the Macintosh laryngoscope.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe selected 90 adults, all relatively healthy and undergoing surgeries that need breathing tubes, to be part of this study. These 90 people were divided into three equal groups and each group was intubated using one of the devices. We measured how easy it was to use the device, the view of the throat area it provided, any additional maneuvers used to make intubation successful, and how it affected the patients' heart rates and blood pressure levels. We then used statistical analysis to compare the results. \n\nRESULTS.\nAll the patients in the three groups were successfully intubated. The Airtraq device made the process easier than the other two. It also provided a clearer view of the throat area. During the use of the Airtraq, there were fewer changes in the patients' heart rates and blood pressure levels compared to the Macintosh device but there were similar changes as when using the McCoy device.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor patients who need breathing tubes and whose necks can't move a lot, the Airtraq device makes it easier to place the tubes and cause less change in heart rate and blood pressure than the traditional Macintosh device and also the McCoy device."}]}
