There's a need for better ways to treat diabetes patients who also have high blood pressure at their primary doctor's office. There are a number of ways these patients are managed, but we don't know what the best approach is to control blood pressure for these people. 

In this study, we asked 54 people with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure to join three different groups. Group A went to a class run by a nurse about diabetes and high blood pressure. Group B went to the same class and was given a device to track their blood pressure at home. Group C, the control group, got the usual care they'd get from their doctors. 

Of the 24 people finished the study, only 20% reached the goal blood pressure we set. We didn't see any meaningful difference in average blood pressure from any of the groups. So trying to improve high blood pressure management for these patients didn't result in better blood pressure levels than the usual care. 

Research into why patients might not want to go to group classes and what they prefer when managing their disease could help make these treatment programs more successful in the future.
