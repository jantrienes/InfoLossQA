BACKGROUND.
We're trying to find better ways to vaccinate babies and young children against the flu.

METHODS.
We tested a flu vaccine (that doesn't contain a preservative called thimerosal) at two different amounts (0.50ml and 0.25ml) in kids aged between 6 and 35 months. Our study was designed and conducted carefully, with the researcher not knowing who received what amount of the vaccine. We also considered what flu shots the children had had before.

RESULTS.
We tested the vaccine on 374 children. The effectiveness (how well it boosts the immune system) of the vaccine for all three virus strains in the vaccine met the standards set for adults, and it didn't matter how much of the vaccine the kids got or how old they were. We found a small improvement in the immune response with the larger dose, but the difference wasn't significant. The two different doses had similar safety levels.

CONCLUSIONS.
Giving kids aged 6-35 months the larger dose (0.5ml) of this flu vaccine made a small improvement, but it wasn't a significant difference. Importantly, it was equally safe and well-tolerated as the smaller dose (0.25ml). We need more studies testing larger and smaller amounts of flu vaccine in young children.
