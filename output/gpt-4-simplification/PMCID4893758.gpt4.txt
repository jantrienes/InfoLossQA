INTRODUCTION
This study looked at how well two different types of pain relief work in making a common procedure of fixing a dislocated shoulder less painful. The two types of pain relief compared were remifentanil and a combination of fentanyl/midazolam.

METHOD
They conducted a blind trial (which means the patients didn't know which type of pain relief they were receiving) with patients aged between 18 and 64. They compared things like speed of the procedure, patient satisfaction and any problems that occurred between the two different pain relief methods.

RESULTS
Of the 96 people in the study, there was no significant difference in the characteristics of each group. The group that received remifentanil found the procedure to be quicker, more successful at managing pain, and more satisfactory compared to the fentanyl/midazolam group. There were slightly more problems in the midazolam/fentanyl group.

CONCLUSION
The results show that using remifentanil made the process of fixing a dislocated shoulder faster, more successful, less painful and more pleasing for patients when compared to the combination of fentanyl/midazolam.
