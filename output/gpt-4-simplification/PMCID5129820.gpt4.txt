BACKGROUND.
This study looks at a drug called olaparib that is currently used to slow down the growth of aggressive ovarian cancer. The drug seems most effective in patients with a specific gene mutation. Part of the study looked at whether the quality of life for patients using this drug was affected.

METHODS.
Patients either took olaparib capsules twice a day or a placebo until their cancer got worse. They reported on their quality of life and how their disease was affecting them using specific surveys. The main measurement they looked at was a score from one of these questionnaires.

RESULTS.
In total, 265 women were part of this study, with just over half taking olaparib and the rest taking a placebo. Most women in both groups reported 'no change' in their quality of life. There were no major differences found in the time it took for quality of life to get worse or improve in any of the test groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
Olaparib treatment was generally well-tolerated by patients and did not seem to have any negative effects on their quality of life. It's important to note that these results might not apply to patients who have not been responding to their most recent treatments.
