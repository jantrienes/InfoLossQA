GOAL.
This study aimed to see if personalized, computer-generated letters or simple advice from a physician could help people stop smoking. We also wanted to compare these two methods to see which one is more effective.

DESIGN.
We ran a controlled experiment where participants were placed into groups somewhat randomly.

SETTING.
We selected 34 doctor's offices in a particular part of Germany to take part in the study (87% agreed to participate).

PARTICIPANTS.
1499 smokers between the ages of 18 and 70 from these doctor's offices took part in the study (80% agreed to participate).

METHODS.
One group of participants received up to three personalized letters with advice on how to quit smoking. Another group received quick advice from their doctor during a regular visit. Both methods were based on a well-known theory about how people change their behaviours.

MEASUREMENTS.
We asked participants whether they had quit smoking at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after the start of the study.

RESULTS.
Among the participants who completed the study, 18.3% of those who received the letters and 14.8% of those who received advice from their doctor had quit smoking for at least 6 months. This is compared to 10.5% in the group that didn't receive any intervention. Even when including participants who didn't finish the study (assuming they hadn't quit smoking), we found both interventions to be more effective than doing nothing. The letters also proved to be more effective than the doctor's advice for those who managed to quit smoking for at least 24 hours.

CONCLUSIONS.
This study showed that both of these low-cost methods can help people quit smoking in the long term. They can easily be used across all doctor's offices and for all smoking patients. The computer-generated letters, in particular, are a promising way to regularly provide advice on quitting smoking without needing to overcome the usual obstacles.
