People with type 2 diabetes tend to have higher chances of bone fractures even though their bone density is normal or even higher than average. This indicates that the quality of their bone might be the real issue. Raloxifene is a drug recognized for increasing bone quality regardless of bone density. This study was conducted to see whether Raloxifene can offset the negative impact of diabetes on bone strength in rats that are prone to diabetes.

24 adult rats which were likely to develop diabetes were chosen for this experiment. They were all females and were 20 weeks old. They were fed a high-fat diet that could lead to diabetes and divided randomly into two groups. One group received daily injections of Raloxifene for 12 weeks and the other group got a placebo. 

During this period, their blood sugar levels were checked every week. Hemoglobin levels which can give us an idea about long-term blood glucose levels were checked at the start and end of the experiments. The bones in their legs and back were tested after the rats were killed.

The group of rats that received Raloxifene saw fewer cases of diabetes compared to the placebo group. Additionally, their blood sugar levels were significantly lower than the other group. Importantly, the leg bones of the Raloxifene group were stronger, meaning they didnâ€™t break easily because they could absorb more energy before yielding. It was observed that this picture is similar when looking at the structural features of the bone like energy required to cause a break, the amount of energy beyond which breakage occurs and the distance for which it can stretch beyond this point.

These results suggest Raloxifene could be beneficial in preventing the start of diabetes and improving bone health in those susceptible to diabetes. If future experiments and patient tests confirm these results, it could be a new way to manage the quality of bone in diabetes patients and simultaneously prevent the onset of diabetes.
