This study looks at how THC and CBD, two main components of cannabis, affect how we perceive human emotions. THC tends to lead to misinterpreting faces with unclear emotions, while CBD actually improves this ability, particularly with emotions that are not very strong. When the two are combined, there is no negative effect on understanding emotions. Both THC taken alone, and THC combined with CBD, make people feel 'high', but CBD doesn't have this effect. Our previous cannabis use or personalities don't affect these outcomes. This is the first study that discusses how different components of cannabis can either help or harm our ability to recognize emotions in others.
