This study was about seeing how having a meal before exercising affected growth hormone levels in the blood and the burning of fat during walking exercise. The people in the study (8 of them) were given either a glucose drink or just water half an hour before they started walking on a treadmill at half of their maximum exercise output for an hour. 

The people who had the glucose drink had significantly more growth hormone in their blood, compared to those who only had water, after 15 and 30 minutes. However, the rate at which they were burning fat was significantly lower at certain time intervals (5-15 minutes, 25-35 minutes, and 45-55 minutes into their walk). Their level of free fatty acids in the blood was also lower after 30, 45, and 60 minutes of walking. The glucose drinkers had lower blood sugar levels but higher insulin levels after 15 and 30 minutes. 

In conclusion, this study suggests that having a meal before exercising might raise growth hormone levels in the blood, but it doesn't seem to be strongly tied to fat burning and free fatty acid levels in the blood during mild exercise like walking.
