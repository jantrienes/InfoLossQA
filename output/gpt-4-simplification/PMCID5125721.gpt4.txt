Tartary buckwheat (TB) is a food that may help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Since type 2 diabetes can often lead to kidney disease, it could be that eating TB on a daily basis can help improve the chances of not getting kidney disease.

In this study, 104 people with type 2 diabetes were divided into two groups. One group stuck to their normal diet but had lessons on nutrition and food. The other group replaced some of their daily food with TB. After four weeks of this, blood samples and food diaries were collected from all participants.

The results showed that eating TB everyday lowered some of the markers that indicates risk of kidney disease for those people in the TB food group. These markers were the 'urinary albumin to creatinine ratio' and 'urea nitrogen'. However, it did not seem to impact blood sugar levels over this four weeks. Further checks on sub groups based on their stage of kidney disease also showed a similar result. 

So, the study supports the idea that replacing some daily food with TB can likely reduce kidney problems in people with type 2 diabetes. It seems like a simple and effective way for diabetes patients to improve their kidney health.
