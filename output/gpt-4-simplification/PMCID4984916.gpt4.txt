BACKGROUND.
In the UK, we don't often use totally implantable venous access systems (TIVAS). These are devices that allow doctors to access your veins for treatments or taking blood samples. They're more expensive and trickier to put in than the usually used Hickman catheters. We're not sure if the extra costs of TIVAS might be worth it because of possible health benefits. We ran a small trial to get more information and help design a bigger, more detailed trial later.

METHODS.
This trial involved two cancer centres in the UK and was organized to observe and compare the use of Hickman catheters and TIVAS. We looked at how many problems arose overall and for each treatment, how long it took for the first problem to happen, and how patientsâ€™ quality of life was affected. We also looked at the economic impact of each treatment.

RESULTS.
We had 100 patients divide into two groups for the trial. More than half of those with the Hickman catheter had one or more problems, while less than half with the TIVAS system did. In the Hickman group, about a third had to have their catheter removed early because of problems, while only a tiny portion in the TIVAS group did. Based on a questionnaire, patients with TIVAS were happier with their treatment in most areas. Cost-wise, using the Hickman catheter was more expensive per person. However, when we consider quality of life adjustment, the costs were about the same. But again, these results are not confirmed.

CONCLUSIONS.
TIVAS devices might be the more cost-effective option compared to Hickman catheters. We need to do a larger trial in more centres to be more sure of these findings.
