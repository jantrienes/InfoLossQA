BACKGROUND.
This study aimed to find if using either of two kinds of fluids during surgery could help reduce the feelings of nausea and vomiting that patients often have after surgery. The fluids we used were known as colloid and crystalloid, and we administered them via an IV drip during a specific type of gynecologic surgery called laparoscopy.

METHODS.
We randomly divided 120 patients to either receive the colloid or crystalloid fluid during their surgery. The amount of fluid we gave was based on the patient's weight and how many hours they had gone without food. After surgery, we checked up on the patients four times (30 minutes, 2 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery) to ask them about their symptoms. In a smaller set of patients, we also tested how well their lungs were working.

RESULTS.
We found that two hours after surgery, more patients that had received the colloid fluid felt nauseous (38.2% vs 17.9%) and their nausea was also worse than those who had received the crystalloid fluid. Vomiting and use of anti-nausea medication were low in both groups. We didn't see any differences when comparing symptoms like sore throat, dizziness, headache or general well-being. Both kinds of fluid caused similar reductions in lung function.

CONCLUSIONS.
Overall, we found that the use of colloid fluid during surgery increased post-surgery nausea and didn't have any advantages over crystalloid fluid in controlling post-surgery symptoms in gynecological laparoscopic surgery.
