BACKGROUND.
Older adults with several health problems often get prescribed too many medications. One group of drugs, known as anticholinergics, can be especially dangerous if overused, as they can have harmful effects on health and brain function. We wanted to see whether a special type of coordinated care between doctors and pharmacists could help reduce the use of these drugs. 

METHODS.
We had older patients at the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center, who were taking at least one anticholinergic drug, participate in an 8-week study. We split them into two groups. One group received extra help and advice from a team of a pharmacist and a doctor, while the other group received usual care. We then compared how the groups changed in their use of anticholinergic drugs over the course of the study.

RESULTS.
We recruited 50 patients between October 2014 and September 2015. Most were women, white, and with normal brain function. On average, they were around 78 years old. At the start of the study, half of them were taking two or more anticholinergic drugs. After the study,  the group that received extra care saw improved medication appropriateness and reduced their use of anticholinergic drugs. 

CONCLUSIONS.
Our results suggest that the additional support from a doctor and pharmacist team can help older adults reduce their use of potentially harmful medications. This finding is an important step toward helping older adults take only the medications that benefit them the most.
