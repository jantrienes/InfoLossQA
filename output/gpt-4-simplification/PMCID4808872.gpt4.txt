This study looked at the how taking creatine, a supplement often used by athletes, affects a person's strength and power. Thirty athletes took part in the study and did weight lifting exercises and jumps for testing muscle strength and power. They also completed what is known as a post-activation potentiation (PAP) test, which is a way to measure how taking creatine can make their muscles more powerful right after working out.

The athletes were split into two groups. One group took 20 grams of creatine each day for six days, and the other group took a placebo, or a substance that has no real effect. After taking the supplement, the group who took creatine were able to lift more weight and their muscles got powerful more quickly after working out compared to the group who took the placebo. However, there was no noticeable difference in the jump test between the two groups.

This study shows that creatine can help increase muscle strength and make muscles powerful more quickly after working out, but it doesn't seem to have an effect on how high a person can jump.
