BACKGROUND/AIMS.
This study looks into polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition often paired with insulin resistance, high adrenal activity and decreased mental wellbeing. It tests the effects of a drug called escitalopram (or a placebo) on these issues in women with PCOS.

METHODS.
The trial involved 42 overweight women with PCOS who were not experiencing clinical depression. They were split into two groups â€“ one group took 20mg of escitalopram daily for 12 weeks, the other took a placebo. The women underwent physical exams, blood tests, and completed questionnaires about their mental health and quality of life. 

RESULTS.
The average participant was 31 years old, had a BMI of 35.8 and a waist measurement of 102cm. Escitalopram was found to be related to an increase in waist size and cortisol (stress hormone) levels, compared to the placebo group. However, the drug didn't significantly affect insulin levels, lipid levels, mental health or the overall quality of life.

CONCLUSION.
In women with PCOS but without clinical depression, escitalopram increased waist circumference and cortisol levels. However, it didn't noticeable alter metabolic risk factors, mental wellbeing or quality of life.
