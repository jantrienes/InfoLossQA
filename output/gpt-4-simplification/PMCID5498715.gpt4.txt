BACKGROUND.
Regular exercise helps to prevent many long-term illnesses. This research uses a theory known as Self-determination theory (SDT) which helps to understand people's motivations for exercise and how to increase their motivation.

OBJECTIVE.
The goal of the research was to use a method called motivational interviewing (MI), guided by SDT, to see if it could help encourage more exercise among women of child-bearing age.

METHODS.
The study included 70 women fitting these criteria. They were picked using a random method and divided into two groups. All participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about their current levels of physical fitness and motivation for exercise. These questionnaires were tested and approved for reliability. One group (35 women) participated in four motivational interviewing sessions based on the SDT theory and one general education session about exercise. The other group (35 women) just participated in the general education session about exercise.

RESULTS.
Four months later, the women in the group that attended motivation interviewing sessions were doing significantly more physical activity overall. These women also showed improvements in specific fitness aspects: flexibility, muscular and cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) endurance. They also became less sedentary (inactive). Moreover, these women were more self-motivated to exercise, felt more competent, more in control, enjoyed exercising more, and had more health-driven reasons to exercise than women in the other group.

CONCLUSION.
The research shows that using motivational interviewing based on the Self-determination Theory can successfully encourage women of child-bearing age to exercise more.

TRIAL REGISTRATION.
The study was officially registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial.
