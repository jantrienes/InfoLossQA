GOAL.
This study aimed to test if a medicine (VM202) containing two proteins beneficial for liver growth, delivered through muscle injections, can be used safely and effectively to reduce pain in patients suffering from diabetes-related nerve pain.

METHODS.
In a scientifically controlled study, patients were randomly chosen to get injections of two different amounts of VM202 or a placebo. They received injections on the first day and again two weeks later. The main goal was to see if there was a change in the average pain score collected through a week-long pain diary. Secondary goals included how many patients responded to the treatment, improvements in quality of life and pain measurements, and the density of nerves in the skin.

RESULTS.
No major side effects related to VM202 were reported. Eighty-four patients finished the study. Patients who got the lower dosage of VM202 reported the most improvement in all areas measured, including a significant reduction in average pain after 3 months, and continued but statistically not significant reductions in pain at 6 and 9 months. Nearly half of these patients felt pain reduced by at least 50%, compared to 17.6% using the placebo. These patients also reported significant improvements in a standard pain survey for diabetic neuropathy and a standard questionnaire about neuropathy. Patients who were not already on specific pain medicines had the largest reductions in pain.

CONCLUSION.
VM202 showed that it was safe, tolerated well, and effective, indicating it could potentially be used as a new gene therapy approach to treat diabetes-related nerve pain. Just two days of treatment provided symptom relief and improved quality of life for three months. VM202 could be especially beneficial for patients not already taking specific pain drugs.
