Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been suggested as a method to promote healing in damaged cells. This includes the potential to help with hearing loss and tinnitus (a ringing or noise in the ears), although research so far has shown mixed results. Our study aimed to check if this treatment could improve hearing, understanding of speech, and general ear function in adults suffering from hearing loss.

To do this, we set up a study where subjects were sorted into three groups randomly. One group received the laser treatment, which involved shining low-level lasers onto their outer ear, head, and neck. Each laser treatment lasted about five minutes and was given three times in a week. Another group was given a placebo treatment, and the third group was not treated.

We ran a series of hearing tests on each participant right before the first treatment and right after the last one. Our tests checked how well they could hear, understand speech, and how well their ear was working overall (using what's called pure-tone audiometry, the Connected Speech Test, and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions). 

After comparing the before and after results of all the tests, we found that there were no significant differences in the hearing abilities among the three groups. Meaning, the laser treatment did not bring about any noticeable improvement. Similarly, no significant changes were noticed in the hearing abilities of any individual participant either.

This experiment has been officially registered with a database called ClinicalTrials.gov under the ID: NCT01820416.
