GOAL AND PURPOSE.
The goal of this study was to understand how effective a specific type of dental implant surgery, known as flapless implant surgery, is in improving the appearance of the soft tissues in the mouth. We also compared the performance of two types of implants - ones that are immediately put to use (IL) versus those that are left to adjust for a while (DL).

HOW WE DID THE STUDY.
We conducted this study with 20 patients who were missing some teeth in the front part of their upper mouth. We split them into two groups. In the first group (IL), we placed 10 implants that we immediately put to use and fitted with a permanent crown after 14 days. In the second group (DL), we placed 10 implants but only started using them after 4 months. We used different styles of implants for each group. To measure the outcome, we took note of various factors related to the soft tissues in the mouth at different times.

RESULTS.
The success of first group was 80%, which was slightly less than the 90% success rate of the second group. However, when we compared the two, we found that the difference wasn't statistically significant. We also found no significant difference in most measurements of the soft tissues between the two groups over time. However, one measurement did increase significantly more in the second group compared to the first.

CONCLUSION.
In conclusion, our study suggests that flapless implant surgery, whether we start using the implants right away or after a delay, can help improve the appearance of the mouth.
