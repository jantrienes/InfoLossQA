PURPOSE.
This study aimed to see if a sustained-release version of a medication called aceclofenac helped people with long-term knee arthritis pain, and if it was safe to use. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
125 people with knee arthritis were randomly split into two groups: one group (made up of 62 people) was given the long-lasting aceclofenac once a day, the other group (made up of 63 people) was given the regular aceclofenac twice a day, for a month. Tools used to track changes included a pain rating scale, a knee health score, and a measure of how far they could move their knee. To check if the medication was safe, any side effects, vital signs (like heart rate and blood pressure), general health checks, lab tests and heart wave tests were also captured and recorded. 

RESULTS.
Both groups showed improvements in their pain levels, knee health scores and range of motion after taking the medicine for a month. However, there was no significant difference in these improvements between the two groups. There were also no major differences in the side effects, vital signs, health checks, lab tests or heart wave tests between the two groups. 

CONCLUSIONS.
The findings show that both the day-long and regular aceclofenac are just as successful in improving symptoms in people with chronic knee arthritis, and they appear to be safely used with no major differences found in this study. The sustained aceclofenac can be taken once daily, making it a useful option for people using this medication.
