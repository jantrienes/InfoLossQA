BACKGROUND.
We did a study to see if a special type of exercise game, called exergaming, that uses the Kinect sensor could help improve balance and stability in people with Parkinson's disease.

METHODS.
We performed a study where the participants didn't know what group they were in, and it was all decided randomly. We had twenty people with Parkinson's disease take part. These people were either at the early, middle or later stages of the disease. Half of them were put into a group that did the Kinect exergame for balance, and the other half were put into a group that did traditional balance training. This went on for 8 weeks. We used certain tests (LOS, OLS, BBS and TUG) to measure their balance and stability before and after the training.

RESULTS.
After the training, we found that the group that did the Kinect exergame had better results in some stability tests. Both groups improved in the BBS and TUG balance tests. In one of the LOS tests, the exergaming group did much better than the traditional training group.

CONCLUSIONS.
The group that did the Kinect exergame improved more in their stability than the group that did traditional training. Our study suggests that these kind of exercise games can be helpful for people with Parkinson's disease.
