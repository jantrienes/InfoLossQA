GOAL OF THE STUDY:
This study aimed to check how a drug called certolizumab pegol (CZP) helps adults with a type of arthritis, known as psoriatic arthritis (PsA), in their work life, home life, as well as in their ability to participate in family gatherings, socials and their hobbies.

HOW THE STUDY WAS DONE:
A large-scale trial involving 409 adults with PsA was conducted using either CZP or a placebo. They were divided into three groups - one got a placebo, one got a middle dose of CZP every 2 weeks, and the third received a higher dose of CZP every 4 weeks. A survey was used to measure if the drug increased productivity at work and home, and participation in various activities over a month. This survey data was then statistically examined and compared between the groups.

WHAT THE STUDY FOUND:
When the study started, a little over half of the people in each of the three groups had jobs. By week 24, those taking CZP were able to work more, missing 1.0 to 1.8 days less in a month due to illness and experiencing 3.0 to 3.9 fewer days of reduced productivity while at work compared to those taking the placebo. At home, the individuals on CZP also were more productive, gaining an average of 3 to 3.5 days of productive household work in a month. They also participated more in social and family activities and hobbies. These benefits started to appear as early as the 4th week and continued till the 24th week of the treatment.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
The drug CZP can significantly help improve the work, home productivity, and social engagement of adults dealing with psoriatic arthritis.
