BACKGROUND.
In Australia, one out of four births are induced, or started artificially. Usually, this requires a woman to stay in a hospital overnight for a procedure involving a hormone called prostaglandin. However, new studies show that a balloon catheter, a tube with an inflatable section, can also be used for something called cervical ripening and is just as effective as prostaglandins. The bonus is that it doesn't cause stimulation of the womb. For low-risk pregnancies, this method allows women to have the procedure at home. We conducted an initial small-scale study to compare this at-home method with the usual in-hospital procedure in terms of results, how it's done, and how acceptable it is to both women and clinicians.

METHODS.
We had 48 women with low-risk pregnancies take part in the study. Two thirds of them tried the at-home method while one third stayed in the hospital. We looked at a few key things, like whether labor-inducing drugs were needed, if a C-section was performed, and any health problems. We also got feedback on how acceptable this procedure was both from women and healthcare professionals.

RESULTS.
Outcomes for mother and baby were similar in both groups. Most women, 77%, needed labor-inducing drugs. However, the group at home was 24% less likely to need these drugs. There were no treatment failures, infections, or over-stimulation of the womb in either group. Most women reported discomfort with the balloon catheter but were equally satisfied overall. They felt their baby was safe and experienced less loneliness. Healthcare professionals were more comfortable with sending a woman home with a balloon catheter than prostaglandins, and most agreed they would offer the at-home method to eligible women.

CONCLUSIONS.
The study suggests that, for inducing labor, the at-home method using a balloon catheter deserves further investigation. It should be studied in a larger, more accurate trial.

TRIAL REGISTRATION.
The trial was registered in advance at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.
