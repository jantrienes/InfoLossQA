INTRODUCTION.
This study looked at possible damage to teeth (called "dentinal cracks and craze lines") during root canal treatments using three different dental tools.

METHODS AND MATERIALS.
A hundred human premolars (kind of teeth) with single canals were used. They were grouped into four sets of 25 each. Teeth in the first three groups were treated with one of the three dental tools each. The last group's teeth were left untreated as a control. After these treatments, parts of the teeth were cut and examined under a microscope. The gathered data was then statistically analysed.

RESULTS.
The control group of untreated teeth showed no cracks. All the treatment methods caused some cracks. Two of the tools, Mtwo and ProTaper Universal, caused significantly more cracks than the third tool, Reciproc which didn't cause significantly more cracks than the untreated group. 

CONCLUSION.
All three treatment methods caused some dental damage. But the tool Reciproc caused the least, being nearly equivalent to no treatment at all.
