BACKGROUND.
This study looks at two ways of treating gum recession and compares how effectively they work. One method uses a surgical technique called the envelope-type of coronally advanced flap (CAF) by itself. The other method combines this surgical technique with a collagen membrane (NEOMEM). 

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study involved ten people aged between 20 and 50 who had gum recession on both sides of their mouth. Each person's gum recession was split into two groups. Group A was treated using just the surgical technique and Group B used the surgical technique and the collagen membrane. The team measured the depth and width of the gum recession, as well as other factors at the start of the study and after three and six months. 

RESULTS.
The team treated 46 cases of gum recession during the study. In Group B - where the surgical technique was combined with the collagen membrane - the average original depth of the gum recession was about 2.34mm. In Group A, where only the surgical technique was used, this was roughly 2.52mm. Both treatments effectively reduced the depth of the gum recession, but the reduction was significantly more in Group B. Both treatments also saw significant changes in the other factors that were measured. However, the changes were much more pronounced in Group B.

CONCLUSION.
The combination of the surgical technique and the collagen membrane was more effective at treating gum recession than the surgical technique alone. This combination also led to better results in the gain of gum attachment as well as the width of the keratinized tissue, which is the outer, protective layer of the gums.
