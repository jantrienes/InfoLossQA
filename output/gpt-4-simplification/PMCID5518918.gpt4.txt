GOAL: 
We wanted to see whether following a heart-related event, at-home fitness programs with virtual support could help more patients stick with their exercise routines and possibly get better results. 

METHODS AND RESULTS:
We tried this with 90 patients who had medium or low risk for future heart issues. We divided them into two groups: one group did their rehab exercises at home with virtual support, and the other group did the same exercises but at a rehab center. 

We found out that both groups stuck to their workouts equally well. However, the people who exercised at home were happier. Also, everyone in both groups got more fit after rehab and kept that up after one year, with no big difference between the two groups. 

Exercise levels didn't change within one year. Although not statistically significant, it seemed to cost less for the healthcare system if patients exercised at home, by an average of €437 per patient. When we looked at the bigger picture, we also found that the home-based training might save more money – around €3160 per patient. 

CONCLUSION:
Overall, we didn't find a big difference in fitness gains, physical activity levels, or life quality between at-home workouts with virtual help and center-based workouts. But with the folks at home, they liked their workouts more and it cost less overall. So, we believe that for patients with low-to-medium heart disease risk, using at-home workouts with virtual support works just as well as doing workouts at a rehab center.
