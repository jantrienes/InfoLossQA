BACKGROUND.
This study investigates alirocumab, a drug used to lower cholesterol levels in the body. The effect of alirocumab can be influenced by other substances in the body like PCSK9, which can increase when a person is on certain medications like statins. This study examines how alirocumab operates when interacting with other cholesterol-lowering drugs that are not statins. 

METHODS AND RESULTS.
The study reported the impact of alirocumab with cholesterol-lowering substances (ezetimibe, fenofibrate) in people with high cholesterol levels. Also, how the effects of alirocumab last was assessed. They gave alirocumab to people for 4 weeks combined with other substances. The results showed that alirocumab helped in reducing cholesterol levels in the body, the decreases lifted over time, particularly when alirocumab was used with fenofibrate and ezetimibe.

CONCLUSIONS.
Overall, alirocumab was effective in reducing cholesterol when used alone or with other cholesterol-reducing substances. Even though there were slight decreases in the drug's effectiveness over time when used with ezetimibe or fenofibrate, these interactions would still allow for alirocumab to be used every 4 weeks in patients undergoing treatment with these drugs.
