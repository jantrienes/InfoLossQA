GOAL AND PLAN
The goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.

STUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.
We asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogel® every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.

WHAT WE FOUND.
Ninety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the Autogel® than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the Autogel® and patients were happy with the treatment.

CONCLUSIONS.
Using lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks works just as well and is as well tolerated as using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every one to two weeks in treating acromegaly.
