BACKGROUND:
The World Health Organization emphasizes that support for caregivers, especially those taking care of people with dementia, should be both affordable and easy to access. This is due to the growing number of people who have dementia and the negative effects on the mental health of the family members who care for them.

METHODS:
We ran a study to see if an online program called 'Mastery over Dementia' could help. We had 251 caregivers participate, but 6 dropped out right at the beginning. The caregivers were randomly split into two groups. One group (149 people) used the online program and we compared them to the second group (96 people) who only received informational emails. We wanted to see if there was a change in signs of depression and anxiety. The caregivers answered all our questions through the internet and we made sure to include everyone's data in the final analysis.

RESULTS:
Most of the caregivers were husbands, wives, or children of the person with dementia. Most of them were women who lived in the same house as the person they were caring for. Their ages ranged from 26 to 87 and their education background varied greatly, with about half having at least a college degree. We discovered that the caregivers who used the online program had noticeably less signs of depression and anxiety after using the program.

CONCLUSIONS:
Our study shows that the 'Mastery over Dementia' online program can be a useful tool for family caregivers of people with dementia since it reduces signs of depression and anxiety. This suggests that developing more online resources like this could be beneficial for family caregivers, making support more accessible and financially manageable. This is promising for the future generations of caregivers who will likely be familiar with using the internet.
