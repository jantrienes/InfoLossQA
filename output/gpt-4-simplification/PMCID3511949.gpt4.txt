INTRODUCTION.
This research study aimed to find out whether giving people with knee osteoarthritis an injection of either morphine or triamcinolone directly into their knee was a good way to help them manage their pain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
We selected people between 50 and 80 years old who have knee osteoarthritis. We divided them into three groups. One group received a knee injection of morphine and bupivacaine, another group received a knee injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine, and the third group received a knee injection of just saltwater (saline) and bupivacaine. We checked on these patients before they received the injection, and then at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the injection. We gave them paracetamol tablets each day for extra pain relief if needed. If paracetamol didn't help enough, we recommended they take dexketoprofen trometamol tablets.

RESULTS.
We found that after getting the knee injection, both the morphine group and the triamcinolone group had their pain decrease significantly compared to the group that got just the saltwater injection. This pain decrease was seen in the first 2 weeks and remained steady an entire 3 months (12 weeks) after. Based on a pain and physical function test (WOMAC test), both the morphine and the triamcinolone group decreased more than the saltwater group. However, there was no major difference between the morphine group and the triamcinolone group. The morphine and triamcinolone groups used fewer extra pain relief tablets compared to the saltwater group.

CONCLUSION.
Treatments with knee injections of either morphine or triamcinolone can help patients with knee osteoarthritis manage their pain. However, morphine might be the better choice as it has fewer side effects compared to the triamcinolone.
