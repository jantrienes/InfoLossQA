PURPOSE:
This report talks about a 3-year study conducted on a treatment device named Superion®. The device was used for patients dealing with moderate lower back spinal degeneration, which was approved for testing by the US Food and Drug Administration. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
People aged 45 years and above, suffering from moderate lower back spinal degeneration, were tested using the Superion® device. This was done between 2008 and 2011 at 31 different testing sites. In total, 391 people participated in the study. These included 190 patients treated with Superion® and 201 others who were given an alternative, X-STOP®, for comparison. The success of the treatment was judged based on improvements in patients in various areas, no repeat operations, no severe complications from the implant or procedure, and no significant additional treatments needed.

RESULTS:
Three years after treatment, a larger percentage of the Superion® treated patients showed successful recovery (around 52.5%) compared to those with X-STOP® (around 38%). For each separate aspect of recovery, over 80% of the Superion® patients showed improvements. These patients also maintained less severity of back and leg pain, and better back-functioning and disease-related outcomes over the 36 months.

CONCLUSION:
The study results, after three years, consistently show the Superion® device to be effective in treating patients with moderate lower back spinal degeneration. The positive outcomes remained stable throughout the time-frame.
