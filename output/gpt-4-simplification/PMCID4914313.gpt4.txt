BACKGROUND.
This research focused on a type of pancreatic cancer that is hard to treat and often results in death. Specifically, it tested if a combined treatment of chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy with or without an extra drug called cetuximab would help. It also checked if a biomarker (something in your body that can be measured to show the presence of disease), called miR-21, could predict how patients would respond to the treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
In this trial, patients who couldn't undergo surgery for their pancreatic cancer were given a specific combination of drugs for 16 weeks. Only patients whose cancer didn't worsen or even improved after this initial treatment were then given another drug either with or without cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy. The key measure of success was overall survival rate. They also compared people's response to the treatment based on their levels of the biomarker miR-21.

RESULTS.
17 patients took the initial drugs, and 13 of them improved enough to receive the extra treatments. After about 5 years, they recorded how long it took for patients' cancers to get worse and how long the patients lived overall. They didn't see a big difference whether patients received the extra drug cetuximab or not. They did find that patients with high levels of the biomarker miR-21 generally did worse compared to those with lower levels, in terms of both how quickly their cancer got worse and how long they lived.

CONCLUSIONS.
Adding cetuximab to the chemo-radiotherapy after the initial combination drug treatment didn't seem to improve survival rates. Having a high level of the miR-21 biomarker at the start was linked to patients faring worse. This suggests it might be a useful predictor for this particular combination treatment for this type of hard-to-treat pancreatic cancer.
