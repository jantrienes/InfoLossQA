BACKGROUND.
This research aims to see if combining two types of medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids, can result in better relief from inflammation and pain after surgery, and with fewer side effects. The study focused on the effects of a steroid (dexamethasone) and an anti-inflammatory (diclofenac potassium) when used together, compared to just using diclofenac potassium alone. The effects were measured on patients undergoing the surgical removal of their third molars, more commonly known as wisdom teeth.

RESEARCH METHODS.
This was a study where patients didn't know which treatment they were getting to ensure an unbiased result. It was done at a hospital in Nigeria. One hundred patients who were having their wisdom teeth removed were randomly selected and divided into two groups. One group received both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium, while the other group only received diclofenac potassium. The researchers then measured the overall effectiveness of the medications for relief from pain. They also measured the swelling of the patients' faces and the ability of their mouths to open before and after the operation.

RESULTS.
Using both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together was found to provide significantly better relief from pain and facial swelling in the first 48 hours post-surgery compared to using diclofenac potassium alone. However, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the patient's mouth-opening ability.

CONCLUSION.
According to this study, using both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together improves short-term relief from post-surgery pain and swelling, compared to using diclofenac potassium alone in patients getting their wisdom teeth removed.
