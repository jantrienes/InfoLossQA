BACKGROUND.
Obesity is a major health issue around the world and can cause a range of other health problems. One of these problems is called metabolic syndrome, which is linked to fat in the stomach area. Various ways have been used to reduce this fat, like liposuction. A noninvasive method, meaning it doesn't involve surgery, is the use of a special cream. In this study, we looked at how effective Arnebia Euchroma (AE), a type of cream, is at reducing stomach fat. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study was conducted in a medical clinic in Iran in 2014. After explaining the study and getting their approval, we divided the participants into two groups. One group used the AE cream on their stomach area for 6 weeks, the other group used a placebo (a cream with no active ingredients). We measured their body mass index, waist and buttock size, and stomach fat at the beginning, and then again after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We used different statistical methods to compare the results.

RESULTS.
Sixty women took part in the study (thirty in each group). Ten dropped out, so fifty completed it. By the end, the participants had lost a significant amount of weight (around 2.96 kg), slightly more in the group using the AE cream. Their waist size also went down significantly, more so in the AE group. The thickness of their stomach fat also decreased significantly in both groups, although there was no significant difference between the two groups in that respect.

CONCLUSION.
Using AE cream can reduce stomach fat and waist size without causing any side effects.
