OBJECTIVE.
The aim of this study was to observe how two different treatments for type 2 diabetes, both affecting how insulin works in your body, can influence the occurrence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition that affects the nerves, causing numbness and pain, mostly in your hands and feet.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.
To find out, the researchers looked at how many people experienced this issue for the first time or already had the problem at the beginning of the study and then checked them over the course of 4 years. For the analysis, they used some advanced statistical methods.

RESULTS.
The study involved 2,159 participants (mostly men) with type 2 diabetes. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of how many people had the condition at the start. However, for those that did not have the condition at the beginning of the study, the group that had the insulin-sensitizing treatment showed fewer cases of new onset peripheral neuropathy over 4 years than the group that had the insulin-providing treatment, especially among men. This was independent of their blood glucose control throughout the trial.

CONCLUSIONS.
The results suggest that in patients with type 2 diabetes, getting the insulin-sensitizing treatment can reduce the chance of developing diabetic peripheral neuropathy than getting the insulin-providing treatment. This could be especially beneficial for men.
