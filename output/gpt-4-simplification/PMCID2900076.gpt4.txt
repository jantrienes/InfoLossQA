This study is about a procedure called Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), which is a knee replacement surgery. Usually, during the operation, a tourniquet is used to control bleeding, and any blood loss that occurs after the operation is collected in drains. 

Here, researchers are looking at the use of a drug called Tranexamic acid, which is known to reduce blood loss. The study involved patients who had one or both knees replaced. These patients were divided into two groups - one group was given a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect) and the other group got Tranexamic acid. 

The aim was to see if there was any change in postoperative blood loss, the need for blood transfusion, the cost-effectiveness of the procedure, and any complications that occurred during the recovery period. 

The findings showed that the group that received Tranexamic acid had less drainage fluid in their drains - both in patients who had one knee replaced and those who had both replaced. They also needed fewer blood transfusions than the group who got the placebo. 

No patient in either group developed deep vein thrombosis, a type of blood clot. The results show that Tranexamic acid can reduce blood loss by about 54% in patients having both knees replaced and 40% in those having one knee replaced. This can lead to significantly fewer blood transfusions (more than 80% less).
