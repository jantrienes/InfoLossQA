INTRODUCTION.
This study explores a type of treatment for balance problems and dizziness, which are common after head injuries and can be particularly tricky to manage in the first few months after the injury. The researchers looked at how well this treatment, called vestibular rehabilitation, helps in recovering from head injuries in the early stages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The participants were 20 people who had suffered head injuries and were experiencing dizziness and balance problems. They were split into two groups - one group was given medicine to help with the symptoms, while the other group was given the same medicine but also went through the vestibular rehabilitation treatment. This treatment was tailored to each individual person and was checked and approved by a team of specialists. To see how well the treatments worked, the researchers used a test called the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, which measures how much the dizziness and balance problems are affecting a person's life, both before the treatment and after.

RESULTS: 
When the study started, both groups of patients had similar physical conditions and scores on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory. But after one month of treatment, the group that went through the vestibular rehabilitation and took the medicine showed more improvement than the group that just took the medicine.

CONCLUSION. 
The study found that vestibular rehabilitation can help people who've had head injuries recover from dizziness and balance problems. It works better and faster when used together with medication.
