We checked the effects of Astaxanthin (Asx), a supplement, on athletes. When one exercises, it creates stress that affects the immune system, causes oxidation, injures the muscles and creates inflammation. Our focus was on how this supplement affects saliva immune response (sIgA) and oxidative stress in the bloodstream. We also checked other biochemical measures and the number of different types of white blood cells.

We carried out our study on forty trained male soccer players, splitting them randomly into two groups; one group took the supplement and the other did not act as a comparison.

We collected saliva and blood samples, both before they started taking Asx and after 90 days of its usage while at rest. We noticed the levels of sIgA increased after 90 days of usage and also that there was a reduction in the oxidant-antioxidant balance. The supplement was found to significantly lower the levels of enzymes related to muscle damage. The rise in a certain type of white blood cells (neutrophil) count and inflammation (hs-CRP level), were only found in the group that did not take the supplement, which shows that Asx could help to control the body's inflammatory responses to intense exercise.

In conclusion, our study shows that using Asx can boost the immune response in the saliva and protect against muscle damage, helping the body deal with inflammation caused by intense, physical training. We also suggest further use of Asx in situations where the body has a weaker immune response, or when there are high levels of oxidative stress and inflammation.
