BACKGROUND.
This study looks at how social media can be used to encourage young adults to quit smoking. Previous attempts to change people's behavior - like quitting smoking - through social media haven't been very successful because people didn't really engage with them. We're trying a new approach in this study, using a model that helps people to change their behavior and creating content on Facebook that suits each person's willingness to quit.

OBJECTIVE.
The aim of the study is to find out which content, based on this behavioral change model, gets the most responses from people who are thinking about quitting smoking, but haven't started the process yet.

METHODS.
We involved 79 people who smoke in the study (mostly men, with an average age of around 21 years old). They were assessed to find out how ready they were to quit smoking, then put into one of 7 private Facebook groups. These groups were tailored to their readiness to quit. A member of the research team would post daily content matching their readiness level for three months. We measured the success of the posts by how many comments they got.

RESULTS.
The 512 posts got a total of 630 comments. For those who weren't planning on quitting within the month, posts asking them to weigh the pros and cons of changing their behavior got the most comments. For people who were getting ready to quit, posts raising awareness about smoking issues got the most comments. No matter what time or day the posts were published, the engagement levels dropped over time and varied between the different groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
Participants who weren't planning to quit anytime soon engaged the most with posts asking them to think about the good and bad sides of changing their behavior. Those getting ready to quit liked posts about facts related to smoking and how to quit. This supports the idea of using material based on how ready someone is to quit smoking. Certain types of content seem to work better in getting people engaged on social media.
