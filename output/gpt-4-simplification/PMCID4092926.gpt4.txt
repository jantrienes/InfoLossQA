This study was trying to find out how well sunflower cake could replace soybean meal in the food given to young goats. We had 32 young goats, each weighing around 15 kilograms, and they were each kept in their own pens. We tried out four different diets, varying the amount of soybean meal replaced by sunflower cake (0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%). 

At the end of the study, we found that no matter how much sunflower cake we used in place of soybean meal, the goats' overall size, leg dimensions, amount of muscle, fat and bone weight, and muscle-to-fat ratios stayed about the same. 

So, it seems sunflower cake can be fully used in place of soybean meal in goat food without any noticeable changes in how the goats grow.
