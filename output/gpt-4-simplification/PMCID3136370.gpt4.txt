This study looked at whether using soy products could help people with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body, to feel better. The researchers randomly divided 50 people with fibromyalgia into two groups. One group drank a soy shake every day, and the other group drank a placebo shake (containing casein, a protein found in milk) that didn't contain any soy. They compared how the two groups were doing both before the study started and after six weeks of drinking the shakes.

The main result was that both groups felt somewhat better after six weeks, but there was no real difference between the people who drank the soy shakes and those who drank the placebo shakes. The researchers concluded that, based on these results, there's probably no point in doing bigger studies to see whether soy is useful for people with fibromyalgia, because it didn't seem to make a difference in this study.
