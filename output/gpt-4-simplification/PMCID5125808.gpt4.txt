PURPOSE.
This study was done to check how well CKD-828, a mix of two blood pressure medicines, works and how safe it is for patients with high blood pressure who did not respond well to treatment with only one of these drugs (S-amlodipine).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
We tested 187 patients who still had high blood pressure after taking S-amlodipine for 4 weeks. They were given either CKD-828 in two different doses, or they continued on S-amlodipine. This was done for 8 weeks. We then compared how well the two treatments worked by looking at changes in blood pressure. Side effects, changes in vital signs, and physical exam results were looked at for safety.

RESULTS.
After 8 weeks, all treatments helped to lower blood pressure. However, the CKD-828 treatment in both doses worked better than S-amlodipine alone, both at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. There were also fewer side effects with one dose of CKD-828 compared to S-amlodipine. Increasing the dose of one component of CKD-828 did not lead to any unexpected side effects, indicating that it is safe.

CONCLUSION.
CKD-828 seems to be both effective and safe for patients with high blood pressure who haven't seen enough improvement with S-amlodipine alone.
