This study compares two types of implants used to fix broken hips in older people. The research looked at 165 patients who had a specific type of hip fracture, over a two-year period. They were divided into two groups: group A had one type of implant (the sliding hip screw) and group B had a different type (cephalomedullary nails). We compared a number of factors including time until and duration of surgery, how long they stayed in the hospital, any complications related to the implants, whether they needed a blood transfusion, if the surgery had to be repeated, how well they recovered, and if they died during the time of the study. 

The main findings were that surgery was faster but required more x-ray imaging for group B. There were no broken thigh bones during surgery. Both groups had similar scores for recovery, repeat surgery, and death rates. However, we noticed a new complication in the group treated with cephalomedullary nails, named as the Z-effect. 

After comparing these two types of implants, we didn't see any significant differences between the SHS and the cephalomedullary nail for this specific kind of hip fracture, including outcomes, complications, and death rates. Therefore, we can't recommend one implant over the other based on our study.
