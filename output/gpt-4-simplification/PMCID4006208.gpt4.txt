BACKGROUND.
There's a growing problem with antibiotics not working as effectively, and more people are experiencing oral diseases. This study was to see if Aloe vera mouthwash could help with oral health issues, particularly dental plaque. Specifically, we wanted to see how Aloe vera mouthwash worked over four days, compared to the usual mouthwash (chlorhexidine) and a mouthwash that isn't supposed to do anything (saline water).

Material and Methods.
300 healthy volunteers were split into three equal groups. One group used Aloe vera mouthwash, another used chlorhexidine mouthwash (the usual stuff), and the third used saline water (which doesn't do anything). At the start, we tested the health of everyone's gums (ginigval index) and how much plaque they had (plaque index). We then cleaned everyone's teeth professionally so everyone started with no plaque. For the next four days, the volunteers only used their assigned mouthwash, without brushing or flossing. 

RESULTS.
The study found that both the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash were equally good at reducing plaque over those four days. Meanwhile, the saline water didn't do much (as expected). The difference in plaque reduction between the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash wasn't significant enough to matter. Also, no one reported any bad side effects from the Aloe vera mouthwash.

CONCLUSION.
Based on this study, Aloe vera could be a good alternative mouthwash. It was successful in reducing dental plaque, just as effective as the usual chlorhexidine mouthwash, but without any side effects.
