BACKGROUND.
This study looks at how two pain relievers, morphine and tramadol, are used after minor knee surgery.

OBJECTIVES. 
The goal of the study was to see which painkiller, morphine or tramadol, was better at reducing pain after minor knee surgery. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS. 
The study involved 132 patients who were getting minor knee surgery. They were randomly chosen to receive either morphine or tramadol. Their pain levels were measured before surgery (when they were at rest and when they moved their knee) and after surgery. This was done at various times after the surgery. At the same time, the study looked at when the patients first asked for more pain relief and if they needed extra painkillers.

RESULTS. 
There was no big difference in the pain levels of the two groups before the surgery. Even after the surgery, the pain levels in both groups didn't differ too much. An exception was found one hour after the surgery when the patients given tramadol had less pain. The study also found that six hours after using the pain relievers, the pain levels in both groups dropped significantly. 

CONCLUSIONS. 
The study found that both morphine and tramadol reduced pain after minor knee surgery, with the most noticeable effect happening six hours after they were administered.
