BACKGROUND.
This research looks at the effectiveness of certain drugs that are typically used for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in young people. The study particularly compares two drugs: lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH).

OBJECTIVE.
We studied and compared the effects of LDX and OROS-MPH on ADHD symptoms in teenagers.

METHODS.
Teenagers diagnosed with ADHD participated in two separate studies. In one 8-week study, the dose was flexible and in another 6-week study, the dose was fixed. We measured the changes in their ADHD symptoms at the end of each study. We also tracked any side effects as well as their vital signs.

RESULTS.
The results showed that both LDX and OROS-MPH improved ADHD symptoms more than a placebo (a dummy pill). But, LDX had a slightly better result in the fixed-dose study, whereas in the flexible-dose study, there wasn't much difference between LDX and OROS-MPH. We also found common side effects, including loss of appetite, weight loss, sleep problems, dry mouth, and minor infections. The drugs also slightly increased blood pressure and heart rate.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our findings show that LDX was more effective than OROS-MPH in the fixed-dose study, but not in the flexible-dose study. Both drugs were safe and similar findings have been reported in previous studies. Both types of drugs were effective in treating ADHD symptoms in teenagers.
