BACKGROUND:
Many drug users go to their regular doctors asking for help to stop using illegal drugs. There are many medicines available to help with this, but no one is sure which is the best. This study compares two drugs, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which is better at helping people stop using illegal drugs.

METHODS:
This study included 60 adults in Leeds, UK, who were using illegal drugs and wanted to stop. They were randomly chosen to receive either buprenorphine or dihydrocodeine. The way the drugs were reduced over time depended on what the prescribing doctor thought was best, but it was not supposed to be more than 15 days. The main goal was to see if the person stopped using illegal drugs by the end of the treatment, which was checked by a urine test. They also looked at what happened during the treatment and three and six months afterwards.

RESULTS:
Only 23% of the people finished their drug detox treatment and gave a urine sample at the end. If people were given buprenorphine, they were more likely to finish the detox treatment. Those given buprenorphine were also more likely to have a clean urine sample, meaning they stopped using illegal drugs. They also needed to see healthcare professionals less often during treatment and more were still not using drugs three and six months later.

CONCLUSION:
With help, it is possible to set up good quality trials in the regular healthcare setting for people using drugs. This small study provides completely new data on how to use these treatments.
