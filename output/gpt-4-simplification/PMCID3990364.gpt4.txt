BACKGROUND.
As women get older, they may find that their back isn't as flexible as it used to be. This lack of movement can create challenges when they are trying to do everyday tasks. While some studies have suggested that doing exercises to improve spinal flexibility can help, there's still a lot we don't know about the best way to structure these exercises. In this study, we wanted to find out if an eight-week program designed to improve spinal flexibility could increase the range of motion in the back for older women.

METHODS.
We got our participants from a senior center in Palermo and split them into two groups: a trained group and a control group. The trained group consisted of 19 women who followed the eight-week exercise program, which they did twice a week. Each exercise session had a ten-minute warm-up, followed by a 50-minute workout and ending with a ten-minute cool-down. The control group, who did not participate in any physical activities, consisted of 18 women. To measure spinal flexibility, we took readings of their back's range of movement at the start and end of the eight weeks using a special device.

RESULTS.
After the eight weeks, the women who did the exercises saw an average improvement of 16.4% in their forward bending, 29.2% in their back-and-hips bending, and 22.5% in their chest area bending. However, there was no significant improvement in the lower back region.

CONCLUSION.
The results suggest that an eight-week flexibility exercise program can indeed improve the flexibility of elderly womenâ€™s backs. This program also seems suitable for older adults who can take care of themselves and stay active.
