BACKGROUND.
We know that a medicine called butylphthalide sodium chloride injection can help people who've just had a certain type of stroke, but we don't know exactly how it works. We think it might help reduce inflammation and boost the immune system by affecting a particular group of glands in the body (the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands).

OBJECTIVE.
We want to see what effect this medicine has on these glands when given to people who've just had this type of stroke.

METHODS.
We split patients into two groups: one got the medicine through an IV drip and the other didn't. We then measured their hormone levels and used a standard test to check on their stroke symptoms. We did this a few times after they had the stroke.

RESULTS.
After two weeks, we found that both groups had higher than normal levels of two specific hormones. However, the group who got the medicine had lower levels of these hormones and better scores on the stroke test than the group who didn't get the medicine.

CONCLUSION.
Giving this medicine to people who've just had this type of stroke can improve their condition by lessening the negative impacts on these glands in the body.
