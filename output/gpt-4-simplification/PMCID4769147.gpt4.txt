GOAL OF THE STUDY.
Breastfeeding is good for a baby's health and overall wellbeing-- but not enough women do it. We wanted to see if giving newborns a small amount of baby formula right after birth would hurt or help breastfeeding rates. We also wanted to know whether this approach would hinder breastfeeding when the baby is three or six months old.

HOW THE STUDY WAS DONE.
We picked 104 healthy babies that had lost more than 5% of their birth weight and were between one and two days old. We split them into two groups. In one group, we gave the babies 10 ml of baby formula feed after each breastfeeding session (this was stopped as soon as the mother's milk came in). The other group followed the standard approach. We tracked breastfeeding rates when the babies left the hospital, and then checked in when they were three and six months old.

WHAT WE FOUND.
In both groups, 50 newborns were examined. The groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical characteristics. There was no noticeable difference in breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge, at three months, or at six months between the two groups. One thing that did differ, was the amount of weight the babies lost in the hospital - babies in the standard approach lost more weight.

WHAT THIS MEANS.
Our study shows that giving newborns a small amount of baby formula feed doesn't seem to hurt breastfeeding rates in the short or long term. More studies need to be done to see if this approach can help more moms breastfeed and keep breastfeeding for longer.

TRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS.
The study is registered with the ISRCTN under the number ISRCTN61915183.
