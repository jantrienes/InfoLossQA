In 2010, around 79 million Americans, over half of whom were over 65, had a condition called prediabetes. The best way to prevent this condition turning into full diabetes is through lifestyle changes, like maintaining a regular exercise routine and eating healthy foods. However, these changes can be tough due to emotional struggles such as stress and low mood, particularly in older people who also face mobility issues.

Our study investigated if a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) could help. We ran a trial with 154 people, both men and women aged between 41 and 71, who were randomly selected to receive either no supplement, a 15 mg dose, or a 50 mg dose. We also checked their mood and stress levels. We found no previous research on this topic.

The results showed that taking 5-ALA helped improve people's ability to cope and how they felt about the effort they were making, and it reduced feelings of loneliness. The 50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose. After 12 weeks of taking the supplement, people's mood and coping abilities were much better. 

This could be a breakthrough for prediabetic individuals, as it could help them overcome the emotional struggles that often get in the way of them adopting healthier habits, ultimately assisting them in preventing full diabetes.
