The goal of this research was to compare a newly developed bone marrow device with the regular bone marrow needle. The study took place in a teaching hospital, with medical trainees overseen by experienced doctors and a research technician. The new device, called the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, is powered by a battery-operated drill to insert its needle.

The research carried out 54 bone marrow tests, half done with the standard needle and half done with the new OnControl device. The main goal measured was the average length of the bone marrow samples taken out, as longer samples usually mean better quality. The ones taken out by the OnControl device were, on average, over half as long again as the ones taken out with the regular needle.

The researchers also timed the procedures and found that the OnControl device completed its tests significantly faster than the regular needle did. Other measures also favored the OnControl device. There were only a few minor problems in both groups of tests.

Therefore, the researchers concluded that bone marrow tests carried out by doctors-in-training are faster and provide better results when the OnControl device is used compared to the regular needle. Consequently, this device could be favored as a new norm for adult patients needing hematology, and it is a better tool for teaching medical trainees in hematology.
