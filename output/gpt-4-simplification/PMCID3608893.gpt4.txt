OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study is to see how effective a ready-to-eat, portion-controlled diet is on weight and blood sugar levels over six months in overweight patients with Type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We had 100 participants on average about 55 years old, weighing about 102.9 kilos, with a blood sugar level of 7.7%. They were placed randomly into two groups. One group used the portion-controlled diet as part of a nine-session lifestyle program, while the other group had a nine-session program focused on teaching them to manage Type-2 diabetes. Both groups had the same goals for daily calorie intake (1250-1550 calories) and weekly exercise (200 minutes).

RESULTS
On the whole, both groups improved in weight and blood sugar levels after 6 months. However, those on the portion-controlled diet lost an average of 7.3 kilos compared to 2.2 kilos in the diabetes management group. More people in the portion-controlled diet group lost at least 5% of their starting weight and 10% of their starting weight. Blood sugar levels also decreased more in the portion-controlled group compared to the diabetes management group. Across both groups, the more weight lost, the better the decrease in blood sugar levels.

CONCLUSION
The findings show that ready-to-eat, portion-controlled meals can significantly improve weight and blood sugar control in overweight people with Type 2 diabetes. These results matter to doctors and health services who want to help patients deal with being overweight.
