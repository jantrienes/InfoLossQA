There's a certain substance located at the center of the human eye called the "macula." This substance is made up of three components that we get from our diet. Some studies suggest that these components protect our eyes from age-related damage. Therefore, these components are often included in dietary supplements. 

In this study, we gave two different types of these supplements to two groups of 24 people over a period of 24 weeks. One group took a supplement containing one of the three components, while the other group took a supplement containing all three. 

At the end of the study, we found that the group who took the supplement containing all three components had a greater increase in the levels of the macular substance in their eyes, especially among the older participants. 

In general, participants who had higher levels of this macular substance at the start of the study had a smaller increase in levels, but this was only true for those in the group taking the supplement with all three components. 

The gender of the participants did not seem to affect the results. We also did not find any effect from the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs by a few of the older participants.
