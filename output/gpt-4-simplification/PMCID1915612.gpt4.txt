OBJECTIVES
Many people who have long-term neck pain after a whiplash injury find it hard to manage, as do the healthcare professionals and insurance companies involved in their care. One possible treatment for this pain is a drug called botulinum toxin, but good quality research is lacking on its effectiveness. So, we ran a scientifically robust study to find out if botulinum toxin really does help reduce neck pain in these patients.

METHODS
We had 40 patients who all had long-term whiplash injury. They were randomly put into two groups. One group had injections of botulinum toxin and the other group had injections of a harmless saltwater solution (the placebo) into their painful neck muscles.

RESULTS
We checked on the patients after 12 weeks and found no big differences between the two groups. We looked at how intense their neck pain was, how many days they had neck pain, how many hours a day they had neck pain, how many days they needed treatment to relieve their symptoms, how many painkillers they took each day, and how much they could move their necks. There was also no big difference in how much the patients felt they had improved over the 4, 8 and 12 weeks of the study.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on our results, we couldn't say that botulinum toxin is effective in treating neck pain in people with long-term whiplash. It seems that having tender muscles might not be the main cause of this kind of neck pain.
