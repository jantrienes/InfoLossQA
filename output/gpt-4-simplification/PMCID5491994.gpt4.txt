In ear, nose, and throat medicine, not many patients go on with elective surgeries (procedures you choose to have) to help issues like a deviated septum or a blocked sinus passage. Itâ€™s important for patients to understand their diagnosis and treatment plan because it leads to better health outcomes and quality of life. In this study, we used advanced 3D printing methods to create a model of the human nasal sinus, based on clinical X-ray data. This model can be used to help doctors explain to patients about their health during consultations. We made sure the model's material, anatomical accuracy, and overall appearance are optimized. 

We did a study where 50 ear, nose, and throat surgery candidates (and a comparison group of 50) were told about their anatomy, disease, and treatment options with the help of this model. The patients who saw the 3D model had significantly better opinions about their doctor's explanation of their treatment options and rated themselves higher in understanding their anatomy, disease, and the effectiveness of the model. This shows that the 3D model is a useful tool for doctors to educate and interact with their patients.
