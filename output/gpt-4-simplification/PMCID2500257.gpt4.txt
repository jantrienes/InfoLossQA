This study is about a test called PNA-FISH, which can tell the difference between a specific bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, and other similar bacteria in blood samples. Out of 202 patients with positive blood cultures, half were randomly chosen to have their test results shared with their doctor. Those who had their test results shared had a lower death rate (8% compared to 17%) and used fewer antibiotics (about 2.5 days less). They also showed a tendency to have shorter hospital stays and lower medical bills.
