Scientists have been testing a new nicotine vaccine, called NicVAX®, to see if it can help smokers quit. They wanted to know if more of the vaccine in the body leads to better quit rates and if giving more doses of the vaccine increases its effectiveness.

They conducted a study with 301 smokers, where some received either 200 or 400 μg doses of the vaccine, four or five times over six months, and others received a fake form of the vaccine (placebo). They found out that those who had the most significant immune response to the vaccine (the top 30%) were more likely to quit smoking for at least eight weeks compared to those who took the placebo (24.6% vs. 12.0%).

Interestingly, those who had the regimen of five shots of the higher dose (400 μg) were more likely to quit smoking than the placebo group too.

So, this study shows that NicVAX® can stimulate the body to produce nicotine antibodies and help smokers quit. This encourages further research to develop the vaccine as a potential treatment for nicotine addiction.
