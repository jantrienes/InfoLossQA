GOAL:
We wanted to see how fizzy water affects the hard outer layer of your teeth, which we call 'enamel'. We also wanted to figure out whether the effect changes based on how fizzy the water is and whether or not it contains calcium.

WHAT WE DID:
We made fizzy water with different levels of carbonation. We then took 75 pre-molar teeth and split them into a control group and four test groups. The groups were divided based on the fizziness of the water and whether or not it contained calcium. The first group was not exposed to anything, the second had its enamel etched (like being scratched), and the third was sealed. This process took place over seven days, with each group submerged in the fizzy water for fifteen minutes, three times a day. After that, we tested the hardness of the enamel and looked at the enamel under a high-powered microscope, using a selection of teeth from each group.

WHAT WE FOUND:
Enamel hardness changed significantly across the groups. In all test groups, the hardness of the enamel decreased more than in the control group, except in the group exposed to lightly fizzy water with calcium. We found that fizzy water destroyed the etched areas of the teeth and the extent of this destruction differed between groups. The fizzy water also partially removed a sticky material we applied to the teeth.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
Our research shows that fizzy water can harm the tough enamel layer of your teeth, making it softer and removing applied adhesive. The harm varies depending on how fizzy the water is and whether it contains calcium.
