BACKGROUND.
This research looked at how well infants with a common lung infection called bronchiolitis responded to different combinations of medicines. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study investigated the effects on babies between 1 to 12 months old. The babies were divided into four groups and were given different combinations of drugs. The major goal was to see if combining these drugs could reduce the need for hospital stays. 

RESULTS.
The study showed that the combination of dexamethasone and epinephrine resulted in the same number of hospital admissions as the other combinations. This was also the case for the combination of dexamethasone and salbutamol. However, the babies receiving these combinations showed improvements in their breathing and heart rates. 

CONCLUSIONS.
The study concluded that this does not support the use of corticosteroids (like dexamethasone) in managing bronchiolitis in young first-time wheezing infants.
