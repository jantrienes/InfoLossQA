This study aimed to compare how effective two different positions (lateral decubitus or on their side, and supine or laying flat on their back) were during a hip fracture treatment called Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) in 120 elderly Chinese patients. 

In simple terms, these patients were randomly divided into two groups and treated while in different positions. Measures they looked at included the patients' length of hospital stay, surgery time, blood loss during surgery, size of the surgical cut, length of time the X-ray was used during surgery, and the time it took for patients to get out of bed after surgery. 

Results showed that all these were significantly less in the group that had surgery while lying on their side compared to those who had surgery while lying flat on their back. However, they also found there was no major difference between the groups regarding the time it took for the fracture to heal and the overall hip health after surgery.

Notably, they found fewer complications in the group that had surgery while lying on their side. Only surface wound infections were noticed in this group, while the group who had surgery while lying on their back experienced more severe issues such as deep vein blood clots and deep wound infections.

Overall, their findings suggest that PFNA treatment can be effective for elderly patients with this type of hip fracture, and having the surgery while lying on one's side may lead to better results and fewer complications.
