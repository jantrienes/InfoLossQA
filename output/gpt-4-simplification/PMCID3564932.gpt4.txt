BACKGROUND.
Sometimes, doctors need to induce labor in pregnant women, which means they have to artificially start the labor process. This is a common procedure that affects both the woman and the health care system. One way to reduce the impact, is to carry out the procedure in an outpatient setting, meaning the patient can go home after the procedure instead of staying at the hospital. There's not much information on how outpatient and inpatient inductions compare, and also some safety worries if outpatient inductions use a certain medication used in inpatient settings. This study is aiming to see if it's feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients to induce labor in an outpatient setting using a Foley catheter, compared to inpatient inductions using vaginal PGE2.

METHODS.
In the study, 101 women who needed labor induced were split into two groups. 50 women were in the outpatient group and used a Foley catheter for induction. These women were able to go home overnight after a reassuring test. The other 51 women were in the inpatient group and used vaginal PGE2 for induction. The main things checked were how long the hospital stay was, how the baby was born, how long it took from induction to delivery, any side effects, and how satisfied the patients were.

RESULTS.
Women in the outpatient group spent less time in the hospital before giving birth, but those in the inpatient group were more likely to have a vaginal birth within 12 hours of going to the Birthing Unit. Overall vaginal birth rates, the time from induction to delivery, and total time spent in the hospital were almost the same for both groups. However, the outpatient group felt less pain and had better sleep but were more likely need additional labor induction.

CONCLUSIONS.
Outpatient labor induction was feasible and acceptable for women who are not in a good condition to give birth naturally, however, it did not show a significant reduction in total time spent in the hospital and was associated with increased need for labor induction.
