BACKGROUND.
Controlling pain after surgery is a big challenge in the world of health care. Too many patients do not have their pain effectively controlled, which not only causes them unnecessary suffering but could also lead to other health problems. Proper use of pain relief methods can prevent or at least decrease this unnecessary suffering and these extra health issues.

OBJECTIVES.
We wanted to compare how well two different methods of giving local anesthetic drugs continuously could control pain after hip surgery. The drugs were given either beside the spinal column (paravertebral) or into the space around the spinal column (epidural).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Our study involved 60 people getting hip surgery. They were split into 2 groups of 30. One group had a single dose of spinal anesthesia plus a continuous flow of the anesthetic drug beside the spinal column. The other group had the same single dose of spinal anesthesia but a continuous flow of the drug into the space around the spinal column instead. We then compared the levels of pain, basic health measurements, need for additional pain relief, and the time taken to do the procedure between the two groups.

RESULTS.
On average, the group getting the drug into the space around the spinal column had lower blood pressure from 2 hours after the drug was started until 48 hours later. It also took longer to give the anesthetic this way. However, there were no differences in the frequency of surgical complications between the two groups or in the problems related to where the drug was given.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our study suggests that continuously giving local anesthetic beside the spinal column or into the space around it both can control pain effectively after hip surgery. However, giving it beside the spinal column might be advantageous in certain ways.
