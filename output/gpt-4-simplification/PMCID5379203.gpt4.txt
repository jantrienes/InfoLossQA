This is a study comparing two ways of handling patients who might have Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS), which is a sleep disorder that causes your throat muscles to relax and block your airway during sleep. 

The study had two groups. Group A patients were looked after at home. Group B patients were treated in a hospital. Both groups of patients were given CPAP, a machine used for treating sleep apnea, for three months. 

The goal of the study was to see if there was a difference in the patients' sleepiness score but the study found no difference between the two groups. However, those treated at home reported a better improvement in their sleep quality and life quality.

In terms of cost and waiting time, the home-based approach was significantly better. It was cheaper by about USD 1770 per patient and also reduced waiting times by about 5-6 months from their first doctor visit to getting the CPAP machine.

Therefore, this study suggests that treating patients with suspected OSAS at home can be as effective as treating them in the hospital. Plus it saves money and time.
