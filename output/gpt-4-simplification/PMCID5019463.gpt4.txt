PURPOSE.
This study looked at how having a 'patient navigator' - a person who helps guide a patient through their healthcare journey - could change how regularly patients with glaucoma go to their follow-up eye check-ups. This is important because missed appointments can lead to worse vision problems. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS. 
The study used people who were diagnosed with some form of glaucoma after taking an eye test in Philadelphia, USA. These people were put into three groups for one year: one group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator, the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator, and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator. Then, they compared how well each group stuck to their appointment schedule. 

RESULTS.
155 patients were included in this study. They were generally around 71 years old, mostly women, and primarily African-American. The number of follow-up visits during the year was about the same between the three groups. Around 70% to 82% of patients in all groups attended at least one follow-up visit. When looking at only the people who attended two or more follow-up visits, the group with a patient navigator within the community had the highest turn out. 

CONCLUSION.
Even though having a patient navigator didn't make people more likely to go to an office for their check-ups, people did have a decent rate of attendance at their follow-up visits on their own. It is unclear if the community-based care with a navigator helped with the higher rate of attendance for two or more check-ups, which suggests more study is needed.
