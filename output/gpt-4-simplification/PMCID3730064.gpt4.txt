PURPOSE.
This study aims to compare the short-term effects of two kinds of injections, namely, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, on the shrinking of unusual blood vessels in the cornea (the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the eye).

METHODS.
Sixteen patients suffering from abnormal blood vessels in the cornea were randomly chosen to receive one of either a bevacizumab or ranibizumab injection. They were checked before the injection, a week after the injection, and a month after the injection to measure how much their blood vessels shrunk. 

RESULTS.
The patients, aged around 51, developed abnormal blood vessels in the cornea due to various reasons like eye infections or chemical burns. After the bevacizumab injection, a clear reduction in unusual blood vessels was noticed both a week and a month after the treatment. The ranibizumab injection also resulted in reduced abnormal vessels after a week, but the change was not significant a month later. In group 1, treated with bevacizumab, the shrinkage in unusual vessels was significantly higher than in group 2, treated with ranibizumab.

CONCLUSIONS.
The study concluded that bevacizumab injection was more effective in reducing the unusual blood vessel growth in the cornea compared to the ranibizumab injection. However, further research is needed to understand the effectiveness and the right dosage of these two treatments.
