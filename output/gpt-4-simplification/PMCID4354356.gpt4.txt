This study looked into how heroin use affects the brain, specifically the striatal brain regions. It's known that when someone first starts using drugs, a part of the brain known as the striatum assists in creating a feeling of reward. As the drug addiction progresses, the reward effect may lessen and be replaced by different effects. 

The researchers used an imaging technique known as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the brains of long-term heroin users. They compared the brain activity of these patients when they took heroin and when they took a placebo, to a group of healthy individuals who only took a placebo. 

They found that heroin increased the connectivity in a part of the brain called the left putamen, which led the patients to feel a "rush". This feeling was positively linked to the level of morphine (derived from heroin) in their blood. However, in healthy individuals, a different part of the brain became more active compared to the patients when they took placebo.

In conclusion, their findings suggest that the feeling of reward after using heroin still occurs in long-term users, because of increased connectivity in certain parts of the brain.
