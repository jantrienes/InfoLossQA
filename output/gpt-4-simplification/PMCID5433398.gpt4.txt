BACKGROUND.
People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often require care from many different doctors, which can create a complex system for managing their health. We don't yet know the best way to organize this type of team-based care.

OBJECTIVE.
This study aims to find out if coordinating these multiple specialists in an integrated approach is more effective than the regular forms of care for MS patients.

METHODS.
We conducted a study with MS patients, comparing two different methods of care. The first method was a new, integrated team approach where the patients would spend a half-day at the MS clinic going through a comprehensive personal health assessment. The second method was the normal standard of care. We looked at how these two methods affected patients' quality of life (QoL), which was measured with a specific scale, at the start of the trial and after six months.

RESULTS.
We involved 50 MS patients in our study. At the end of six months, the regular care group's quality of life score decreased a little, while the integrated care group's quality of life score increased a little. This difference looked significant at first glance. But, when we adjusted for other variables, the difference didn't stand out.

CONCLUSIONS.
This is the first study trying to evaluate the use of a team-based approach to care for MS patients. Contrary to what we thought, the results show that coordinating multiple specialists in an integrated approach doesn't seem to make a big difference in improving quality of life compared to regular care.
