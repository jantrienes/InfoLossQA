This study is about the use of lavender oil and linalyl acetate to help manage pain and urinary problems after surgery for colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum, and these surgeries often come with unpleasant side effects. One of the most common procedures is placing a tube in the bladder, which can cause discomfort and issues with urination when removed.

The researchers looked at 66 patients who had this kind of surgery and tube placement. They were split into three groups, and each group inhaled either lavender oil, linalyl acetate (another substance found in many plants), or a control substance for 20 minutes. 

The scientists checked things like blood pressure, heart rate, urinary issues, pain level, and overall satisfaction with life concerning urinary symptoms before and after this inhalation. They didn't see any differences in heart rate, blood pressure, or overall life satisfaction related to urinary symptoms across the three groups.

However, they found two key differences among the groups. The patients who inhaled linalyl acetate reported less pain and less discomfort from remnants of the bladder tube than the other groups. 

In simple words, the study suggests that inhaling linalyl acetate can help manage pain and discomfort related to bladder tube removal after colorectal cancer surgery.
