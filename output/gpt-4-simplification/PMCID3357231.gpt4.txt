GOAL
We wanted to see if replacing regular sugar with isomaltulose (another type of sugar) in sweet foods and drinks would help manage blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

HOW WE DID IT
We asked 110 people with type 2 diabetes to eat sweet foods that either had isomaltulose or regular sugar in them every day for 12 weeks. They did this as part of their regular diet. We looked at their HbA1c levels (a measure of blood sugar) at the end of the 12 weeks.

WHAT WE FOUND
Out of 101 people we could finally analyze, replacing regular sugar with isomaltulose didn't make a difference to their HbA1c levels at 12 weeks. Therefore, it didn't seem to help control their blood sugar levels. However, we did find that the group that ate foods with isomaltulose had significantly lower levels of triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) at 12 weeks.

CONCLUSION
Eating isomaltulose instead of regular sugar didn't help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. But it was linked to lower levels of triglycerides.
