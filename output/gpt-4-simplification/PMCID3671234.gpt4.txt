Spinal anesthesia is often used during surgeries below the belly button, like a C-section or a hernia operation. But one of the pain-relief medicine's biggest drawbacks is that it doesn't work for long after surgery. Several other medicines have been tried with the aim of making it last longer. In this study, we wanted to see what effect the drug midazolam would have if used along with the anesthetic in these lower body surgeries.

The study involved 90 adult patients, aged 18 to 60, who were already scheduled for such a surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group was given the normal anesthetic along with a saline solution. The second group received the same anesthetic, but with midazolam added.

Our findings showed that adding midazolam to the anesthetic used in spinal anesthesia made the pain relief last longer (on average, 320 minutes compared to 220 minutes) and also made the numbness last longer (averaging 255 minutes versus 195 minutes). It also reduced the occurrence of nausea and vomiting after surgery.
