BACKGROUND.
A study was carried out to see how safe and effective the drug formoterol is for patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard for a person to breathe. 

METHODS.
This tested the drug on patients aged 40 years and over across multiple countries. The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. 

RESULTS.
613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo. They also reduced the reliever medication use a lot more than those taking placebo. The drug formoterol was well accepted and the side effects were not significantly different in any of the groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
The study found that formoterol is effective and safe for COPD patients. Two doses of the drug were tested and although both were helpful, the higher dose seemed to have more benefits for some patients.

TRIAL REGISTRATION.
The study was registered under the numbers NCT00628862 on ClinicalTrials.gov and D5122C00001 as AstraZeneca's study code.
