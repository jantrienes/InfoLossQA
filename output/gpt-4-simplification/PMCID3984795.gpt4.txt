We ran a study with 60 adults who were a bit overweight but otherwise healthy, all between 40 and 60 years old. The aim was to see the effects of probiotics (specifically, VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acids on our bodyâ€™s response to insulin, cholesterol levels in the blood, and inflammation. 

Participants were randomly sorted into four groups. The first group was given a placebo; the second group took omega-3 fatty acids; the third group took the probiotic VSL#3; the fourth group had both omega-3 and the probiotic, for a period of 6 weeks. We collected blood and stool samples at the start and end of the study.

The group that took the probiotic VSL#3 showed a significant reduction in bad cholesterol and triglycerides, along with an increase in good cholesterol. This probiotic also improved the body's response to insulin (which reduces risk of diabetes), reduced inflammation, and positively changed gut bacteria composition. 

Omega-3 alone improved the body's response to insulin and reduced inflammation, but didn't appear to affect gut bacteria. However, when omega-3 was used with VSL#3, the effects on good cholesterol, body's response to insulin, and inflammation were more pronounced.

We noticed that people with low amounts of good cholesterol, insulin resistance, and high inflammation had worse gut bacteria composition. They had significantly less 'good' bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and more of some specific 'bad' bacteria (E. coli and Bacteroides).
