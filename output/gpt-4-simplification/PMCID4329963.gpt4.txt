BACKGROUND:
This study looks at how involving families in the treatment process can help drug users get better, experience fewer side effects, and improve their quality of life.

OBJECTIVES:
The aim was to see if educating drug users and their families, using methods grounded in empowerment and health promotion, could enhance their lifestyles and improve their overall health.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
We tested this on drug users who were getting treatment at a medical center in Tehran. They were split up into three groups: one group of the drug users themselves, one group of their family members, and a third control group. We asked them a series of questions about their lifestyle, health, self confidence, emotions, social support, and potential obstacles.

RESULTS:
After adjusting for previous test scores, there was a significant improvement in the lifestyle, health, and other areas for the drug users and their families who went through the empowerment program. The control group didn't see these changes.

CONCLUSIONS:
Using a family-centered empowerment approach with drug users and their families is possible and can lead to better health, improved lifestyle, and more positive attitudes towards health.
