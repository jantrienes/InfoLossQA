BACKGROUND.
Obesity is a big issue worldwide. In our search for food that can help tackle obesity, we found that rosehip extract can help reduce weight gain and cut down belly fat, as shown in tests on mice. Now, we want to see if it works on humans too, in people who are a little overweight.

METHODS.
We ran a 12-week experiment involving 32 people who were slightly overweight. They were divided into two groups, with one group given a placebo (dummy pill), and the other given a rosehip tablet containing 100mg of rosehip extract. They took one pill every day for 12 weeks, and didnâ€™t change their eating habits. We looked at changes in belly fat and body fat percentage mainly, as well as any changes in body weight and BMI (body mass index).

RESULTS.
Those in the rosehip group lost a significant amount of belly fat, weight, and had a lower BMI by the end of the 12 weeks. These reductions were much more significant compared to the placebo group. There was also a trend towards a lower body fat percentage in the rosehip group. Moreover, the fat just under the skin in the belly area was significantly lower in the rosehip group than the placebo group by week 12. Also, there were no health problems reported during the study.

CONCLUSION.
These findings suggest that rosehip extract might be a good potential food item to help prevent obesity.
