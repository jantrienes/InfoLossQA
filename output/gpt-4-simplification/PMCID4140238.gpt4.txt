PURPOSE.
The purpose of this study was to assess how effective a new antihistamine eye drop (BBOS 1.5%) is at treating eye allergy symptoms.

METHODS.
The research team conducted two trials with the same design involving 157 participants, either using the antihistamine drop (78 participants) or a placebo (79 participants). The participants were given a drop in both eyes during different visits, either 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours before being exposed to a common eye allergen. The main traits measured were changes in eye itching and redness at various time intervals after the exposure. Other measurements including swelling, tearing, and other forms of redness were also considered.

RESULTS.
The findings showed a significant reduction in eye itching for those using the antihistamine drop compared to those using the placebo. This reduction was noticed at all time points, and was found to last for at least 8 hours. Additionally, a decrease in redness and other secondary signs of inflammation was noted. Any side effects that participants experienced were generally mild and short-lived.

CONCLUSION.
In conclusion, the antihistamine eye drop, BBOS 1.5%, was found to be efficient in promptly reducing allergy symptoms in the eye, such as itching and redness, for at least 8 hours after application. Other signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced.
