AIM.
This study aimed to find out if the kind of health warning on an alcoholic drink's bottle can affect how quickly people drink it. Previous studies found that scary health warnings make people realize the risks of drinking more clearly, and lead them to want to drink less. Another study showed that the faster you drink, the more drunk you get. We combined these two ideas to see if the type of health warning can make people drink slower.

SUBJECT AND METHODS.
We tested this idea on 45 women. We gave them an alcoholic drink in a relaxed setting. There were three different groups: one group had drinks with no health warning, one had drinks with only a text warning, and one had drinks with a warning that included a picture and text.

RESULTS.
We found that women drank slower when their drinks had a health warning, regardless of whether it was just text or included a picture. Interestingly, the speed was the same in both health warning groups. However, whether the drink had a warning or not did not affect whether they liked the drink.

CONCLUSION.
This is the first study to show that strong health warnings on alcoholic drinks can make people drink slower. It also suggests that these warnings can be used without making the drink less appealing to consumers.
