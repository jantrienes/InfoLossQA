GOAL:
We wanted to see whether exercises in water or on land would be better at reducing hip and lower back pain, and improving overall fitness in patients with sickle cell disease, an illness that affects the red blood cells.

HOW WE DID IT:
All volunteers agreed to be a part of the study and took several physical tests. We examined things like pain levels, flexibility, strength, and muscle activity. We divided ten patients into two groups: one did water exercises and the other did normal gym exercises. Both groups had two sessions a week for twelve weeks.

WHAT WE FOUND:
After the twelve weeks, both groups saw improvements in pain levels, flexibility, and strength. However, there was no notable difference in improvement between the two groups. 

CONCLUSION:
Physical exercise, whether it's done in water or on land, can help to treat muscle problems in patients with sickle cell disease. It did seem like the water exercises were slightly better for improving muscle strength, but we would need to study more people over a longer time to know for sure.
