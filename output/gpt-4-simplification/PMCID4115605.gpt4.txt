GOAL
The aim was to find out if a drug called droxidopa can help improve a condition where a person's blood pressure drops when they stand up (nOH), specifically in people with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

METHODS
Patients with the above conditions were given droxidopa in doses that were adjusted according to their response. This was followed by a 7-day break, after which they were given either droxidopa or a placebo for 7 days. Their progress was tracked using a special questionnaire that measures the severity of their symptoms and how it affects their daily activities.

RESULTS
The results showed that the patients given droxidopa had a better improvement in their symptoms compared to those given a placebo. They especially felt better about dizziness and standing for long periods. Their standing blood pressure also increased more than those on the placebo. Side effects were rare and included minor headache and dizziness. No patients stopped the treatment because of side effects.

CONCLUSIONS
Droxidopa appears to help improve symptoms in patients whose blood pressure drops when they stand up. It seems to improve their daily life functioning and increases their standing blood pressure. Generally, the drug is well tolerated.

EVIDENCE LEVEL
This study offers strong evidence that droxidopa helps improve symptoms in patients whose blood pressure drops when they stand up over a 7-day period.
