BACKGROUND:
Researchers have been increasingly exploring the use of ketamine - a drug known to relieve pain - for reducing post-surgery discomfort.

OBJECTIVES:
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of injecting ketamine directly into the bloodstream, in addition to combined use with another painkiller called bupivacaine, in subsiding pain after a specific kidney stone removal surgery (tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy).

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
100 patients slated for kidney stone removal were randomly categorized into five groups. Each group received different treatment procedures - some received saline solutions, some received bupivacaine, while others were given varying doses of ketamine or a mix of ketamine and bupivacaine. The main goal was to compare the different groups' pain levels after surgery. Other factors such as the level of consciousness, the use of extra painkillers, timing of additional painkiller use, and their overall vital signs were also inspected.

RESULTS:
Patients that received a combination of bupivacaine and ketamine (both in lower and higher doses) reported lower pain levels within the first half-hour following surgery, and consumed fewer additional painkillers during the first day after surgery, compared to other groups. After surgery, these patients also were granted a longer time before needing extra painkillers.

CONCLUSIONS:
Applying a mix of ketamine and bupivacaine proved better at relieving pain after kidney stone removal compared to other methods.
