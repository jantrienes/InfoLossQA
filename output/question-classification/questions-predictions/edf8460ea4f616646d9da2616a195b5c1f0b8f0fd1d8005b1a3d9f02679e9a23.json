The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What kind of serious side effects were researchers worried about?\n2. Compared to the low dose group, who saw increased levels of IL-17, how did levels of IL-17 change on the high dose group?\n3. Besides relapses and quality of life, what else was noted about the patients?\n4. Were both eyes of each patient tested?\n5. How much of either drug was given to the respective group?\n6. How are the drugs administered?\n7. How did researchers measure how much blood vessels had shrunk?\n8. What was the gender ratio among the participants?\n9. How did the patients develop abnormal blood vessels in their cornea?\n10. How is this result reliable?\n11. How much did the blood vessels reduce after the bevacizumab injection?\n12. How much did the abnormal vessels reduce a week after the ranibizumab injection?\n13. How much did the abnormal blood vessels reduce in group 1 compared to group 2?\n14. What factors does this study investigate in the growth and development of immature cow egg cells?\n15. How were the cow egg cells separated into four groups?\n16. What was the special freezing mixture used for group 2?\n17. What was the second mix used in group 3?\n18. How were the cow egg cells in group 4 warmed up?\n19. How did the growth and development rates of group 4 compare to the other three groups in both experiments?\n20. How reliable are these results?\n21. What kind of brain injuries cause these symptoms?\n22. How does environment enrichment help boost brain recovery?\n23. Where in the brain is this study focused on?\n24. What breed of rat was used in the study?\n25. How were the rats assigned to receive either a minor brain injury or a fake surgery?\n26. How was the mild brain injury induced in the rats?\n27. How were the rats placed in their living conditions?\n28. What are normal living conditions for the rats?\n29. How were their cognitive abilities tested?\n30. Why would a real-time functional MRI neurofeedback be a preferred treatment?\n31. What was the other brain area that is being compared in the study?\n32. How many participants were in either the left amygdala group or the comparison group?"}]}
