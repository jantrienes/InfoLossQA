The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1.

How were the patients divided into the two groups?\n8. What kind of balanced or unbalanced fluids were administered to patients?\n9. When were measurements taken?\n10. What kind of measurements were taken for this study?\n11. How were participants split up into the two groups?\n12. What kind of hip surgery did the participants receive?\n13. How much of the spinal anesthesia and the anesthetic drug did the participants receive?\n14. How was pain measured for this study?\n15. How were the measurements compared?\n16. How did the group that received the drug beside the spinal column compare to the group that received the drug in the space around the spinal column in average levels of pain?\n17. How reliable are these results?\n18. How did the study control for bias?\n19. Is there a possible reason why the group who received 5 shots of the highest dose of the nicotine vaccine were more likely to quit smoking than the placebo group?\n20. What kind of surgery was going to be performed on the participants?\n21. How were the participants divided into the two groups?\n22. How much of each solution was given to the participants?\n23. What times did researchers notice a significant difference in blood pressure and average arterial pressure compared to when they saw no significant difference?\n24. How long were patients observed after being given the IV of salt solution?\n25. Aside from the difference in measurements at specific time points, what else was observed in this study?\n26. Aside from avoiding a drop in blood pressure and faster heart rates, what else can a strong salt solution help with before patients are given anesthesia?\n27. How does this study plan to change the function of DLPFC?\n28. Who does this study aim to assess the working memory of after stimulating the DLPFC?\n29. How were the participants divided into the two groups?\n30. What type of study was done to assess the effect of stimulating the DLPFC?\n31. How did researchers stimulate the DLPFC?\n32. What type of task was given to participants to test their working memory?"}]}
