The question type reflects the nature of the question. It is NOT determined by the interrogative word of the question. There are 10 question types in total. The definition for each type is shown below. Please select the question type which is most likely for a given question. Only output the category title, not the description.\n\n## Question Types\n1. VERIFICATION: Asking for the truthfulness of an event or a concept.\n- Was the study double-blinded?\n- Was there a trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for subjects with high baseline values?\n\n2. DISJUNCTION: Asking for the true one given multiple events or concepts, where comparison among options is not needed.\n- no example available, match by the description\n\n3. CONCEPT: Asking for a definition of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of result is being measured in this study?\n- What were the main inclusion criteria for this study?\n- What does the WCJ-III test specifically measure?\n- Which areas of the brain were analyzed?\n\n4. EXTENT: Asking for the extent or quantity of an event or a concept.\n- How reliable are these results?\n- How long were the participants observed?\n- How much ibuprofen was in the small dose?\n- How many young and old people participated in the study?\n\n5. EXAMPLE: Asking for example(s) or instance(s) of an event or a concept.\n- What kind of conditions cause corneal neovascularization?\n\n6. COMPARISON: Asking for comparison among multiple events or concepts.\n- On what results did the control group do better than the intervention group?\n- How did headache of participants receiving ibuprofen compare to those participants that received a placebo?\n- How more effective was the arm cranking exercise with and without electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n7. CAUSE: Asking for the cause or reason for an event or a concept.\n- What motivates this study?\n- Why is EMS being investigated?\n\n8. CONSEQUENCE: Asking for the consequences or results of an event.\n- What was the effect of using ibuprofen to treat headaches?\n- What were the main findings of the study?\n- What does this study tell us about arm cranking with electrical muscle stimulation?\n\n9. PROCEDURAL: Asking for the procedures, tools, or methods by which a certain outcome is achieved.\n- What questionnaire was used for this study?\n- What kind of lab tests were done?\n- How were the patients assigned to a group?\n- How were the different drugs administered to participants?\n\n10. JUDGMENTAL: Asking for the opinions of the answerer's own.\n- no example available, match by the description"}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Instances to classify\n1. What was the mixture ratio or oxygen and nitrous oxide?\n2. What other complications were noted after the tube was inserted?\n3. What was the range of the BIS levels observed in the results?\n4. What type of formoterol is being observed in the study?\n5. How was the study conducted?\n6. What other characteristics did the patients in the study have?\n7. How much formoterol did patients take? \n8. What type of inhaler did patients use to take the medication in the study?\n9. How much Salbutamol was permitted and how was it administered?\n10. How many of the patients were from Japan versus Europe, male, and part of the group that took either 4.5 micrograms of formoterol versus 9 micrograms?\n11. How much more noticeable were the results in the groups taking formoterol than the placebo?\n12. What were the numerical results behind the group's improvements throughout the study?\n13. Was there a difference between the two groups taking formoterol in the reduction of taking reliever medication?\n14. What type of trainees were present in the teaching hospital?\n15. How was the study conducted?\n16. Who did the tests for the research?\n17. Who measured the average length of the bone marrow and how?\n18. How long were the bone marrows pulled out by the standard group versus the OBM group?\n19. What were the recorded times for the two groups?\n20. How is the study being conducted? \n21. How many patients were receiving the colloid or crystalloid?  \n22. How much fluid was administered based on fasting?\n23. What symptoms were observed?\n24. How is the energy supply managed?\n25. What else does increased blood flow do?\n26. What design did the study use?\n27. What is the standard versus the thinner needle size?\n28. What procedure did the study use?\n29. 45 is an odd number. How many patients were given the small dose vs the large dose?\n30. How much vitamin D3 were in the small and large dose?\n31. What 'certain things' were checked in the blood?\n32. What hormone did the group with the high dose of Vitamin D3 see lower levels of?"}]}
