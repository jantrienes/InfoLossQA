By blocking TNF-alpha, etanercept helps to reduce inflammation and preserve beta cell function, which can help to improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of complications associated with type 1 diabetes.","input_idx":[[73,91]],"output_idx":[[58,68]],"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2703617,"edit_id":"1255d25de9fdf6f21122ac03890766da","category":"omission","question":"What were the specific objectives of the study?","answer":"The study aimed to assess the impact of a fast track area on waiting times, length of stay, LWBS rates, and mortality rates in non-urgent patients.","input_idx":[[229,468]],"output_idx":null,"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2703617,"edit_id":"c15f410071dc132eb66029c50dee4384","category":"omission","question":"Where did the study take place?","answer":"The study was conducted at a 500-bed, urban, tertiary care hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.","input_idx":[[582,682]],"output_idx":null,"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2703617,"edit_id":"d0eb9dfaea7225e145259690eb597631","category":"concept","question":"What is the purpose of the fast track area?","answer":"The purpose of the fast track area is to reduce waiting times, patient dissatisfaction, and morbidity by providing a separate area for less urgent cases, allowing for faster treatment and better patient flow.","input_idx":[[116,227]],"output_idx":[[156,212]],"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2703617,"edit_id":"3dfd3355cddebd29fa06d09431f218c8","category":"concept","question":"When was the FTA introduced, and what was the timeframe of the study?","answer":"The FTA was introduced in January 2006, and the study compared data from January 2005 (pre-intervention) to January 2006 (post-intervention).","input_idx":null,"output_idx":[[570,681]],"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":["invalid_input_localization"]},{"PMCID":2703617,"edit_id":"61d100f4d8eac29f28c5e960df0f3570","category":"omission","question":"What were the specific waiting time reductions for less urgent patients?","answer":"The study found that less urgent patients waited 22 minutes less, on average, after the FTA was introduced, while the very least urgent patients waited 28 minutes less.","input_idx":null,"output_idx":null,"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":["invalid_input_localization"]},{"PMCID":2703617,"edit_id":"041cea0fd9c49b55c780ef037cfd2ff1","category":"omission","question":"What was the specific reduction in the LWBS rate?","answer":"The study found that the LWBS rate was reduced from 4.7% to 0.7%, a significant reduction of 85%.","input_idx":[[1225,1302]],"output_idx":null,"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2703617,"edit_id":"d81e21f3b7b57e907436508ef3c450ac","category":"omission","question":"Did the FTA have an impact on mortality rates?","answer":"The study found that opening a fast track area had no significant impact on mortality rates.","input_idx":[[1303,1373]],"output_idx":null,"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2710065,"edit_id":"723802e7dd9dcfeb1e428d9bafc0f70f","category":"omission","question":"What was the aim of the study?","answer":"The aim of the study was to compare giving a single dose of antibiotics through an IV versus not giving any antibiotics before minor bladder procedures, such as a biopsy or small tumor removal.","input_idx":[[12,247]],"output_idx":null,"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2710065,"edit_id":"1e60e621665765ff15a49ee0c3f8bb4c","category":"concept","question":"What was the age range of the patients involved in the study?","answer":"The patients involved in the study ranged in age from 19 to 84 years old.","input_idx":[[272,407]],"output_idx":[[222,288]],"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":[]},{"PMCID":2710065,"edit_id":"bce18e967e9294474a5cfc2f4f52ca17","category":"omission","question":"What measure of disease activity was used in the study?","answer":"The researchers used the Partial Mayo Score to track the disease activity of the patients.","input_idx":null,"output_idx":null,"annotator":"llama2-70b","prediction_errors":["invalid_input_localization"]},{"PMCID":2710065,"edit_id":"11eda60e7caedacf8c03be383046d7d2","category":"concept","question":"What additional procedures were performed in 15% of the patients?","answer":"The additional procedures performed in 15% of the patients included punch biopsy or TUR of a small bladder tumor.
