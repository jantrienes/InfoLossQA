This goal could be achieved simply by minimizing the variation in arterial pulse pressure (\u0394PP) induced by mechanical ventilation. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized, single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the length of postoperative stay in hospital.\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-three patients undergoing high-risk surgery were randomized either to a control group (group C, n = 16) or to an intervention group (group I, n = 17). In group I, \u0394PP was continuously monitored during surgery by a multiparameter bedside monitor and minimized to 10% or less by volume loading.\n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in terms of demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiology score, type, and duration of surgery. During surgery, group I received more fluid than group C (4,618 \u00b1 1,557 versus 1,694 \u00b1 705 ml (mean \u00b1 SD), P < 0.0001), and \u0394PP decreased from 22 \u00b1 75 to 9 \u00b1 1% (P < 0.05) in group I. The median duration of postoperative stay in hospital (7 versus 17 days, P < 0.01) was lower in group I than in group C.

One way to achieve this is by using a ventilator to regulate the pressure changes in the blood vessels during these operations. Our research aimed to find out if this method could shorten the length of a patient's stay in the hospital after surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a study that involved 33 patients who were due for major surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group, made up of 16 patients, was treated normally and served as our basis for comparison. In the second group of 17 patients, we kept track of their blood pressure changes using a special monitor during surgery, and ensured that these changes remained small by giving them a lot of fluids.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe two patient groups were similar in their demographic data, overall health condition, type of surgery, and surgery duration. Throughout the surgery, we noticed that the second group received more fluid and experienced a decline in their blood pressure changes. Also, this group generally spent less time in the hospital after surgery (7 days instead of 17). They also had fewer complications, spent less time on ventilators (1 day instead of 5), and stayed in the ICU for a shorter period (3 days instead of 9). \n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings suggest that if we carefully monitor and control blood pressure changes by giving plenty of fluids during major surgery, it can improve the recovery outcomes.

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P < .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P < .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P < .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P < .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P < .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P < .001). Dairy was the primary calcium source for both groups (55% of intake for black women and 57% of intake for white women).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CFFFQ can be used to identify postmenopausal women with inadequate calcium intakes (<800 mg/d) and to identify key sources of dietary calcium. Older black women consume less daily calcium than do older white women.", "target": "INTRODUCTION:\nMore and more foods are being boosted with extra calcium. Because of this, it might be hard for traditional methods that measure how much calcium a person gets from their food to accurately work out how much they're really getting, especially if these methods are using off-the-shelf software. We wanted to create and test a special questionnaire that focused on calcium intake, which would also take into account foods naturally full of calcium and those that have extra calcium added to them. We also wanted to take a closer look at where black and white women going through menopause, in particular, get their calcium from and whether or not they're getting enough.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years. They were asked to recall everything they've eaten in the last 24 hours and then answer our 46-item special calcium questionnaire. \n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that the daily calcium intake measured by our questionnaire strongly matched with the 24-hour food recall. Interestingly, our questionnaire showed a higher total daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall. As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall underestimated the amount of calcium intake compared to our questionnaire. Our results also showed that dairy was the main source of calcium for both black and white women. Though our questionnaire estimated a higher amount of calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall, it was more accurate in identifying low calcium intakes.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur special questionnaire can be used to find out if women going through menopause are not getting enough calcium in their diet (less than 800 milligrams per day). Additionally, it can shed light on the main sources of dietary calcium. We also found that older black women tend to consume less daily calcium than older white women.", "question": "Who were the participants in the study?", "answer": "The participants in the study were a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women, whose ages averaged around 69.4 years.", "id": 446, "source_label": [{"start": 587, "end": 699, "text": "We studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years).", "labels": ["concept"]}], "target_label": [{"start": 693, "end": 812, "text": "We worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years.", "labels": ["concept"]}], "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "givenness_location": "givenness_location_1", "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_4", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_2", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "simplicity_jargon_rationale": "The answer doesn't explain what a \"convenience sample\" or \"postmenopausal\" means.

We thus investigated if meal-induced platelet activation could be attenuated by meal insulin. A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was performed to compare postprandial platelet activation after premeal injections of placebo or insulin aspart (0.1 and 0.2 units/kg) in 18 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry, without and with stimulation by the thromboxane analog U46619 or ADP. Measurements were before and after premeal blood glucose standardization (to 6\u20137 mmol/L by insulin infusion, if needed) and at 90 min after the meal. Premeal insulin reduced postprandial hyperglycemia by 2\u20133 mmol/L compared with placebo. Postmeal insulin levels were doubled with placebo and further elevated with insulin injections. The standardized meal enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression by 23% after placebo; this response was more than doubled after premeal insulin. U46619-induced fibrinogen binding was unchanged after meal intake with placebo but was markedly enhanced (by \u223c50\u201360%) after premeal insulin.

After meals, blood glucose levels can become unusually high, which can lead to platelet activation. \n\nThis study sought to understand whether administering insulin before a meal could reduce or prevent this platelet activation effect. The experiment included 18 patients with type 2 diabetes and used a reliable trial method where the order of insulin and placebo treatments were randomly assigned and then swapped. \n\nThe process used a technology called flow cytometry to measure platelet activation, which was evaluated before and after the pre-meal blood glucose standardization (if needed, insulin was infused to bring blood glucose levels to a standard range) and 90 minutes after eating. \n\nThe study discovered that giving insulin before a meal reduced post-meal high blood sugar levels significantly compared to the placebo.

The trial protocols on which they were treated were analysed to identify the treatment costs for the experimental arm(s) of the trial and the equivalent SOC had the patient not been entered in the trial. The treatment cost difference was calculated by subtracting the experimental treatment cost from SOC cost. For randomised trials, an average treatment cost was estimated by taking into account the number of arms and randomisation ratio. An estimate of the annual treatment costs was calculated.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 357 adult oncology patients were treated on 53 different trial protocols: 40 phase III, 2 randomised II/III and 11 phase II design. A total of 27 trials were academic, non-commercial sponsored trials and 26 were commercial sponsored trials. When compared with SOC, the average treatment cost per patient was an excess of \u00a3431 for a non-commercial trial (range \u00a36393 excess to \u00a36005 saving) and a saving of \u00a39294 for a commercial trial (range \u00a30 to \u00a371 480). There was an overall treatment cost saving of \u00a3388 719 in 2009 and \u00a3496 556 in 2010, largely attributable to pharmaceutical company provision of free drug supplies.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOn an average, non-commercial trial protocols were associated with a small per patient excess treatment cost, whereas commercial trials were associated with a substantially higher cost saving.

Because of the lack of success of most TBI interventions and the documented benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our study on use of EE in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis.

Analgesic modalities, if properly applied, can prevent or at least minimize this needless suffering and these complications.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetic drugs by paravertebral and epidural routes in controlling postoperative pain in patients undergoing hip surgeries.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe study involved 60 patients who were undergoing hip surgery under the subarachnoid block. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 patients. Group I (paravertebral group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 2.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 mL/h in the paravertebral space. Group II (epidural group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 mL/hr in the epidural space for 48 hours in the postoperative period.

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52\u201385 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale\u2013Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI \u22656) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus \u22123 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (\u22123.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdd-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.", "target": "PURPOSE:\nIt has been suggested that a lack of good quality sleep might be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleep, are often low in people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, we wanted to know if adding melatonin to their medication would help. We also wondered if these effects were related to whether or not these patients also had sleep disorders.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nWe tested the effects of adding prolonged-release melatonin (a slow-release form of the hormone) in 80 patients, roughly half men and half women, with an average age of 75 years. These patients had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and were already receiving standard treatment. Some of these patients also had insomnia. For the first two weeks, we tested these patients with a placebo, then for the next 24 weeks, we gave half of them 2 mg of melatonin each night and the other half the placebo. Following this, we gave all patients the placebo for 2 more weeks. We measured how well these patients were thinking, their sleep quality, daily activities, and how safe this treatment was.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe patients who received melatonin for 24 weeks generally thought better and slept more efficiently than those who received the placebo.

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52\u201385 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale\u2013Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI \u22656) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus \u22123 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (\u22123.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdd-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.", "target": "PURPOSE:\nIt has been suggested that a lack of good quality sleep might be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleep, are often low in people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, we wanted to know if adding melatonin to their medication would help. We also wondered if these effects were related to whether or not these patients also had sleep disorders.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nWe tested the effects of adding prolonged-release melatonin (a slow-release form of the hormone) in 80 patients, roughly half men and half women, with an average age of 75 years. These patients had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and were already receiving standard treatment. Some of these patients also had insomnia. For the first two weeks, we tested these patients with a placebo, then for the next 24 weeks, we gave half of them 2 mg of melatonin each night and the other half the placebo. Following this, we gave all patients the placebo for 2 more weeks. We measured how well these patients were thinking, their sleep quality, daily activities, and how safe this treatment was.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe patients who received melatonin for 24 weeks generally thought better and slept more efficiently than those who received the placebo. The patients with insomnia who received melatonin saw a significant improvement in how well they could think and how well they slept.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that one of the most important areas corresponding to the working memory is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC). This study was aimed to assess whether bilateral modulation of the DLPFC using a noninvasive brain stimulation, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), modifies the working memory function in healthy adults.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a randomized sham-controlled cross-over study, 60 subjects (30 Males) received sham and active tDCS in two subgroups (anode left/cathode right and anode right/cathode left) of the DLPFC. Subjects were presented working memory n-back task while the reaction time and accuracy were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nA repeated measures, mixed design ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the type of stimulation (sham vs. active) in anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC [F(1,55)= 5.29, P=0.019], but not the inverse polarity worsened accuracy in the 2-back working memory task. There were also no statistically significant changes in speed of working memory [F(1,55)= 0.458,P=0.502] related to type or order of stimulation.\n\nDISCUSSION.\nThe results would imply to a polarity dependence of bilateral tDCS of working memory. Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair working memory, while the reverser stimulation had no effect. Meaning that bilateral stimulation of DLFC would not be a useful procedure to improve working memory. Further studies are required to understand subtle effects of different tDCS stimulation/inhibition electrode positioning on the working memory.", "target": "INTRODUCTION.\nWorking memory is essential for how we learn, remember, and interact with the world. One area of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), is particularly important for working memory. Our goal in this study was to see if we could change how the DLPFC works to improve memory using a safe, non-invasive method called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had 60 people (half men, half women) take part in our study. We split them into two groups and used tDCS to stimulate different sides of their DLPFC. All participants were given tasks to test their working memory while we measured their speed and accuracy.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur analysis indicated that the type of stimulation mattered. When we stimulated the left side of the DLPFC and reduced activity on the right side, it clearly messed with participants' memory accuracy. However, doing the opposite didn't have any noticeable effect.

A total of 172 patients were randomized into two groups according to the following medications administered prior to upper endoscopy: oral phloroglucin (group A, n=86), and cimetropium bromide (group B, n=86).

We studied various body responses and inflammation markers in three groups of people, totaling 142 subjects in all. Group A consisted of 59 people who drink alcohol regularly and have the H. pylori infection. Group B had 53 subjects who drink alcohol regularly but do not have the infection. Finally, Group C was the control group of 30 people who neither drink alcohol regularly nor are infected.\n\nBody mass index (BMI), a measure of body size based on height and weight, was generally higher in those who drank alcohol frequently whether infected with H. pylori or not. However, the difference in BMI wasn't significant between those who were infected and those who weren't.\n\nGenerally, certain substances that signify inflammation were different between the groups. For example, lower levels of two inflammation markers, IL-10 and E-selectin, were found in those who drank alcohol and were infected with H. pylori compared to those that weren't infected. Those who drank alcohol but weren't infected showed higher levels of these markers than the control group.\n\nHowever, the levels of another inflammation marker, TNF-\u03b1, were not very different among the groups. Levels of substances that signify cell damage were also not significantly different among the groups.\n\nTo sum it all up, we think that the H. pylori infection might weaken certain inflammation responses in those who drink alcohol regularly.

The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 d\u22121) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children <24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (\u22120.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (\u22120.20 to 0.63) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIt is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group.

This was done on the second day after they had surgery to fix heart defects they were born with. We did a special test to measure how much of a kind of protein called \"valine\" their bodies were making. We also measured how much of another protein called \"albumin\" their bodies were making.

Nevertheless, breastfeeding rates remain low despite public health efforts. Our study aims to investigate the effect of controlled limited formula usage during birth hospitalisation on breastfeeding, using the primary hypothesis that early limited formula feeds in infants with early weight loss will not adversely affect the rate of exclusive or any breastfeeding as measured at discharge, 3 and 6 months of age.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nWe randomly assigned 104 healthy term infants, 24 to 48 hours old, with \u2265 5% loss of birth weight to controlled limited formula (CLF) intervention (10 ml formula by syringe after each breastfeeding, discontinued at onset of lactation) or control group (standard approach, SA). Groups were compared for demographic data and breastfeeding rates at discharge, 3 months and 6 months of age (p-values adjusted for multiple testing).\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty newborns were analysed in CLF and 50 in SA group. There were no differences in demographic data or clinical characteristics between groups. We found no evidence of difference between treatment groups in the rates of exclusive as well as any breastfeeding at discharge (p-value 0.2 and >0.99 respectively), 3 months (p-value 0.12 and 0.10) and 6 months of infants\u2019 age (p-value 0.45 and 0.34 respectively). The percentage weight loss during hospitalisation was significantly higher in the SA group (7.3% in CLF group, 8.4% in SA group, p = 0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study shows that controlled limited formula use does not have an adverse effect on rates of breastfeeding in the short and long term.

We wanted to see if giving newborns a small amount of baby formula right after birth would hurt or help breastfeeding rates. We also wanted to know whether this approach would hinder breastfeeding when the baby is three or six months old.\n\nHOW THE STUDY WAS DONE.\nWe picked 104 healthy babies that had lost more than 5% of their birth weight and were between one and two days old. We split them into two groups. In one group, we gave the babies 10 ml of baby formula feed after each breastfeeding session (this was stopped as soon as the mother's milk came in). The other group followed the standard approach. We tracked breastfeeding rates when the babies left the hospital, and then checked in when they were three and six months old.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nIn both groups, 50 newborns were examined. The groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical characteristics.

A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of \u03b2 activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0\u00b10.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.\n\nRESULTS.\nUPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states.", "target": "INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.\nThis research is about a deep brain stimulation method, known as adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), where we use feedback from the brain to guide the process.

Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.\n\nRESULTS. \nThe treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nSo, we conclude that using aDBS on both sides of the brain improves certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

We gave half the patients the drug combination and the other half a harmless salt solution (as a comparison group). The levosimendan was started 4 hours before surgery and stopped before the start of the heart bypass; during the last part of surgery, levosimendan was restarted along with SNP. If a patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during this process, a volume increasing solution was given to correct it. We recorded many patients' blood measurements, their need for heart-strengthening drugs, and laboratory test results.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nAfter surgery, 5 patients died due to heart complications (one from the drug group and four from the comparison group). Patients given the drugs had stronger heart function stats compared to those who weren't. These patients also needed less supportive drugs and less interventional equipment post-surgery. Various measurements like cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac index were better in the drug group. Also, fewer people in the drug group needed help from heart-strengthening drugs or equipment post-surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe study shows that the LS and SNP combination really improved heart function during and after surgery.

While the benefits of paravertebral block (PVB) on pain after thoracotomy and mastectomy have been demonstrated, not enough investigations on the effects of PVB on pain after open cholecystectomy have been conducted. We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic PVB reduces pain scores, decreases opioid consumption, and prolongs analgesic request time after cholecystectomy.\n\nMETHODS.\nOf 52 patients recruited, 50 completed the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: the paravertebral group and the control group. The outcome measures were the severity of pain measured on numeric pain rating scale, total opioid consumption, and first analgesic request time during the first postoperative 24 hours.\n\nRESULT.\nThe main outcomes recorded during 24 hours after surgery were Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (NRS, 0\u201310), cumulative opioid consumption, and the first analgesic request time. Twenty four hours after surgery, NRS at rest was 4 (3\u20136) vs 5 (5\u20137) and at movement 4 (4\u20137) vs 6 (5\u20137.5) for the PVB and control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole observation period was statistically significant (P<0.05). Twenty-four hours after surgery, median (25th\u201375th percentile) cumulative morphine consumption was 0 (0\u20132) vs 2.5 (2\u20134) mg (P<0.0001) and cumulative tramadol consumption was 200 (150\u2013250) mg vs 300 (200\u2013350) mg in the paravertebral and in the control group, respectively (P=0.003).

So, there's been a lot of focus on how to manage this pain. One method is known as a paravertebral block (PVB), which has been shown to help with pain from other types of surgeries, like thoracotomy and mastectomy. But we don't know as much about how PVB can reduce pain after gallbladder removal. Our goal here was to see if a one-time PVB injection could lessen the intensity of pain, reduce the need for strong pain medications (opioids), and extend the time before a patient needed more pain relief.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied 50 people who had their gallbladders removed in an open surgery. They were split into two groups: one group received the PVB, the other did not (they were our control group). We then looked at how bad their pain was, how much opioid medication they needed, and how long it took before they asked for more pain relief in the first 24 hours following surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found some promising results! The PVB group reported less pain 24 hours after their surgery than the control group did. They took less opioid medication and waited longer before asking for more pain relief. These differences were significant, meaning it wasn't just due to chance.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\nIn conclusion, using a single dose of PVB as part of a pain management strategy seems to provide better pain relief after gallbladder surgery compared to not using it.

Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (p < 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p < 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87).

We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.", "target": "GOAL: \nWe wanted to see whether following a heart-related event, at-home fitness programs with virtual support could help more patients stick with their exercise routines and possibly get better results. \n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\nWe tried this with 90 patients who had medium or low risk for future heart issues. We divided them into two groups: one group did their rehab exercises at home with virtual support, and the other group did the same exercises but at a rehab center. \n\nWe found out that both groups stuck to their workouts equally well. However, the people who exercised at home were happier. Also, everyone in both groups got more fit after rehab and kept that up after one year, with no big difference between the two groups. \n\nExercise levels didn't change within one year. Although not statistically significant, it seemed to cost less for the healthcare system if patients exercised at home, by an average of \u20ac437 per patient. When we looked at the bigger picture, we also found that the home-based training might save more money \u2013 around \u20ac3160 per patient. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nOverall, we didn't find a big difference in fitness gains, physical activity levels, or life quality between at-home workouts with virtual help and center-based workouts. But with the folks at home, they liked their workouts more and it cost less overall. So, we believe that for patients with low-to-medium heart disease risk, using at-home workouts with virtual support works just as well as doing workouts at a rehab center.", "question": "What are the challenges associated with cardiac rehabilitation?", "answer": "The challenges associated with cardiac rehabilitation include low participation rates and the fact that the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time.", "id": 506, "source_label": [{"start": 5, "end": 242, "text": "Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time.", "labels": ["omission"]}], "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "givenness_location": "givenness_location_na", "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_3", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_2", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "givenness_phrasing_rationale": "The question asks about cardiac rehabilitation which is never explicitly mentioned in the simple text, which only talks about rehab after a heart-related event.

However, the time for both procedures to complete wasn't significantly different.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth treatments were found to be effective and safe for treating chronic tonsillitis-associated bad breath. However, the laser showed better results as it caused less pain, less bleeding, and allowed patients to return to their normal diet sooner.", "question": "When were the severity of symptoms evaluated after the procedure?", "answer": "The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was evaluated 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure.", "id": 517, "source_label": [{"start": 630, "end": 765, "text": "The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure.", "labels": ["omission"]}], "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "givenness_location": "givenness_location_3", "target_label_missing": [{"start": 570, "end": 670, "text": "We monitored how severe the symptoms were after a week, a month, and then six months after treatment", "labels": ["concept (missing)"]}], "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_3", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_1", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "simplicity_jargon_rationale": "The answer includes halitosis and \"foreign body sensation\", which is mentioned as bad breath and feelings from the throat in the simplified text (however, is not referred to specifically as halitosis or \"foreign body sensation\" in the simple text).", "relevance_source_rationale": "The original text also talks about measuring pain levels, but it classifies this as safety outcome measures not symptoms.", "relevance_target_rationale": "The simple text gives almost the exact explanation as the original text, it only excludes restating exactly what the symptoms are in the sentence.
