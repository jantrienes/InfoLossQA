Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg, every 4\u20138 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1\u20132 weeks.\n\nPATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.\nPatients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, \u2265 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nNinety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77\u00b77%). Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae than with lanreotide microparticles (3\u00b78 (0\u00b75) vs 4\u00b73 (0\u00b75) ng/ml; P < 0\u00b7001). GH levels < 2\u00b75 ng/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH < 2\u00b75 ng/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and treatment was well accepted.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4\u20138 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7\u201314 days.", "target": "GOAL AND PLAN\nThe goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.\nWe asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogel\u00ae every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nNinety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the Autogel\u00ae than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the Autogel\u00ae and patients were happy with the treatment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks works just as well and is as well tolerated as using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every one to two weeks in treating acromegaly.", "question": "How long had the patients been using lanreotide microparticles before joining the study?", "answer": "The patients had been using lanreotide microparticles for at least 2 months before joining the study.", "id": 5158, "source_label": [{"start": 426, "end": 478, "text": "lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, \u2265 2 months prestudy", "labels": ["omission"]}], "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "target_label_missing": [{"start": 389, "end": 490, "text": "We asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past", "labels": ["concept (missing)"]}], "givenness_location": "givenness_location_3", "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_4", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_3", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "hallucinations_answer": "hallucinations_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "givenness_location_rationale": "using lanreotide microparticles in the past is mentioned", "simplicity_jargon_rationale": "lanreotide microparticles are not fully explained", "relevance_target_rationale": "the simple text does not mention that lanreotide microparticles were used for at least 2 months; no specific time is mentioned", "annotator": 4, "annotation_id": 3710, "created_at": "2024-01-02T19:06:35.912474Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-02T19:06:35.912504Z", "lead_time": 340.796}, {"doc_id": 1774569, "edit_id": "bb3ff67d615e597a85a5ca282533dbcc", "source": "BACKGROUND.\nMany drug users present to primary care requesting detoxification from illicit opiates.

Comparing the effectiveness and safety of these treatments will help make decisions about which medication to recommend for treating malaria.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested these three combinations on 534 children who were otherwise healthy. The children were divided into three groups, each receiving one of the drug combinations. They were watched closely by our project staff who delivered the medicines. We checked on them several times after the treatment - 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days later. We were looking for whether the medication failed to get rid of the malaria, and if any child had negative side effects from the medication.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS.\nWhen comparing the results, less children in the AS+AQ group had failed treatments and signs of malaria compared to the other two groups. However, many children in all three groups threw up after taking the medication. It should be noted that the AS+AQ group's treatment failure rate was lower, though not significantly. It also helps to know, the overall rate of side effects was similar in all groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBased on our findings, AS+AQ seems to be a suitable first choice for treating uncomplicated malaria in Ghana or in West African countries.

The primary endpoint was the length of postoperative stay in hospital.\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-three patients undergoing high-risk surgery were randomized either to a control group (group C, n = 16) or to an intervention group (group I, n = 17). In group I, \u0394PP was continuously monitored during surgery by a multiparameter bedside monitor and minimized to 10% or less by volume loading.\n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in terms of demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiology score, type, and duration of surgery. During surgery, group I received more fluid than group C (4,618 \u00b1 1,557 versus 1,694 \u00b1 705 ml (mean \u00b1 SD), P < 0.0001), and \u0394PP decreased from 22 \u00b1 75 to 9 \u00b1 1% (P < 0.05) in group I. The median duration of postoperative stay in hospital (7 versus 17 days, P < 0.01) was lower in group I than in group C. The number of postoperative complications per patient (1.4 \u00b1 2.1 versus 3.9 \u00b1 2.8, P < 0.05), as well as the median duration of mechanical ventilation (1 versus 5 days, P < 0.05) and stay in the intensive care unit (3 versus 9 days, P < 0.01) was also lower in group I.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nMonitoring and minimizing \u0394PP by volume loading during high-risk surgery improves postoperative outcome and decreases the length of stay in hospital.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT00479011", "target": "INTRODUCTION.\nResearch has shown that maintaining a healthy blood flow during major surgeries can help to improve recovery after the operation. One way to achieve this is by using a ventilator to regulate the pressure changes in the blood vessels during these operations. Our research aimed to find out if this method could shorten the length of a patient's stay in the hospital after surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a study that involved 33 patients who were due for major surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group, made up of 16 patients, was treated normally and served as our basis for comparison. In the second group of 17 patients, we kept track of their blood pressure changes using a special monitor during surgery, and ensured that these changes remained small by giving them a lot of fluids.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe two patient groups were similar in their demographic data, overall health condition, type of surgery, and surgery duration. Throughout the surgery, we noticed that the second group received more fluid and experienced a decline in their blood pressure changes. Also, this group generally spent less time in the hospital after surgery (7 days instead of 17). They also had fewer complications, spent less time on ventilators (1 day instead of 5), and stayed in the ICU for a shorter period (3 days instead of 9). \n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings suggest that if we carefully monitor and control blood pressure changes by giving plenty of fluids during major surgery, it can improve the recovery outcomes. This includes reducing the number of complications, the length of time on a ventilator, and the duration of the hospital and ICU stay.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT00479011", "question": "What was the specific target for minimizing the blood pressure changes in the intervention group?", "answer": "The specific target was to minimize the blood pressure changes (\u0394PP) to 10% or less.", "id": 5164, "source_label": [{"start": 655, "end": 784, "text": "\u0394PP was continuously monitored during surgery by a multiparameter bedside monitor and minimized to 10% or less by volume loading.", "labels": ["omission"]}], "target_label_missing": [{"start": 740, "end": 813, "text": "ensured that these changes remained small by giving them a lot of fluids.", "labels": ["concept (missing)"]}], "givenness_location": "givenness_location_3", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_3", "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "hallucinations_answer": "hallucinations_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "givenness_location_rationale": "the simple text mentions that the target was to keep blood pressure changes small", "simplicity_standalone_rationale": "\u0394PP is defined as blood pressure changes", "relevance_target_rationale": "the simple text mentions that the target was to keep blood pressure changes small but the specific 10% target is not mentioned", "annotator": 4, "annotation_id": 3716, "created_at": "2024-01-02T19:19:05.293471Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-02T19:19:05.293500Z", "lead_time": 176.456}, {"doc_id": 2699714, "edit_id": "8930c8ad575c706e72eba2def28daeb4", "source": "OBJECTIVE.\nTo gather preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of etanercept therapy to prolong endogenous insulin production in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nThis was a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at the Diabetes Center, Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo.

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P < .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P < .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P < .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P < .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P < .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P < .001). Dairy was the primary calcium source for both groups (55% of intake for black women and 57% of intake for white women).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CFFFQ can be used to identify postmenopausal women with inadequate calcium intakes (<800 mg/d) and to identify key sources of dietary calcium.

Because of this, it might be hard for traditional methods that measure how much calcium a person gets from their food to accurately work out how much they're really getting, especially if these methods are using off-the-shelf software. We wanted to create and test a special questionnaire that focused on calcium intake, which would also take into account foods naturally full of calcium and those that have extra calcium added to them. We also wanted to take a closer look at where black and white women going through menopause, in particular, get their calcium from and whether or not they're getting enough.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years. They were asked to recall everything they've eaten in the last 24 hours and then answer our 46-item special calcium questionnaire. \n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that the daily calcium intake measured by our questionnaire strongly matched with the 24-hour food recall. Interestingly, our questionnaire showed a higher total daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall. As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall underestimated the amount of calcium intake compared to our questionnaire. Our results also showed that dairy was the main source of calcium for both black and white women.

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P < .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P < .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P < .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P < .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P < .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P < .001). Dairy was the primary calcium source for both groups (55% of intake for black women and 57% of intake for white women).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CFFFQ can be used to identify postmenopausal women with inadequate calcium intakes (<800 mg/d) and to identify key sources of dietary calcium. Older black women consume less daily calcium than do older white women.", "target": "INTRODUCTION:\nMore and more foods are being boosted with extra calcium. Because of this, it might be hard for traditional methods that measure how much calcium a person gets from their food to accurately work out how much they're really getting, especially if these methods are using off-the-shelf software. We wanted to create and test a special questionnaire that focused on calcium intake, which would also take into account foods naturally full of calcium and those that have extra calcium added to them. We also wanted to take a closer look at where black and white women going through menopause, in particular, get their calcium from and whether or not they're getting enough.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years. They were asked to recall everything they've eaten in the last 24 hours and then answer our 46-item special calcium questionnaire. \n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that the daily calcium intake measured by our questionnaire strongly matched with the 24-hour food recall. Interestingly, our questionnaire showed a higher total daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall. As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall underestimated the amount of calcium intake compared to our questionnaire. Our results also showed that dairy was the main source of calcium for both black and white women.

To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.\n\nMETHODS.\nWomen with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.\n\nRESULTS.\nOPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN:12609000420246.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nSometimes, doctors need to induce labor in pregnant women, which means they have to artificially start the labor process. This is a common procedure that affects both the woman and the health care system. One way to reduce the impact, is to carry out the procedure in an outpatient setting, meaning the patient can go home after the procedure instead of staying at the hospital. There's not much information on how outpatient and inpatient inductions compare, and also some safety worries if outpatient inductions use a certain medication used in inpatient settings. This study is aiming to see if it's feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients to induce labor in an outpatient setting using a Foley catheter, compared to inpatient inductions using vaginal PGE2.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn the study, 101 women who needed labor induced were split into two groups. 50 women were in the outpatient group and used a Foley catheter for induction. These women were able to go home overnight after a reassuring test. The other 51 women were in the inpatient group and used vaginal PGE2 for induction. The main things checked were how long the hospital stay was, how the baby was born, how long it took from induction to delivery, any side effects, and how satisfied the patients were.\n\nRESULTS.\nWomen in the outpatient group spent less time in the hospital before giving birth, but those in the inpatient group were more likely to have a vaginal birth within 12 hours of going to the Birthing Unit. Overall vaginal birth rates, the time from induction to delivery, and total time spent in the hospital were almost the same for both groups. However, the outpatient group felt less pain and had better sleep but were more likely need additional labor induction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient labor induction was feasible and acceptable for women who are not in a good condition to give birth naturally, however, it did not show a significant reduction in total time spent in the hospital and was associated with increased need for labor induction.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis study has been reported to the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.", "question": "How much vaginal PGE2 was given to the nulliparous women in the inpatient group?", "answer": "Nulliparous women in the inpatient group received 2 mg/1 mg of vaginal PGE2.", "id": 5176, "source_label": [{"start": 859, "end": 966, "text": "OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph.", "labels": ["omission"]}], "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_3", "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_2", "givenness_location": "givenness_location_na", "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_4", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_3", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "hallucinations_answer": "hallucinations_answer_1", "givenness_phrasing_rationale": "nulliparous is not explained/mentioned in the simple text", "givenness_location_rationale": "the information is omitted in the simple text", "simplicity_jargon_rationale": "nulliparous and vaginal PGE2 are not explained", "relevance_target_rationale": "the simple text does not mention that the nulliparous group received 2 mg/1 mg of vaginal PGE2", "accuracy_snippet_rationale": "the next sentence should be highlighted instead", "annotator": 4, "annotation_id": 3726, "created_at": "2024-01-02T19:50:10.748017Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-02T19:50:10.748057Z", "lead_time": 313.582}, {"doc_id": 3570228, "edit_id": "25b31feecf2d985f9fce6af03cf8151e", "source": "The current study aimed to observe the effects of sufentanil and remifentanil combined with propofol in target-controlled infusion (TCI) on perioperative stress reaction in elderly patients.

Oral supply of these fatty acids increases their levels in plasma and cell membranes, often at the expense of the omega-6 PUFAs arachidonic acid (ARA) and linoleic acid. This results in an altered pattern of lipid mediator production to one which is less pro-inflammatory. We investigated whether short term intravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs could change the levels of EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid in plasma and erythrocytes in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwenty patients were randomised to receive a 72 hour infusion of total parenteral nutrition with (treatment group) or without (control group) omega-3 PUFAs. EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid were measured in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) and erythrocytes at several times points up to the end of infusion and 5 to 12 days (mean 9 days) after stopping the infusion.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe treatment group showed increases in plasma PC EPA and DHA and erythrocyte EPA and decreases in plasma PC and erythrocyte linoleic acid, with effects most evident late in the infusion period. Plasma PC and erythrocyte EPA and linoleic acid all returned to baseline levels after the 5\u201312 day washout.

Because of the lack of success of most TBI interventions and the documented benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our study on use of EE in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis.

These individuals were asked to think about happy personal memories to increase the level of a certain signal in the targeted brain area. They did this activity for 40 seconds, followed by rest and counting backwards. Lastly, they did another brain scan without feedback information.\n\nRESULTS:\nPeople in the first group were able to increase their amygdala's response when remembering positive personal memories. Compared to the second group, these individuals also showed a significant decrease in anxiety and an increase in happiness after scanning. When they were not given feedback, their brain activity in certain areas was increased compared to the control group.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur research suggests that people with depression were able to control their brain's response to happy memories using this special type of MRI known as rtfMRI-nf. This resulted in an improved mood. These findings provide preliminary evidence that such brain training using positive memory recall could potentially be a new way to treat depression.", "question": "What kind of analysis was carried out as part of this study?", "answer": "A whole brain analysis was conducted, which means that we examined the activity in all areas of the brain, not just the targeted region.", "id": 5187, "source_label": [{"start": 1237, "end": 1467, "text": "A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.", "labels": ["omission"]}], "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "givenness_location": "givenness_location_na", "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_2", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_3", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "hallucinations_answer": "hallucinations_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "givenness_location_rationale": "the simple text does not mention any analyses", "simplicity_jargon_rationale": "whole brain analysis is explained", "relevance_target_rationale": "the simple text does not mention that whole brain analysis was used for this study", "annotator": 4, "annotation_id": 3759, "created_at": "2024-01-03T21:44:50.608612Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-03T21:44:50.608700Z", "lead_time": 191.816}, {"doc_id": 4006208, "edit_id": "259743fa1d43321e50df3adbad1fb855", "source": "BACKGROUND.\nDue to increasing resistance to antibiotics and rising incidence of oral diseases, there is a need for alternative treatment modalities to combat oral diseases.

Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3).

This suggests that developing more online resources like this could be beneficial for family caregivers, making support more accessible and financially manageable. This is promising for the future generations of caregivers who will likely be familiar with using the internet.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nYou can find more details about this study in the Dutch Trial Register under the code NTR-2051.", "question": "What type of analysis was carried out on the data collected from the caregivers?", "answer": "An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out on the data collected from the caregivers.

From previous trials, we saw that aDBS had a strong positive impact on people with Parkinson's disease. Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.\n\nRESULTS. \nThe treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nSo, we conclude that using aDBS on both sides of the brain improves certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It's also able to adjust to the need for stimulation in patients taking medication.", "question": "How was motor function assessed in the study?", "answer": "The original text mentions that motor function was assessed using double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores, which involves rating the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms based on video recordings.", "id": 5211, "source_label": [{"start": 816, "end": 861, "text": "double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores", "labels": ["omission"]}], "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "givenness_location": "givenness_location_3", "target_label_missing": [{"start": 736, "end": 768, "text": "using a specific scoring system.", "labels": ["concept (missing)"]}], "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_4", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_2", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "hallucinations_answer": "hallucinations_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "givenness_location_rationale": "the simple text vaguely mentions the specific scoring system", "simplicity_jargon_rationale": "UPDRS scores are explained in the answer but double-blinded is not explained", "relevance_target_rationale": "the simple text states that motor function was assessed \"using a specific scoring system\" but does not mention the UPDRS score or the double-blind design specifically", "annotator": 4, "annotation_id": 3824, "created_at": "2024-01-05T17:26:40.215171Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-05T17:26:40.215198Z", "lead_time": 362.184}, {"doc_id": 4984916, "edit_id": "a263f1d377606562259c5ae238a6f031", "source": "BACKGROUND.\nIn the United Kingdom, totally implantable venous access systems (TIVAS) are not routinely used.

We split them into three groups: one group was given a harmless saline solution (55 people), one was given 20 mg of lignocaine (55 people), and the last was given 125 mg of methylprednisolone (also 55 people). We administered the drugs after applying a tourniquet and let it stay for 1 min before giving 1/4th of the typical Propofol dose. We then asked the patients to rate their pain when the Propofol was injected.\n\nRESULTS\nAbout 71% of the patients given only the saline solution experienced pain. For the group given lignocaine, the pain was reduced to about 31%. And for those given methylprednisolone, the pain was further lowered to about 36%. The added drugs significantly reduced the pain when compared to just the saline solution (we used statistical tests to confirm this).\n\nWHAT WE CONCLUDED\nAdding the drug methylprednisolone to Propofol before surgery was as effective as adding lignocaine in reducing the pain of the injection.", "question": "Does Propofol have any other names?", "answer": "Yes, Propofol is also known as 2, 6-di-isopropylphenol.", "id": 5217, "source_label": [{"start": 21, "end": 154, "text": "Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) used for the induction of anaesthesia often causes mild to severe pain or discomfort on injection.", "labels": ["omission"]}], "givenness_phrasing": "givenness_phrasing_1", "givenness_location": "givenness_location_na", "simplicity_jargon": "simplicity_jargon_2", "simplicity_standalone": "simplicity_standalone_1", "relevance_source": "relevance_source_1", "relevance_target": "relevance_target_3", "accuracy_answer": "accuracy_answer_1", "hallucinations_answer": "hallucinations_answer_1", "accuracy_snippet": "accuracy_snippet_1", "givenness_location_rationale": "the simple text does not mention that Propofol is also called 2, 6-di-isopropylphenol", "simplicity_jargon_rationale": "2, 6-di-isopropylphenol is explained to be another name for Propofol", "relevance_target_rationale": "the simple text does not mention that Propofol is also known as 2, 6-di-isopropylphenol", "annotator": 4, "annotation_id": 3830, "created_at": "2024-01-05T17:52:38.360387Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-05T17:52:38.360424Z", "lead_time": 57.037}, {"doc_id": 5350209, "edit_id": "55452d6824c1ae31c434afb78b6badce", "source": "AIM.\nRecent research has shown that adopting strong (i.e. high fear) visual health-warning messages can increase the perceived health risks and intentions to reduce alcohol consumption.

Drugs with anticholinergic properties are of particular interest because many are not recognized for this property; their use may lead to increased anticholinergic burden resulting in significant health risks, as well as negatively impacting cognition. Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions showed promise in addressing inappropriate medication use, but the effectiveness of targeted multidisciplinary team interventions addressing anticholinergic medications in older populations is yet to be determined.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted an 8-week, parallel-arm, randomized trial to evaluate whether a targeted patient-centered pharmacist\u2013physician team MTM intervention (\"targeted MTM intervention\") reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients enrolled in a longitudinal cohort at University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Study outcomes included changes in the medication appropriateness index (MAI) targeting anticholinergic medications and in the anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) score from baseline to the end of study.\n\nRESULTS.\nBetween October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 we enrolled and randomized 50 participants taking at least one medication with anticholinergic properties. Of these, 35 (70%) were women, 45 (90%) were white, and 33 (66%) were cognitively intact (clinical dementia rating [CDR] = 0); mean age was 77.7 \u00b1 6.6 years. At baseline, the mean MAI was 12.6 \u00b1 6.3; 25 (50%) of the participants used two or more anticholinergics, and the mean ADS score was 2.8 \u00b1 1.6. After randomization, although no statistically significant difference was noted between groups, we identified a potentially meaningful imbalance as the intervention group had more participants with intact cognition, and thus included CDR in all of the analyses. The targeted MTM intervention resulted in statistically significant CDR adjusted differences between groups with regard to improved MAI (change score of 3.6 (1.1) for the MTM group as compared with 1.0 (0.9) for the control group, p = 0.04) and ADS (change score of 1.0 (0.3) for the MTM group as compared with 0.2 (0.3) for the control group, p = 0.03).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur targeted MTM intervention resulted in improvement in anticholinergic medication appropriateness and reduced the use of inappropriate anticholinergic medications in older patients.

One group of drugs, known as anticholinergics, can be especially dangerous if overused, as they can have harmful effects on health and brain function. We wanted to see whether a special type of coordinated care between doctors and pharmacists could help reduce the use of these drugs. \n\nMETHODS.\nWe had older patients at the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Center, who were taking at least one anticholinergic drug, participate in an 8-week study. We split them into two groups. One group received extra help and advice from a team of a pharmacist and a doctor, while the other group received usual care. We then compared how the groups changed in their use of anticholinergic drugs over the course of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe recruited 50 patients between October 2014 and September 2015. Most were women, white, and with normal brain function. On average, they were around 78 years old. At the start of the study, half of them were taking two or more anticholinergic drugs. After the study,  the group that received extra care saw improved medication appropriateness and reduced their use of anticholinergic drugs. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results suggest that the additional support from a doctor and pharmacist team can help older adults reduce their use of potentially harmful medications.

Patients and parents completed the revised KINDL questionnaire for measuring health-related QoL in children and adolescents (KINDL-R) at baseline and endpoint. The mean change in CDRS-R total and item scores were used to compare improvement in symptomatology in patients taking OFC and placebo. Tests were 2-sided using a Type I error cutoff of 0.05, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.\n\nRESULTS.\nBaseline QoL as measured by the KINDL-R was substantially impaired relative to published norms for a healthy school-based sample. OFC-treated patients demonstrated an improvement over placebo at endpoint with respect to mean change from baseline in the patient-rated KINDL-R Self-esteem subscale score (p = 0.028), and in the parent KINDL-R ratings of emotional well-being (p = 0.020), Self-esteem (p = 0.030), and Family (p = 0.006). At endpoint, OFC-treated patients still had a lower QoL compared to the normative population. OFC showed significant improvement (p \u2264 0.05) versus placebo on the CDRS-R total score and on 7 of the 17 CDRS-R items.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nPatients aged 10\u201317 years with an acute episode of bipolar depression and their parents reported greater improvements (parents noticed improvements in more areas than did their offspring) on some aspects of QoL when treated with OFC compared with placebo.

These patients were then divided into two groups: one received the drug combination (OFC), and the other received a placebo (a substance with no treatment effect). They were treated for up to 8 weeks. Using a questionnaire filled out by both patients and their parents at the beginning and end of the study, we were able to measure their life quality. We also checked the degree of depression symptoms by comparing scores of specific scales before and after treatment. \n\nRESULTS.\nAt the start of the study, the patients' quality of life was much lower than what you'd expect from a healthy child or teenager of the same age.

Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used surveys about participant\u2019s quality of life and a score system for disease severity. Lab tests were done and compared between the two groups. Researchers also checked if their vitamin D levels, inflammation, and scores changed before and after taking the vitamin D3.\n\nRESULTS:\nEight patients got 2,000 IU/daily and ten got 4,000 IU/daily of vitamin D3 for three months. Vitamin D levels went up in both groups, but more so in the group taking the higher dose. Healthy vitamin D levels were reached in four out of the ten patients (40%) in the high dose group and one out of eight patients (12%) in the low dose group. The quality of life score also improved significantly in the high dose group, but not in the low dose group. The severity scores of the disease didn\u2019t change significantly in either group. Taking vitamin D3 also seemed to lower inflammation in both groups.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nTaking 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 is more likely to increase vitamin D levels in patients with low levels of vitamin D. However, higher doses or longer time may be needed. Vitamin D3 might improve the quality of life in these patients, but it isn't proven yet.

In the multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179\u20130.926, P\u200a=\u200a.032).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nWe recommend using etomidate\u2013midazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol\u2013midazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score.", "target": "ABSTRACT.\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS::\nRecent research shows that using etomidate for sedation during a colonoscopy could be safer than propofol for older people. Both are comparable in their effectiveness. We studied whether using etomidate with another sedative, midazolam, might lead to fewer heart and lung-related side effects compared to using propofol and midazolam. \n\nMETHODS.\nWe carried out a clinical trial at a single center. We focused on patients over 65 years old who were due for a routine colonoscopy. These patients were randomly chosen to receive either etomidate or propofol along with midazolam. We mainly wanted to see which group had less heart and lung issues. We also looked at the patient's vital signs, any issues that interfered with the procedure, and the results related to the use of sedatives.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe number of heart and lung-related issues was higher in the patients who received propofol (72.6%) as compared to those who received etomidate (54.8%). Changes in vital signs were observed in 27.4% of patients receiving etomidate and 50.0% of patients receiving propofol. Procedure-related complications were also significantly higher among patients in the etomidate group (25.8%) compared to the propofol group (8.1%). There were also more cases of muscle twitching observed in the etomidate group (16.1%) compared to the propofol group (1.6%). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of sedation times and how satisfied the patients and doctors were with the sedation process. When it came to changes in vital signs, patients receiving etomidate were much less likely to experience these than those receiving propofol.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFor patients who are at a high risk of complications or have severe medical conditions, we recommend using etomidate with midazolam. On the other hand, for patients at lower risk, propofol with midazolam could be a better choice.", "question": "What was the incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events in the study?", "answer": "The incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%).
