During the rewarming period, we started again levosimendan (10\u03bcgr/kg) in combination with SNP (0.1-0.2 \u03bcgr/kg/min). If mean blood pressure decreased by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values, for corrected of mean arterial pressure, the volume loading was performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate.

An estimate of the annual treatment costs was calculated.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 357 adult oncology patients were treated on 53 different trial protocols: <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">40 phase III, 2 randomised II/III and 11 phase II design</span>. A total of 27 trials were academic, non-commercial sponsored trials and 26 were commercial sponsored trials. When compared with SOC, the average treatment cost per patient was an excess of \u00a3431 for a non-commercial trial (range \u00a36393 excess to \u00a36005 saving) and a saving of \u00a39294 for a commercial trial (range \u00a30 to \u00a371 480). There was an overall treatment cost saving of \u00a3388 719 in 2009 and \u00a3496 556 in 2010, largely attributable to pharmaceutical company provision of free drug supplies.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOn an average, non-commercial trial protocols were associated with a small per patient excess treatment cost, whereas commercial trials were associated with a substantially higher cost saving. Taking into account the total number of patients recruited annually, treatment of patients on clinical trial protocols was associated with considerable cost savings across both the non-commercial and commercial portfolio.</pre>", "score": 0.7542122602, "id": 1369, "rating": "aligned", "comment": "The reference Q/A seems to have misinterpreted the original sentence, but both Q/A pairs are trying to get the same information.", "annotator": 3, "annotation_id": 674, "created_at": "2023-12-07T01:58:54.238431Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-07T01:58:54.238460Z", "lead_time": 85.947}, {"doc_id": 5529957, "model_name": "gpt-4-0613-nli", "reference_id": "2e8b74d4c11e6eb8cbe308c30136060e", "prediction_id": "ce46ed3ae744548c409719732ba93c69", "reference_question": "How were patients assigned treatment?", "reference_answer": "Patients were randomly assigned treatment, with one group receiving a placebo (no treatment) and the other group receiving 2.5mg of the drug riociguat 3 times daily.", "reference_highlighted": "<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Open Sans,Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;\">OBJECTIVE.\nWe compared the haemodynamic effects of riociguat in patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or persistent/recurrent CTEPH after pulmonary endarterectomy in the Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension Soluble Guanylate Cyclase\u2013Stimulator Trial 1 study.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients with inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH (n=261; mean\u00b1 SD age 59\u00b114 years; 66% women) <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">were randomised to riociguat (up to 2.5 mg three times daily) or placebo.</span> Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.\n\nRESULTS.\nRiociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: \u2212285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \u2212357 to \u2212213); p\u227a0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; \u2212131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI \u2212214 to \u221248); p=0.0025) patients.
