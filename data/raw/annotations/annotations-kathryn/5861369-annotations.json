[{"id":5861369,"source":"BACKGROUND/AIMS.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance, adrenal hyperactivity and decreased mental health. We aimed to investigate the changes in adrenal activity, metabolic status and mental health in PCOS during treatment with escitalopram or placebo.\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-two overweight premenopausal women with PCOS and no clinical depression were randomized to 12-week SSRI (20 mg escitalopram/day, n = 21) or placebo (n = 21). Patients underwent clinical examination, fasting blood samples, adrenocorticotroph hormone (ACTH) test, 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and filled in questionnaires regarding mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL): WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5), Major Depression Inventory (MDI), Short Form 36 (SF-36) and PCOS questionnaire.\n\nRESULTS.\nIncluded women were aged 31 (6) years (mean (s.d.)) and had body mass index (BMI) 35.8 (6.5) kg/m2 and waist 102 (12) cm. Escitalopram was associated with increased waist (median (quartiles) change 1 (0; 3) cm), P = 0.005 vs change during placebo and increased cortisol levels (cortisol 0, cortisol 60, peak cortisol and area under the curve for cortisol during ACTH test), all P ≺ 0.05 vs changes during placebo. Escitalopram had no significant effect on measures of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, fasting lipids, mental health or HRQoL.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWaist circumference and cortisol levels increased during treatment with escitalopram in women with PCOS and no clinical depression, whereas metabolic risk markers, mental health and HRQol were unchanged.","target":"BACKGROUND/AIMS.\nThis study looks into polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition often paired with insulin resistance, high adrenal activity and decreased mental wellbeing. It tests the effects of a drug called escitalopram (or a placebo) on these issues in women with PCOS.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe trial involved 42 overweight women with PCOS who were not experiencing clinical depression. They were split into two groups – one group took 20mg of escitalopram daily for 12 weeks, the other took a placebo. The women underwent physical exams, blood tests, and completed questionnaires about their mental health and quality of life. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe average participant was 31 years old, had a BMI of 35.8 and a waist measurement of 102cm. Escitalopram was found to be related to an increase in waist size and cortisol (stress hormone) levels, compared to the placebo group. However, the drug didn't significantly affect insulin levels, lipid levels, mental health or the overall quality of life.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn women with PCOS but without clinical depression, escitalopram increased waist circumference and cortisol levels. However, it didn't noticeable alter metabolic risk factors, mental wellbeing or quality of life.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How were the participants divided into the two groups?","answer":"Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive either 20 mg of escitalopram or a placebo.
