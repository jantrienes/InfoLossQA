[{"id":4937273,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nAlirocumab undergoes target‐mediated clearance via binding of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Statins increase PCSK9 levels; the effects of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies are unclear. Every‐4‐weeks dosing of alirocumab may be appropriate for some patients in absence of background statin but is not yet approved.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nLow‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), PCSK9, and alirocumab levels were assessed in subjects (LDL‐C ≻130 mg/dL, n=24/group) after a 4‐week run‐in taking oral ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or ezetimibe placebo, when alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (days 1, 29, and 57) was added. Maximal mean LDL‐C reductions from day −1 baseline (prealirocumab) occurred on day 71 in all groups: alirocumab plus placebo, 47.4%; alirocumab plus ezetimibe, 56.6%; and alirocumab plus fenofibrate, 54.3%. LDL‐C reductions were sustained through day 85 with alirocumab plus placebo (47.0%); the duration of effect was slightly diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with ezetimibe (49.6%) or fenofibrate combinations (43.2%). Free PCSK9 concentrations were lowest at day 71 in all groups, then increased over time; by day 85, free PCSK9 concentrations were higher, and alirocumab levels lower, with alirocumab plus fenofibrate, and to a lesser extent alirocumab plus ezetimibe, versus alirocumab plus placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAlirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks produced maximal LDL‐C reductions of 47% in combination with placebo and 54% to 57% in combination with ezetimibe or fenofibrate. The oral lipid‐lowering therapies appear to increase PCSK9 levels, leading to increased alirocumab clearance. Although the duration of effect was modestly diminished with alirocumab plus ezetimibe/fenofibrate versus placebo, the effect was less than observed in trials with background statins, and it would not preclude the use of alirocumab every 4 weeks in patients taking these nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies concomitantly.","target":"BACKGROUND.\nThis study investigates alirocumab, a drug used to lower cholesterol levels in the body. The effect of alirocumab can be influenced by other substances in the body like PCSK9, which can increase when a person is on certain medications like statins. This study examines how alirocumab operates when interacting with other cholesterol-lowering drugs that are not statins. \n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nThe study reported the impact of alirocumab with cholesterol-lowering substances (ezetimibe, fenofibrate) in people with high cholesterol levels. Also, how the effects of alirocumab last was assessed. They gave alirocumab to people for 4 weeks combined with other substances. The results showed that alirocumab helped in reducing cholesterol levels in the body, the decreases lifted over time, particularly when alirocumab was used with fenofibrate and ezetimibe.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOverall, alirocumab was effective in reducing cholesterol when used alone or with other cholesterol-reducing substances. Even though there were slight decreases in the drug's effectiveness over time when used with ezetimibe or fenofibrate, these interactions would still allow for alirocumab to be used every 4 weeks in patients undergoing treatment with these drugs.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How do substances like PCSK9 influence alirocumab?","answer":"Alirocumab has target-mediated clearance in binding to PCSK9, which means it binds with a high affinity (or to a greater extent) with the substance, which can affect the potency of alirocumab.
