[{"id":4711101,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nDespite the growing evidence in the literature there is still a lack of consensus regarding the use of minimally invasive surgical technique (MIS) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective, randomized, international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer-assisted TKA (CAS-TKA) using either mini-midvastus (MIS group) or standard medial parapatellar approach (conventional group).  Patients from 3 centers (Maastricht, Zwickau, Adelaide) with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS-TKA without patella resurfacing. The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery, blood loss, chair rise test, quadriceps strength, anterior knee pain, Knee Society Score (KSS),WOMAC scores, mechanical leg axis and component alignment.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients in the MIS group (3.97 ± 2.16) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group (2.77 ± 1.43) p = 0.003. There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters. Surgery time was significantly longer (p ≺ 0.001) and there were significantly higher blood loss (p = 0.002) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group. The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant (–0.43° (95 % CI –1.50 – 0.64); p = 0.43).  There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion/extension (p = 0.269), varus/valgus (p = 0.653) or rotational alignment (p = 0.485) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment (p = 0.778) or posterior slope (p = 0.164) of the tibial component.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThere was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS-TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed, however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss. MIS-TKA in combination with computer navigation is safe in terms of implant positioning.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625311 8 December 2015","target":"BACKGROUND.\nThough some studies suggest that less invasive surgeries are the better way to perform total knee replacements (TKA), professionals can't completely agree on this.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe selected 69 patients seeking treatment for severe knee pain at three international hospitals to participate in a trial. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group received the less invasive surgery (MIS); the other received the standard surgery. Both surgeries were aided by a computer system (CAS-TKA), but did not include resurfacing of the kneecap.\n\nOur main goal was to compare pain and flexibility after surgery between the two groups. We also recorded other measurements like the length of surgery, blood loss, time it took to rise from a chair, strength, knee pain, knee scores, and leg alignment measurements.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwo weeks after surgery, patients who had the less invasive procedure reported significantly more pain than those who had the standard procedure. Additionally, surgeries were longer and involved more blood loss in the less invasive group. However, there was no significant difference in flexibility or leg alignment between the two groups.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings indicate that the standard surgery may have some advantages over the less invasive technique, such as shorter surgery time and less blood loss. Nevertheless, the less invasive technique seems to be safe when it comes to implant placement. \n\nThe trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on December 8, 2015 with the number NCT02625311.","edits":[{"category":"comment","id":1,"annotation":{"comment_text":"For some reason the simplified version uses the phrase \"less invasive surgery\" to replace the term \"minimally invasive surgical technique\" in the original article.
