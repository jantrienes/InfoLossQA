[{"id":5863413,"source":"INTRODUCTION.\nLichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, mucocutaneous disease of unknown etiology. The first line of treatment for oral LP (OLP) has been corticosteroids, but because of their adverse effects, alternative therapeutic approaches are being carried out, of which the recent natural alternative is propolis.\n\nAIM.\nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy of topical propolis in the management of OLP.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe research group consisted of 27 patients diagnosed with symptomatic OLP, among which 15 patients were in the control group and the rest 12 were in the study group. The patients in the control group received triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (topical application) while the patients in the study group received propolis gel. Both the groups were evaluated for pain and erythema at baseline (1st visit), first follow-up (7th day), and second follow-up (14th day) using numerical rating scale and modified oral mucositis index.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe patients in both the study and control groups showed a statistically significant reduction (P = 0.000 for the study group and P = 0.000 for the control group) in pain and erythema scores from baseline to second follow-up visit. However, on comparison of the reduction in pain and erythema scores between the two groups, the difference was found to be statistically insignificant (P = 0.255).\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED.\nChi-square and Cramer's V test were used.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe topical propolis was found to be of comparative effectiveness with respect to triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% in the management of OLP.","target":"INTRODUCTION.\nLichen planus is a lasting skin disease that we don't know the cause of and is often treated with steroids. These steroids can have negative side effects, so researchers are trying to find other ways to treat it. Right now, they're looking into using propolis, which is a natural product created by bees.\n\nAIM.\nThe goal of this study is to see if propolis can be used effectively to treat lichen planus.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe study involved 27 people who have been diagnosed with a type of lichen planus that affects the inside of the mouth. Fifteen of these people were given a common treatment (a 0.1% mix of a steroid), while the other twelve were given a gel made from propolis. Over two weeks, both groups were regularly checked for pain and redness.\n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups - those treated with steroids and those treated with propolis - showed a significant decrease in pain and redness by the end of two weeks. The decrease in these symptoms between the two groups wasn't significant enough to be conclusive.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED.\nChi-square and Cramer's V test were used to analyze the results.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn conclusion, propolis (the product made by bees) seemed to be as effective as steroids in treating this type of lichen planus.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What kind of skin disease is lichen planus?","answer":"Lichen planus is an autoimmune disease, meaning the body's immune system is mistakenly attacking healthy skin cells or mucus cells (the lining of the inside of the body) causing inflammation."},"input_idx":[[36,93]],"output_idx":[[14,53]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What kind of steroids are used to treat lichen planus?","answer":"Corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory steroids) are often used to treat lichen planus in the mouth.
