[{"id":4018698,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nEffective control of postoperative pain remains one of the most important and pressing issues in the field of surgery and has a significant impact on our health care system. In too many patients, pain is treated inadequately, causing them needless suffering and they can develop complications as an indirect consequence of pain. Analgesic modalities, if properly applied, can prevent or at least minimize this needless suffering and these complications.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetic drugs by paravertebral and epidural routes in controlling postoperative pain in patients undergoing hip surgeries.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe study involved 60 patients who were undergoing hip surgery under the subarachnoid block. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 patients. Group I (paravertebral group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 2.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 mL/h in the paravertebral space. Group II (epidural group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 mL/hr in the epidural space for 48 hours in the postoperative period. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, vital statistics, rescue analgesia, and procedure time were compared with the corresponding times between the 2 groups by student's t-test and repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni. P ≺ 0.05 was considered significant. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding mean pain score in the first 48 hours.\n\nRESULTS.\nMean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the epidural group compared with the paravertebral group from 2 hours after start of the infusion until 48 hrs. Regional anesthesia procedure time was significantly longer in the epidural group (P ≺ 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding frequency of postoperative complications and catheter-related problems.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe results of our study indicate that for patients who are scheduled for hip surgery, both continuous paravertebral and continuous epidural analgesia are effective in controlling postoperative pain but that the former has several crucial advantages.","target":"BACKGROUND.\nControlling pain after surgery is a big challenge in the world of health care. Too many patients do not have their pain effectively controlled, which not only causes them unnecessary suffering but could also lead to other health problems. Proper use of pain relief methods can prevent or at least decrease this unnecessary suffering and these extra health issues.\n\nOBJECTIVES.\nWe wanted to compare how well two different methods of giving local anesthetic drugs continuously could control pain after hip surgery. The drugs were given either beside the spinal column (paravertebral) or into the space around the spinal column (epidural).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nOur study involved 60 people getting hip surgery. They were split into 2 groups of 30. One group had a single dose of spinal anesthesia plus a continuous flow of the anesthetic drug beside the spinal column. The other group had the same single dose of spinal anesthesia but a continuous flow of the drug into the space around the spinal column instead. We then compared the levels of pain, basic health measurements, need for additional pain relief, and the time taken to do the procedure between the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nOn average, the group getting the drug into the space around the spinal column had lower blood pressure from 2 hours after the drug was started until 48 hours later. It also took longer to give the anesthetic this way. However, there were no differences in the frequency of surgical complications between the two groups or in the problems related to where the drug was given.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study suggests that continuously giving local anesthetic beside the spinal column or into the space around it both can control pain effectively after hip surgery. However, giving it beside the spinal column might be advantageous in certain ways.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How were participants split up into the two groups?","answer":"Participants were randomly split into one of two groups.
