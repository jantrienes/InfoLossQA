[{"id":4967511,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nProgrammes based on the World Health Organization’s Health Promoting Schools framework (HPS) have been implemented in several countries but for evidence-based policy-making more research is required to determine the effectiveness of the HPS approach.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial. The units of randomisation were primary school classes recruited in May 2010. Eligible participants were Year 3 primary school classes in Lower Austria that had not participated in a similar programme during the last two years. After baseline assessment in September 2010, 53 classes from 45 primary schools in Lower Austria were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 26 classes, 432 children) or waiting control arm (n = 27 classes, 493 children aged 8.7 years +/- 4 months). Over the course of 1.5 academic years, participating teachers received on-the-job training (20 h) and two workshops (8 h) to promote health related behaviour in students such as physical activity during the school day and to improve the quality of regular physical education classes. We assessed 15 outcomes grouped into five categories: Emotional and Social Experience in School, Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance measured by validated and standardised questionnaire and Motor Skills measured by validated and standardised motoric and coordination tests in the school gym. The primary outcome was Classroom Climate and part of the outcomecategory Emotional and Social Experience in School. The final assessment took place in April 2012. All assessors were blinded to the allocation of classes. Multilevel growth modelling was used to investigate programme effectiveness.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe could not detect any statistically significant differences between groups for the outcomecategories Emotional and Social Experience in school (p = 0.22 to 0.78), Physical Activity, Well-being, and Attention Performance. Significant differences between groups were limited to the outcomecategory Motor Skills (Complex Reaction Ability, Spatial Orientation Skills, Coordination with Precision) which were higher in the intervention group (P ≺ .05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nDespite small statistically significant differences in Motor Skills, our study could not detect any clinically relevant improvements in the Emotional and Social Experience at School (including the primary outcome ClassroomClimate), Physical Activity, Well-being, Motor Skills and Attention Performance of students.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nGerman register of clinical studies: DRKS00000622. Retrospectively registered: 03.12.2010. Approved by the Ethics Committee of Lower Austria (GS4-EK-4/107-2010).","target":"BACKGROUND.\nThis summary is about a study of the Health Promoting Schools program, a model from the World Health Organization. This program has started in various countries, but we need more data to see whether it works really well.\n\nMETHODS.\nTo see if this program is effective, we tested it with Year 3 students in primary schools in Lower Austria. We picked 53 classes from 45 schools and divided them into two groups. One group used the program right away (432 children) and the other group waited to start the program (493 children). We checked how things were in September 2010 before the program started. Then, teachers in the first group were trained to promote healthy behaviors like exercising during the day and running better gym classes. After one and a half school years, we checked 15 different things grouped into five categories: 1. Feelings and social activities in school, 2. Physical activity, 3. Well-being, 4. Concentration, and 5. Physical skills measured in gym class. The main thing we wanted to learn was about the classroom atmosphere. We repeated the checks in April 2012.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe data did not show a big difference between the two groups in feelings and social activities at school, physical activity, well-being, and concentration. There was a noticeable difference only in physical skills, where the group that received the program performed a bit better.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEven though the children who participated in the program had slightly better physical skills, we didn't see substantial improvements in their feelings and social interaction at school, their physical activity, well-being, or their focus. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis study was registered in the German register of clinical studies, was recorded after it had started, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lower Austria.","edits":[{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What type of trial was conducted to study the effectiveness of the Health Promoting Schools program?","answer":"A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted, meaning primary school classes from lower Australia were randomly assigned to receive either an intervention or were put into the control group (for comparison) to receive the intervention later."},"input_idx":[[273,402]]},{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What was the selection criteria for participating in the study?","answer":"Participants were from Year 3 primary school classes in Lower Australia, who had not received any similar intervention within the last two years."},"input_idx":[[403,552]],"output_idx":[[298,350]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"How were the teachers trained?","answer":"Teachers were trained for over 1.5 academic years with 20 hours of on on-the-job training and 8 hours split into two workshops.
