[{"id":4555141,"source":"Brain growth and development are critically dependent on several micronutrients. During early development cellular activity may be sensitive to micronutrient deficiencies, however the evidence from human studies is equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term cognitive and social-emotional effects of multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron supplementation alone, administered during infancy. This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (RCT) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6–17 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (MMN) including zinc (451 in each group). The supplementation period for both groups was six months. In 2012, a subsample of 184 children from the original cohort (now aged 36–48 months) was randomly selected to participate in a follow-up trial and was assessed for intelligence, working memory, inhibition, and executive function. The tests showed no significant differences between the supplementation groups though there were some gender differences, with girls displaying higher scores than boys across both groups on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) Verbal IQ sentences subtest, the Day-Night cognitive test and on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) social competency, and boys scoring higher than girls in problem behaviour. The results indicate that MMN supplementation had no long term additional effects on cognitive function compared with iron supplementation alone. The timing of supplement administration for maximum impact on a child's cognitive development requires further investigation.","target":"This study looked at how certain nutrients can affect the growth of a child's brain. The researchers wanted to find out how supplements of various nutrients given in early life might impact a child's long-term mental and emotional development. \n\nIn 2010, they gave daily supplements to 902 babies from Lima, Peru. Half of them got a supplement that was just iron, while the other half got a supplement that included iron plus some other nutrients, like zinc. They did this for six months.\n\nTwo years later, they got a random group of 184 kids from the original set to take part in another round of tests. They tested their intelligence, memory, and other brain functions, as well as their social-emotional skills. \n\nThe results showed that the type of supplement they had as babies didn't make a difference in these areas. However, there was a noticeable difference between boys and girls. For example, girls generally had higher scores in verbal intelligence and social skills, while boys had higher scores in problem behaviour. \n\nThese findings mean that giving extra nutrients beyond iron did not make a difference to these children's cognitive function in the long term. But the researchers reckon more research is needed to find the best time to give supplements for maximum benefit to a child's brain development.","edits":[{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"Why did the researchers feel the need to conduct a study on how nutrient supplementation affects children's brain development?","answer":"Several micronutrients (nutrients that the body needs in only small amounts) are very important in brain development, and early development stages may be more sensitive to deficiencies.
