[{"id":5350209,"source":"AIM.\nRecent research has shown that adopting strong (i.e. high fear) visual health-warning messages can increase the perceived health risks and intentions to reduce alcohol consumption. Separately, it is known that the speed at which alcohol is consumed has dramatic effects on the level of intoxication. In the present study we aimed to combine these two separate areas to understand whether the speed of alcohol consumption is influenced by the type of alcohol health warning contained on the beverage.\n\nSUBJECT AND METHODS.\nIn the present study, female participants (N = 45) consumed an alcoholic beverage in a relaxed environment in one of three conditions: no health-warning label, a text-only health-warning label or a pictorial health-warning label with text.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that compared with the control condition, the beverage was consumed at a slower rate in the two health-warning conditions, which surprisingly did not differ from each other. Despite these effects, product acceptability did not differ between the text-only and control conditions.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThese are the first set of results to demonstrate how the use of strong health warnings on alcoholic beverages can influence actual drinking rate and further suggest that the beneficial effects of slowed consumption are possible in the absence of any reduction in consumer acceptability.","target":"AIM.\nThis study aimed to find out if the kind of health warning on an alcoholic drink's bottle can affect how quickly people drink it. Previous studies found that scary health warnings make people realize the risks of drinking more clearly, and lead them to want to drink less. Another study showed that the faster you drink, the more drunk you get. We combined these two ideas to see if the type of health warning can make people drink slower.\n\nSUBJECT AND METHODS.\nWe tested this idea on 45 women. We gave them an alcoholic drink in a relaxed setting. There were three different groups: one group had drinks with no health warning, one had drinks with only a text warning, and one had drinks with a warning that included a picture and text.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that women drank slower when their drinks had a health warning, regardless of whether it was just text or included a picture. Interestingly, the speed was the same in both health warning groups. However, whether the drink had a warning or not did not affect whether they liked the drink.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis is the first study to show that strong health warnings on alcoholic drinks can make people drink slower. It also suggests that these warnings can be used without making the drink less appealing to consumers.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What kind of health warnings do people find scary?","answer":"Previous research shows that strong visual health-warning messages can influence alcohol consumption.
