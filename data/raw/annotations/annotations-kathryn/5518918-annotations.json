[{"id":5518918,"source":"AIM.\nAlthough cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nWe randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (p ≺ 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p ≺ 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (€437 per patient, 95% confidence interval –562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of €3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval –460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness-to-pay of €0 and €100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWe found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.","target":"GOAL: \nWe wanted to see whether following a heart-related event, at-home fitness programs with virtual support could help more patients stick with their exercise routines and possibly get better results. \n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\nWe tried this with 90 patients who had medium or low risk for future heart issues. We divided them into two groups: one group did their rehab exercises at home with virtual support, and the other group did the same exercises but at a rehab center. \n\nWe found out that both groups stuck to their workouts equally well. However, the people who exercised at home were happier. Also, everyone in both groups got more fit after rehab and kept that up after one year, with no big difference between the two groups. \n\nExercise levels didn't change within one year. Although not statistically significant, it seemed to cost less for the healthcare system if patients exercised at home, by an average of €437 per patient. When we looked at the bigger picture, we also found that the home-based training might save more money – around €3160 per patient. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nOverall, we didn't find a big difference in fitness gains, physical activity levels, or life quality between at-home workouts with virtual help and center-based workouts. But with the folks at home, they liked their workouts more and it cost less overall. So, we believe that for patients with low-to-medium heart disease risk, using at-home workouts with virtual support works just as well as doing workouts at a rehab center.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How does this study aim to improve the results of fitness programs after a heart-related event?","answer":"This study hopes that at-home fitness programs with virtual support will help with the long-term benefits of the program such as maintained physical fitness.
