[{"id":4577567,"source":"Stride length analysis represents an easy method for assessing race walking kinematics. However, the stride parameters emerging from such an analysis have never been used to design a training protocol aimed at increasing stride length. With this aim, we investigated the effects of stride frequency manipulation during three weeks of uphill (2%) training on stride length at iso-efficiency speed. Twelve male race walkers were randomly allocated to one of two training groups: stride frequency manipulation (RWM, n=6) and free stride frequency (RWF, n=6). Results. Kinematic parameters measured before and after the 3-week training in RWM showed increased stride length (4.54%; p≺0.0001) and contact time (4.58%; p≺0.001); inversely, a decreased stride frequency (4.44%; p≺0.0001) and internal work (7.09%; p≺0.05) were found. In RWF the effect of the training showed a decrease in stride length (1.18%; p≺0.0001) and contact time (≺1%; p≺0.0001) with respect to baseline conditions and an increased stride frequency and internal work of 1.19% (p≺0.0001). These results suggest that using slopes (2%) as RWM could help coaches to provide some training methods that would improve an athlete's performance, through increasing stride length without altering his or her race walking technique or metabolic demands.","target":"This study looked at whether manipulating the speed of steps (stride frequency) during uphill training could increase the distance covered in a single step (stride length) in race walking. The researchers took twelve male race walkers and split them randomly into two groups. One group had structured step frequency during their training, and the other had no specific step frequency set.\n\nThe results showed that the group with structured step frequency saw an increase in the distance of their step and the time their foot was in contact with the ground. Simultaneously, the speed of their steps and energy used decreased. The group without specific step frequency had a decrease in the distance of their step and foot contact time but saw an increase in the speed of their steps and energy used.\n\nThis research suggests that training on slopes with specific step frequencies could offer coaches a useful technique to improve race walkers’ performance by increasing the distance of their steps without changing the walker's style or creating extra energy demand.","edits":[{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What is the motivation for this study to look at trying to increase stride length by manipulating stride frequency?","answer":"The mechanics of race walking can be assessed easily by analyzing stride length, however the analyzed factors in stride length have ye to be used to develop a training program to increase stride length.
