[{"id":4313493,"source":"AIMS.\nThe aim was to compare efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2% in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)/ocular hypertension (OHT).\n\nSETTINGS AND DESIGN.\nOpen, randomized, cross-over, comparative study.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nForty patients of POAG or OHT with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≺30 mm Hg were included in the study after a written informed consent. The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 20 patients each. Patients of group A were administered bimatoprost 0.03% eye drops once daily, and those of group B brimonidine 0.2% eye drops twice daily for a period of 4 weeks. After a washout period of 4 weeks, the patients were crossed over that is, group A was administered brimonidine 0.2% and group B bimatoprost 0.03%. Fall in IOP at 4 weeks was recorded. The daily cost of each drug was calculated by maximum retail price and the average number of drops per bottle. The cost-effectiveness was then calculated as the cost of drug/mm Hg fall in IOP.\n\nSTATISTICS.\nIndependent samples t-test was used to compare the efficacy of both drugs.\n\nRESULTS.\nIOP lowering with bimatoprost (8.9 ± 1.598 mm Hg) was significantly (P ≺ 0.0001) higher than brimonidine (6.55 ± 1.26 mm Hg). The number of drops/ml were 33.43 ± 0.52 and 25.49 ± 0.26, respectively, for bimatoprost and brimonidine. Treatment with bimatoprost was costlier than brimonidine with daily costs/eye Rs. 4.02 ± 0.06 and 3.14 ± 0.03, yearly costs/eye Rs. 1467.46 ± 20.74 and 1147.75 ± 11.15, respectively. Bimatoprost was more cost-effective than brimonidine with the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) respectively Rs. 13.10 ± 2.61/mm Hg and Rs. 13.96 ± 2.86/mm Hg. Incremental CER Rs. 10.43/mm Hg implies lower costs/mm Hg extra IOP lowering by bimatoprost than Rs. 13.96 for brimonidine.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn spite of being costlier, bimatoprost is more efficacious and cost-effective than brimonidine.","target":"GOAL:\nWe wanted to see if two particular eye drops, bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2%, work well and are good value for money for people with a specific eye condition causing increased eye pressure (called primary open-angle glaucoma) or high eye pressure (ocular hypertension).\n\nHOW WE DID IT:\nWe carried out a study involving 40 volunteers who had these conditions but only mild eye pressure. We randomly divided them into two different groups. Half of them were given bimatoprost drops once a day, while the other half used brimonidine drops twice a day, for a month. After resting for a month, we switched the groups: the first group started using brimonidine, and the second group used bimatoprost. We recorded the drop in eye pressure after a month for both groups. We then calculated the cost per day of both treatments, and how much it cost per unit of pressure dropped (cost-effectiveness).\n\nHOW WE FIGURED OUT THE RESULTS:\nWe used a common statistical method to compare how effective both drugs were.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that bimatoprost was significantly more effective, reducing eye pressure more than brimonidine. However, bimatoprost was also more expensive on a per drop basis than brimonidine. Despite the higher price, when looking at the cost in relation to how much it lowers eye pressure, bimatoprost ended up being a more cost-effective option than brimonidine.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAlthough it's a bit more expensive, bimatoprost is more effective and gives you more bang for your buck than brimonidine when it comes to treating these eye conditions.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What were the criteria for participating?","answer":"Patients who had either increased eye pressure or high eye pressure, with a fluid pressure in the eye of less than 30 millimeters of mercury were allowed to participate."},"input_idx":[[293,334]],"output_idx":[[372,399]]},{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How were participants recruited for the trial?","answer":"Patients were given all the information about the trial and then asked to provide written consent if they wanted to participate.
