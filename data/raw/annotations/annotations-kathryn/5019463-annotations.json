[{"id":5019463,"source":"PURPOSE.\nPatients with glaucoma who do not keep their follow-up eye care appointments are at risk for developing more severe ocular disease. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nPatients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (±standard deviation) was 71.2 (±10.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155). The mean (±standard deviation) number of follow-up visits during the 1-year study period was 1.3 (±1.3) for G1, 1.6 (±1.3) for G2, and 1.3 (±1.1) for G3 (P=0.48). Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of ≥1 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28). Sub-analysis of adherence rates for patients who attended ≥2 follow-up visits were 91.3% (n=21/23) for G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) for G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) for G3, (P=0.11).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nHelp from a patient navigator did not increase the likelihood of keeping ≥1 follow-up appointment in an office-based setting. Adherence rates for follow-up appointments reached close to 70% or above in a self-selected patient population.","target":"PURPOSE.\nThis study looked at how having a 'patient navigator' - a person who helps guide a patient through their healthcare journey - could change how regularly patients with glaucoma go to their follow-up eye check-ups. This is important because missed appointments can lead to worse vision problems. \n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS. \nThe study used people who were diagnosed with some form of glaucoma after taking an eye test in Philadelphia, USA. These people were put into three groups for one year: one group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator, the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator, and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator. Then, they compared how well each group stuck to their appointment schedule. \n\nRESULTS.\n155 patients were included in this study. They were generally around 71 years old, mostly women, and primarily African-American. The number of follow-up visits during the year was about the same between the three groups. Around 70% to 82% of patients in all groups attended at least one follow-up visit. When looking at only the people who attended two or more follow-up visits, the group with a patient navigator within the community had the highest turn out. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nEven though having a patient navigator didn't make people more likely to go to an office for their check-ups, people did have a decent rate of attendance at their follow-up visits on their own. It is unclear if the community-based care with a navigator helped with the higher rate of attendance for two or more check-ups, which suggests more study is needed.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What factors about the patient navigator are being compared in this study?","answer":"This study aims to investigate how a patient navigator helps patients stick to their follow-up eye check-ups in a community setting compared to an office setting.
