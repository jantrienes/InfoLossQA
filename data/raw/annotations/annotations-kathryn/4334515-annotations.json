[{"id":4334515,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nThe World Health Organization stresses the importance of accessible and (cost)effective caregiver support, given the expected increase in the number of people with dementia and the detrimental impact on the mental health of family caregivers.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis study assessed the effectiveness of the Internet intervention 'Mastery over Dementia'. In a RCT, 251 caregivers, of whom six were lost at baseline, were randomly assigned to two groups. Caregivers in the experimental group (N = 149) were compared to caregivers who received a minimal intervention consisting of e-bulletins (N = 96). Outcomes were symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS-A). All data were collected via the Internet, and an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.\n\nRESULTS.\nAlmost all caregivers were spouses or children (in-law). They were predominantly female and lived with the care recipient in the same household. Age of the caregivers varied from 26 to 87 years. Level of education varied from primary school to university, with almost half of them holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Regression analyses showed that caregivers in the experimental group showed significantly lower symptoms of depression (p = .034) and anxiety (p = .007) post intervention after adjustment for baseline differences in the primary outcome scores and the functional status of the patients with dementia. Effect sizes were moderate for symptoms of anxiety (.48) and small for depressive symptoms (.26).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe Internet course 'Mastery over Dementia' offers an effective treatment for family caregivers of people with dementia reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results of this study justify further development of Internet interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia and suggest that such interventions are promising for keeping support for family caregivers accessible and affordable. The findings are even more promising because future generations of family caregivers will be more familiar with the Internet.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDutch Trial Register NTR-2051 www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2051","target":"BACKGROUND:\nThe World Health Organization emphasizes that support for caregivers, especially those taking care of people with dementia, should be both affordable and easy to access. This is due to the growing number of people who have dementia and the negative effects on the mental health of the family members who care for them.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe ran a study to see if an online program called 'Mastery over Dementia' could help. We had 251 caregivers participate, but 6 dropped out right at the beginning. The caregivers were randomly split into two groups. One group (149 people) used the online program and we compared them to the second group (96 people) who only received informational emails. We wanted to see if there was a change in signs of depression and anxiety. The caregivers answered all our questions through the internet and we made sure to include everyone's data in the final analysis.\n\nRESULTS:\nMost of the caregivers were husbands, wives, or children of the person with dementia. Most of them were women who lived in the same house as the person they were caring for. Their ages ranged from 26 to 87 and their education background varied greatly, with about half having at least a college degree. We discovered that the caregivers who used the online program had noticeably less signs of depression and anxiety after using the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur study shows that the 'Mastery over Dementia' online program can be a useful tool for family caregivers of people with dementia since it reduces signs of depression and anxiety. This suggests that developing more online resources like this could be beneficial for family caregivers, making support more accessible and financially manageable. This is promising for the future generations of caregivers who will likely be familiar with using the internet.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nYou can find more details about this study in the Dutch Trial Register under the code NTR-2051.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How did this study measure for depression and anxiety in participants?","answer":"This study measure symptoms of depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (a self-reported questionnaire that assesses for symptoms of depression) and measured symptoms of anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (a self-reported questionnaire that assesses for anxiety and depression).
