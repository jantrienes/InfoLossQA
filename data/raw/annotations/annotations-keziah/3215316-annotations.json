[{"id":3215316,"source":"Thalassemia is the commonest single gene disorder in India. About 10,000 infants with Thalassemia major are born every year. The present study was under taken with a hope to prevail better quality of life to the Thalassemic patients. Pallor being the chief complaint, a randomized controlled trial was undertaken with Dhatri Avaleha as it is specially mentioned for Pandu, Kamala & Haleemaka Roga. Children between age group of 1 to 15 years were randomly divided in two groups: Drug treated group (Group A) and Control group (Group B). Assessment was done on subjective and objective parameters after 30 and 60 days of treatment with follow up of two month. Statistically significant (Pâ‰º0.01) result was obtained in Blood transfusion interval in group 'A' in comparison to group 'B'. Dhatri Avaleha may have a potential to increase blood transfusion interval and decrease secondary infection and thus it can be used as supportive therapy with modern medical management.","target":"Thalassemia is the most common genetic disease in India, with around 10,000 babies born each year with severe Thalassemia. This study was done to try improve the quality of life for people living with Thalassemia. The main symptom these patients suffer is pallor, or paleness. \n\nThey used a traditional Indian medicine called Dhatri Avaleha, known for treating conditions like anemia, jaundice, and liver disease. The study involved children aged between 1 to 15 years old. They were split into two groups. Group A received the Dhatri Avaleha treatment, and Group B did not.\n\nThe children were monitored before treatment, after 30 days of treatment, after 60 days of treatment, and for two months after the treatment. The results showed that the children who took Dhatri Avaleha (Group A) could go longer without needing a blood transfusion than the children who didn't take the medicine (Group B).\n\nWhat this means is that Dhatri Avaleha could potentialy be used to lengthen the time between blood transfusions and lower the chance of secondary infections. This suggests it could be a good extra treatment to use alongside regular medical care for Thalassemia.","edits":[{"category":"comment","id":1,"annotation":{"comment_text":"Pandu, Kamala & Haleemaka Roga translates to anemia, jaundice, and liver disease"}},{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How was the effectiveness of Dhatri Avaleha studied?
