[{"id":4941128,"source":"INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.\nAdaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) uses feedback from brain signals to guide stimulation. A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of β activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0±0.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.\n\nRESULTS.\nUPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states.","target":"INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.\nThis research is about a deep brain stimulation method, known as adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), where we use feedback from the brain to guide the process. From previous trials, we saw that aDBS had a strong positive impact on people with Parkinson's disease. Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.\n\nRESULTS. \nThe treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nSo, we conclude that using aDBS on both sides of the brain improves certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It's also able to adjust to the need for stimulation in patients taking medication.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What recent trial has shown a positive impact of aDBS on people with Parkinson's disease?
