[{"id":3984795,"source":"To evaluate the effects of probiotic (VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acid on insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, and inflammation, we conducted a clinical trial in 60 overweight (BMI ≻ 25), healthy adults, aged 40–60 years. After initial screening the subjects were randomized into four groups with 15 per group. The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic VSL#3, or both omega-3 and probiotic, for 6 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 weeks. The probiotic (VSL#3) supplemented group had significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL (P ≺ 0.05) value. VSL#3 improved insulin sensitivity (P ≺ 0.01), decreased hsCRP, and favorably affected the composition of gut microbiota. Omega-3 had significant effect on insulin sensitivity and hsCRP but had no effect on gut microbiota. Addition of omega-3 fatty acid with VSL#3 had more pronounced effect on HDL, insulin sensitivity and hsCRP. Subjects with low HDL, insulin resistance, and high hsCRP had significantly lower total lactobacilli and bifidobacteria count and higher E. coli and bacteroides count.","target":"We ran a study with 60 adults who were a bit overweight but otherwise healthy, all between 40 and 60 years old. The aim was to see the effects of probiotics (specifically, VSL#3) and omega-3 fatty acids on our body’s response to insulin, cholesterol levels in the blood, and inflammation. \n\nParticipants were randomly sorted into four groups. The first group was given a placebo; the second group took omega-3 fatty acids; the third group took the probiotic VSL#3; the fourth group had both omega-3 and the probiotic, for a period of 6 weeks. We collected blood and stool samples at the start and end of the study.\n\nThe group that took the probiotic VSL#3 showed a significant reduction in bad cholesterol and triglycerides, along with an increase in good cholesterol. This probiotic also improved the body's response to insulin (which reduces risk of diabetes), reduced inflammation, and positively changed gut bacteria composition. \n\nOmega-3 alone improved the body's response to insulin and reduced inflammation, but didn't appear to affect gut bacteria. However, when omega-3 was used with VSL#3, the effects on good cholesterol, body's response to insulin, and inflammation were more pronounced.\n\nWe noticed that people with low amounts of good cholesterol, insulin resistance, and high inflammation had worse gut bacteria composition. They had significantly less 'good' bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and more of some specific 'bad' bacteria (E. coli and Bacteroides).","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How many people were in each group?","answer":"After initial screening, participants were randomized into four groups with 15 per group."},"input_idx":[[217,305]],"output_idx":[[291,342]]}],"_thresh_id":1,"_completed":"2023-10-22T05:25:11.700Z"}]
