[{"id":3425422,"source":"Postprandial hyperglycemia is associated with platelet activation. We thus investigated if meal-induced platelet activation could be attenuated by meal insulin. A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was performed to compare postprandial platelet activation after premeal injections of placebo or insulin aspart (0.1 and 0.2 units/kg) in 18 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry, without and with stimulation by the thromboxane analog U46619 or ADP. Measurements were before and after premeal blood glucose standardization (to 6–7 mmol/L by insulin infusion, if needed) and at 90 min after the meal. Premeal insulin reduced postprandial hyperglycemia by 2–3 mmol/L compared with placebo. Postmeal insulin levels were doubled with placebo and further elevated with insulin injections. The standardized meal enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression by 23% after placebo; this response was more than doubled after premeal insulin. U46619-induced fibrinogen binding was unchanged after meal intake with placebo but was markedly enhanced (by ∼50–60%) after premeal insulin. Postprandial platelet activation correlated positively to postprandial insulin levels and inversely to glucose levels. Premeal insulin infusion was also associated with platelet activation. Our results suggest that postprandial insulin rather than glucose accounts for postprandial platelet activation in T2DM patients.","target":"This study examines the effects of insulin on platelet activation (a process that can lead to blood clot formation) in people with type 2 diabetes. After meals, blood glucose levels can become unusually high, which can lead to platelet activation. \n\nThis study sought to understand whether administering insulin before a meal could reduce or prevent this platelet activation effect. The experiment included 18 patients with type 2 diabetes and used a reliable trial method where the order of insulin and placebo treatments were randomly assigned and then swapped. \n\nThe process used a technology called flow cytometry to measure platelet activation, which was evaluated before and after the pre-meal blood glucose standardization (if needed, insulin was infused to bring blood glucose levels to a standard range) and 90 minutes after eating. \n\nThe study discovered that giving insulin before a meal reduced post-meal high blood sugar levels significantly compared to the placebo. However, the use of pre-meal insulin also intensified platelet activation after the meal. This reaction was associated with higher insulin levels and lower blood glucose levels. \n\nIn conclusion, the study suggests that post-meal insulin spikes, rather than high blood glucose levels, may be responsible for increased platelet activation in people with type 2 diabetes. It highlights the need to manage insulin levels and platelet activation effectively in the treatment and management of type 2 diabetes.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How was insulin administered to the patients before a meal?","answer":"Insulin was administered to patients through pre-meal injections.
