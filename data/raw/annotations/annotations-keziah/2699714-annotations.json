[{"id":2699714,"source":"OBJECTIVE.\nTo gather preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of etanercept therapy to prolong endogenous insulin production in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nThis was a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at the Diabetes Center, Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo. Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8–18.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3–18 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C ≻6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000–10,000, platelets ≻100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n\nRESULTS.\nA1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 ± 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 ± 1.2%; P ≺ 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 ± 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 ± 0.21; P ≺ 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P ≺ 0.05). From baseline to week 24 insulin dose decreased 18% in the etanercept group compared with a 23% increase in the placebo group (P ≺ 0.05). Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of β-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.","target":"GOAL.\nThe goal of this study was to test if a drug called etanercept could help children with newly detected type 1 diabetes continue making their own insulin for longer.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN. \nThis was a six-month experiment carried out at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo's Diabetes Center. A diverse group of 18 kids aged between 7.8-18.2 years participated. They were randomly split into two groups. One group received etanercept, and the other got a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect). The researchers used standard criteria, including age, health status, insulin injections, and general health markers to select the participants. They treated all participants equally whether they finished the study or not.\n\nFINDINGS. \nAt the end of the study, the group that received etanercept had a lower average blood sugar level and seemed to be making more of their own insulin than the placebo group. Their average insulin dose decreased by 18%, while the placebo group's average dose increased by 23%. Importantly, none of the patients dropped out due to side effects from the etanercept.\n\nCONCLUSIONS. \nThis small preliminary study suggests that etanercept might help children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes maintain their ability to produce insulin. Therefore, etanercept might delay the point at which patients need to rely entirely on insulin injections. More extensive research is needed to confirm this possibility and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach.","edits":[{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What were the parameters of the study?","answer":"The study was double-blind (neither the participants nor the researchers knew which group had the drug, etanercept), randomized (the population receiving the drug was chosen at random from the eligible population), and placebo-controlled (a trial in which there are two or more groups, one of which receives a placebo drug).
