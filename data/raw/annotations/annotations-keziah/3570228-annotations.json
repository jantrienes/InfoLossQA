[{"id":3570228,"source":"The current study aimed to observe the effects of sufentanil and remifentanil combined with propofol in target-controlled infusion (TCI) on perioperative stress reaction in elderly patients. A total of 80 elderly patients requiring general anesthesia were recruited. They were divided into four groups (each n=20) according to different target concentrations of remifentanil and sufentanil. These target concentrations were: 4 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for group I; 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.3 ng/ml sufentanil for group II; 2 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.5 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group III; and 5 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 4 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group IV. Norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in plasma were measured prior to the induction of anesthesia, as well as at several different time-points following surgery. The numbers of intraoperative severe hemodynamic fluctuation, postoperative eye-opening and extubation time, and post-extubation restlessness and pain scores were recorded. Group IV had a larger circulation fluctuation control number and higher levels of NE, E and Ang II at 3 h after surgery than any other group (P≺0.01). Although group IV had shorter postoperative eye-opening and extubation times compared with the other groups (P≺0.05), it also had higher restlessness and pain scores (P≺0.01). The combined use of sufentanil and remifentanil stabilizes perioperative hemodynamics and reduces stress hormone levels.","target":"The aim of this study was to understand how specific drugs - sufentanil and remifentanil, used together with propofol, affected stress reactions during and after surgery in elderly patients. Eighty older patients who needed general anesthesia were selected and grouped into fours based on different levels of remifentanil and sufentanil used. Blood samples were taken before and after surgery at different times to measure certain hormone levels related to stress. We also observed and recorded various factors such as changes in blood flow during surgery, time taken for patients to open their eyes and to remove the breathing tube post surgery, as well as their levels of restlessness and pain after the breathing tube was removed. \n\nThe group that used only remifentanil had higher blood flow changes and stress hormone levels three hours post surgery compared to the other groups. Even though patients in this group woke up and had their breathing tubes removed sooner after surgery, they also reported higher levels of restlessness and pain. The conclusion is that using sufentanil and remifentanil together stabilizes blood flow during surgery and lowers stress hormone levels.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How is the combination of drugs administered to patients?","answer":"The drugs are administered through target-controlled infusion (TCI), which is a computer-controlled way of delivering these drugs based on patient's height, weight, age, gender, etc. "},"input_idx":[[35,136]],"output_idx":[[40,118]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"How many patients were put into each of the four groups?","answer":"20 patients were put into each of the four groups."},"input_idx":[[267,313]],"output_idx":[[243,285]]},{"category":"concept","id":3,"annotation":{"question":"What levels of remifentanil and sufentanil were used for each group?","answer":"Each group had different levels of remifentanil and sufentanil (drugs that affect stress reactions during and after surgery in elderly patients) during the study.
