[{"id":4323432,"source":"BACKGROUND/AIMS.\nSuppression of gastrointestinal (GI) peristalsis during GI endoscopy commonly requires antispasmodic agents such as hyoscine butylbromide, atropine, glucagon, and cimetropium bromide. This study examined the efficacy of oral phloroglucin for the suppression of peristalsis, its impact on patient compliance, and any associated complications, and compared it with intravenous or intramuscular cimetropium bromide administration.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis was a randomized, investigator-blind, prospective comparative study. A total of 172 patients were randomized into two groups according to the following medications administered prior to upper endoscopy: oral phloroglucin (group A, n=86), and cimetropium bromide (group B, n=86). The numbers and the degrees of peristalsis events at the antrum and second duodenal portion were assessed for 30 seconds.\n\nRESULTS.\nA significantly higher number of gastric peristalsis events was observed in group A (0.49 vs. 0.08, p≺0.001), but the difference was not clinically significant. No significant difference between both groups was found in the occurrence of duodenal peristalsis events (1.79 vs. 1.63, p=0.569). The incidence of dry mouth was significantly higher with cimetropium bromide than with phloroglucin (50% vs. 15.1%, p≺0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOral phloroglucin can be used as an antispasmodic agent during upper endoscopy, and shows antispasmodic efficacy and adverse effects similar to those of cimetropium bromide.","target":"BACKGROUND/GOALS\nDuring certain stomach and gut examinations (like endoscopy), it's common to use medications that help relax these areas. This study looked at how well taking a certain medication, called phloroglucin, worked for this purpose, and how well it was tolerated by patients. Its effects were compared to another medication known as cimetropium bromide that's normally given by injection.\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was conducted blindly and participants were randomly divided into two groups. Each group was given a different medication before the endoscopy. Group A received phloroglucin orally, and group B received cimetropium bromide. The researchers then looked at the number and intensity of muscle contractions in two specific parts of the digestive system for 30 seconds.\n\nRESULTS\nThey found that the group taking phloroglucin had more stomach muscle contractions, but the difference wasn't important in a clinical sense. There was no significant difference in muscle contractions in the first part of the small intestine between the two groups. More patients who received cimetropium bromide reported dry mouth than those who took phloroglucin.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPhloroglucin taken orally appears to work as effectively as cimetropium bromide for relaxing the stomach and gut during an endoscopy. It also seems to have similar side effects. The advantage of phloroglucin is that it's less likely to cause dry mouth.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How is phloroglucin administered?","answer":"Phloroglucin is administered orally."},"input_idx":[[225,254]],"output_idx":[[176,218]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What does the medication target to relax the gut area?","answer":"The medication targets the suppression of peristalsis, which is the muscular contractions of the stomach and digestive system that push food along the digestive tract.
