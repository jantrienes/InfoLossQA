[{"id":2639329,"source":"AIMS.\nThe ŒDIPE trial examined the safety and efficacy of an abbreviated hospitalization after implantation or replacement of dual-chamber pacemakers (PM) using a telecardiology-based ambulatory surveillance programme.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS.\nPatients were randomly assigned to (i) an active group, discharged from the hospital 24 h after a first PM implant or 4–6 h after replacement, and followed for 4 weeks with Home-Monitoring (HM), or (ii) a control group followed for 4 weeks according to usual medical practices. The primary objective was to confirm that the proportion of patients who experienced one or more major adverse events (MAE) was not higher in the active than in the control group. The study included 379 patients. At least one treatment-related MAE was observed in 9.2% of patients (n = 17) assigned to the active group vs. 13.3% of patients (n = 26) in the control group (P = 0.21), a 4.1% absolute risk reduction (95% CI −2.2 to 10.4; P = 0.98). By study design, the mean hospitalization duration was 34% shorter in the active than in the control group (P ≺ 0.001), and HM facilitated the early detection of technical issues and detectable clinical anomalies.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nEarly discharge with HM after PM implantation or replacement was safe and facilitated the monitoring of patients in the month following the procedure.","target":"GOAL\nThe ŒDIPE study looked at how safe and effective it was to have a shorter stay in the hospital after getting a dual-chamber pacemaker put in or replaced. This was done using a remote heart monitoring program.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients were placed into two groups: (i) the active group, who left the hospital 24 hours after getting a pacemaker for the first time or 4–6 hours after a replacement, and were watched for 4 weeks using Home-Monitoring (HM), or (ii) the control group, who were monitored for 4 weeks following standard medical practices. The main goal of the study was to check that the patients who left the hospital early (active group) didn't experience more serious negative events compared to those who stayed longer (control group). \n\nThe study had 379 patients. About 9% of patients in the active group experienced some negative events related to their treatment, compared to about 13% in the control group (the difference was not significant meaning the early discharge was not proven to cause more negative events). Also, those in the active group had a 34% shorter hospital stay compared to the control group, and the Home-Monitoring helped to catch technical and health issues sooner.\n\nCONCLUSION\nLeaving the hospital early with Home-Monitoring after getting a pacemaker put in or replaced was shown to be safe and helpful in keeping an eye on patients' health for a month after the procedure.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How were patients place into two groups?","answer":"The patients were randomly assigned to the two groups.
