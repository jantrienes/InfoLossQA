[{"id":4687242,"source":"INTRODUCTION.\nAshwagandha (Withania somnifera [L.] Dunal) has been traditionally used for various actions ranging from vitalizer, improve endurance and stamina, promote longevity, improve immunity, and male and female fertility. However, clinical studies are needed to prove the clinical efficacy of this herb, especially in cardiovascular endurance and physical performance.\n\nAIMS.\nThis prospective, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of Ashwagandha roots extract in enhancing cardiorespiratory endurance and improving the quality of life (QOL) in 50 healthy male/female athletic adults.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nCardiorespiratory endurance was assessed by measuring the oxygen consumption at peak physical exertion (VO2 max) levels during a 20 m shuttle run test. The World Health Organization self-reported QOL questionnaire (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental factors) was used to assess the QOL. Student's t-test was used to compare the differences in a mean and change from baseline VO2 max levels, whereas Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess changes in QOL scores from baseline in the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was a greater increase from baseline (P ≺ 0.0001) in the mean VO2 max with KSM-66 Ashwagandha (n = 24) compared to placebo (n = 25) at 8 weeks (4.91 and 1.42, respectively) and at 12 weeks (5.67 and 1.86 respectively). The QOL scores for all subdomains significantly improved to a greater extent in the Ashwagandha group at 12 weeks compared to placebo (P ≺ 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe findings suggest that Ashwagandha root extract enhances the cardiorespiratory endurance and improves QOL in healthy athletic adults.","target":"INTRODUCTION.\nAshwagandha is a plant that has been traditionally used for a variety of health benefits. These benefits include increasing energy, improving the immune system, and aiding both male and female fertility. Clinical studies are continuing to explore the benefits of Ashwagandha, particularly in improving cardiovascular health and physical performance.\n\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY.\nThis study focused on finding out if Ashwagandha root extract can improve cardiovascular fitness and quality of life in 50 healthy athletic adults (both men and women). It involved comparing the effects of Ashwagandha and a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect).\n\nMETHOD.\nTo measure cardiovascular fitness, we tested how much oxygen the subjects used during a physical exercise test. We also used a questionnaire by the World Health Organization to measure the subjects' quality of life, including physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe use of the Ashwagandha root extract showed a significant improvement in the subjects' cardiovascular fitness over the 8 and 12-week periods, compared to the placebo group. Additionally, the quality of life scores improved more for the group taking Ashwagandha than the group on the placebo, across all categories.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study suggests that Ashwagandha root extract can improve cardiovascular fitness and quality of life in healthy athletic adults.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What other benefits does Ashwagandha have?
