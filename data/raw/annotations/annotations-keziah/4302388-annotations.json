[{"id":4302388,"source":"Dietary intake/status of the trace mineral Se may affect the risk of developing hypertensive conditions of pregnancy, i.e. pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PE/PIH). In the present study, we evaluated Se status in UK pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 UK primiparous women to treatment with Se (60 μg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. UK pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than US women, GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women, and low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3·00, range 0·90–5·80 mg/l). Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0·040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0·054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0·38, 95 % CI 0·17, 0·87, P= 0·021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0·30, 95 % CI 0·09, 1·00, P= 0·049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH. Therefore, UK women of childbearing age need to improve their Se status.","target":"This abstract is about a study that explored the connection between a mineral called selenium (Se) and high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy, specifically, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and pre-eclampsia (PE). Mothers-to-be who consume inadequate amounts of selenium may be more likely to develop these conditions.\n\nThe study involved 230 first-time mothers in the UK who were randomly chosen to either receive a selenium supplement or a placebo from the 12th week of pregnancy onwards. Researchers took multiple measurements and assessments related to the women's selenium levels throughout the pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers found that the selenium levels of pregnant women in the UK were lower compared to those of pregnant women in other countries. Factors like age, level of education, and social class positively impacted selenium levels. Women who ate Brazil nuts or consumed more than two seafood servings a week also showed higher selenium levels. \n\nThe research revealed that the lower the selenium level in the toenails (which is an indicator of the body's selenium status), the higher the chances were for a woman to develop PIH or PE. Women who took the selenium supplement were found to be less at risk of developing these conditions.\n\nTo sum up, the study concluded that women in the UK planning to have children should increase their selenium intake, as low levels of this mineral may increase their chances of developing PIH or PE.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"Where were the 230 first-time mothers for the study found?","answer":"The women were selected from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study."},"input_idx":[[354,435]],"output_idx":[[343,374]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What measurements and assessments related to the pregnant women's selenium levels did the researchers record throughout the study?","answer":"The researchers assessed the level of the mineral selenium in the pregnant women's blood at 12 and 35 weeks, the level of selenium in their toenails at week 16, the presence of plasma selenoprotein P at 35 weeks (selenium in the blood's plasma), and plasma glutathione peroxidase (an antioxidant enzyme found in the fluid outside of the cells) at 12, 20, and 35 weeks."},"input_idx":[[547,777]],"output_idx":[[504,623]]},{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What other information was collected from the women before the study?","answer":"Demographic data about the women was collected at baseline (the beginning of the study)."},"input_idx":[[778,822]]},{"category":"omission","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What information was collected from the women regarding food intake?","answer":"Participants completed the FFQ (food frequency questionnaire), which records how much of different types of a food a person consumes in a day."},"input_idx":[[823,852]]},{"category":"concept","id":3,"annotation":{"question":"How did selenium levels of pregnant women in the UK vary from those of pregnant women in other countries?
