[{"id":5852865,"source":"The accumulation of the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and mesozeaxanthin in the center of the human retina, and known as the macula lutea or macular pigment, is believed to protect the retina from age-related macular degeneration. Since the macular pigment is of dietary origin, supplements containing the relevant carotenoids are readily available. In this study, we compared the changes in macular pigment over a 24-week supplementation period for two groups of 24 subjects each assigned to either of two supplement formulations, 20 mg/day of lutein or 20 mg equivalent free carotenoids of a combination of diacetate esters of the macular carotenoids. The latter group responded with a larger increase (0.0666 ± 0.0481) in macular pigment optical density than the former group (0.0398 ± 0.0430), driven largely by the older subjects. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.0287). There was a general trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for those subjects whose baseline value was high. However, the trend was only significant (p ≺ 0.05) for subjects in the diacetate group. No differences in response could be attributed to the gender of the subjects. We also observed no indication that the use of statin drugs by a few of the older subjects influenced their responses.","target":"There's a certain substance located at the center of the human eye called the \"macula.\" This substance is made up of three components that we get from our diet. Some studies suggest that these components protect our eyes from age-related damage. Therefore, these components are often included in dietary supplements. \n\nIn this study, we gave two different types of these supplements to two groups of 24 people over a period of 24 weeks. One group took a supplement containing one of the three components, while the other group took a supplement containing all three. \n\nAt the end of the study, we found that the group who took the supplement containing all three components had a greater increase in the levels of the macular substance in their eyes, especially among the older participants. \n\nIn general, participants who had higher levels of this macular substance at the start of the study had a smaller increase in levels, but this was only true for those in the group taking the supplement with all three components. \n\nThe gender of the participants did not seem to affect the results. We also did not find any effect from the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs by a few of the older participants.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What are the three components that make up the macula?","answer":"Carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and mesozeaxanthin, which are potent antioxidants that have a profound effect on preserving healthy vision.
