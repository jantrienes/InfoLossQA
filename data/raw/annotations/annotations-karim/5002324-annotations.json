[{"id":5002324,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nThe present study examined the effects of a balance-based exergaming intervention using the Kinect sensor on postural stability and balance in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a subject-blinded, randomized controlled study. Twenty people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I through III) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a balance-based exergaming group (N = 10) or a balance training group (N = 10) for an 8-week balance training period. Postural stability was assessed using the limits of stability (LOS) and one-leg stance (OLS) tests. Balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the timed up and go (TUG) test. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter training, participants in the balance-based exergaming group showed significant improvements in LOS performance, and in the eyes-closed condition of the OLS test. Both training programs led to improvements in BBS and TUG performance. Furthermore, balance-based exergaming training resulted in significantly better performance in directional control in the LOS test (78.9 ± 7.65 %) compared with conventional balance training (70.6 ± 9.37 %).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBalance-based exergaming training resulted in a greater improvement in postural stability compared with conventional balance training. Our results support the therapeutic use of exergaming aided by the Kinect sensor in people with PD.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov.NCT02671396\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12984-016-0185-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","target":"BACKGROUND.\nWe did a study to see if a special type of exercise game, called exergaming, that uses the Kinect sensor could help improve balance and stability in people with Parkinson's disease.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe performed a study where the participants didn't know what group they were in, and it was all decided randomly. We had twenty people with Parkinson's disease take part. These people were either at the early, middle or later stages of the disease. Half of them were put into a group that did the Kinect exergame for balance, and the other half were put into a group that did traditional balance training. This went on for 8 weeks. We used certain tests (LOS, OLS, BBS and TUG) to measure their balance and stability before and after the training.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the training, we found that the group that did the Kinect exergame had better results in some stability tests. Both groups improved in the BBS and TUG balance tests. In one of the LOS tests, the exergaming group did much better than the traditional training group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe group that did the Kinect exergame improved more in their stability than the group that did traditional training. Our study suggests that these kind of exercise games can be helpful for people with Parkinson's disease.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe details of the trial can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov.NCT02671396\n\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL.\nThere's more information online in the supplement of the article.
