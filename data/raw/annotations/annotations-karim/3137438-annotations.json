[{"id":3137438,"source":"OBJECTIVES.\nUsing the fluid filtration method, an in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the effects of medication with calcium hydroxide on the sealing ability of the New Endodontic Cement (NEC) apical barrier in the short and long terms.\n\nMETHODS.\nFifty extracted single rooted teeth were prepared and apical resorption produced using acid sulfuric for four days. The teeth were randomly divided into two experimental groups (n=20) and two control groups. In group 1, calcium hydroxide was placed into all canals for one week and in group 2, no medication was used. In both groups, a 4 mm NEC apical plug was placed in the canals and the remaining portion of the canals was filled with gutta-percha. The amount of microleakage of all samples was evaluated after one week and three months. The data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere was no significant difference between the two groups in either time period (P≻.05). In both group 1 and group 2, microleakage increased after three months but this increase was not statistically significant (P≻.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAccording to the result of this study, medication with calcium hydroxide had no adverse effect on the short- and long-term sealing properties of an NEC apical plug.","target":"GOAL\nThe goal of this experiment was to figure out if using a specific medicine called calcium hydroxide affected the quality of a dental seal made with New Endodontic Cement (NEC) in both the short and long term.\n\nHOW WE DID IT\nWe took 50 extracted teeth and treated them with acid for four days to imitate decay. After that, we separated them randomly into 2 test groups and 2 control groups. In the first test group, we applied calcium hydroxide to all teeth for a week. In the second test group, we didn't use any medicine. In both groups, we sealed the roots with a 4 mm NEC plug and filled the rest of the root with a common filling material. We measured the leakage in all samples after one week and after three months. We then analyzed the results statistically to understand if there were any significant differences.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\nThere wasn't any notable difference between the two groups at either time interval. In both groups, leakage increased after three months but this increase was not substantial enough to be statistically meaningful.\n\nWHAT IT MEANS\nBased on our findings, using calcium hydroxide medicine doesn't harm the short or long term quality of a seal made with NEC.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How was the experiment conducted?","answer":"In vitro, meaning in a test tube, and using the fluid filtration method, a process in which solid particles in a liquid or gaseous fluid are removed by the use of a filter medium that permits the fluid to pass through but retains the solid particles"},"input_idx":[[12,64]],"output_idx":[[5,36]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What type of teeth were extracted?","answer":"Single rooted teeth."},"input_idx":[[258,301]],"output_idx":[[193,218],[229,282]]},{"category":"concept","id":3,"annotation":{"question":"How many teeth per experimental group?","answer":"20"},"input_idx":[[368,435]],"output_idx":[[354,372]]}],"_thresh_id":1,"_seconds_spent":215,"_completed":"2023-11-14T06:06:11.391Z"}]
