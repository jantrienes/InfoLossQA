[{"id":5866486,"source":"INTRODUCTION.\nVestibular rehabilitation is a treatment option for the management of vertigo and unsteadiness, which are very common in head trauma patients and more challenging in the early months after trauma. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a vestibular rehabilitation program in the recovery of acute and sub-acute head trauma patients. The goal of this study was evaluation of the effect of early vestibular rehabilitation on patients with acute and sub-acute head trauma.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThis study was performed in 20 head trauma patients with vertigo and unsteadiness. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: one group received medical therapy (Betaserc) and the other received rehabilitation and medical therapy. An individualized vestibular rehabilitation program was designed that was then revised and verified by a joint committee of vestibular rehabilitation groups. The effectiveness of interventions was measured using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) by comparing the results before and after therapy.\n\nRESULTS: .\nThe physical conditions and DHI scores of patients in both groups were similar at baseline. After 1 month of rehabilitation, patients receiving vestibular rehabilitation and medication showed greater progress than patients receiving medication only (P=0.000).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nVestibular rehabilitation can aid in the recovery from vertigo and increase the stability of head trauma patients. Simultaneous treatment with medicine and vestibular rehabilitation exercises can result in quicker and better therapeutic effects.","target":"INTRODUCTION.\nThis study explores a type of treatment for balance problems and dizziness, which are common after head injuries and can be particularly tricky to manage in the first few months after the injury. The researchers looked at how well this treatment, called vestibular rehabilitation, helps in recovering from head injuries in the early stages.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nThe participants were 20 people who had suffered head injuries and were experiencing dizziness and balance problems. They were split into two groups - one group was given medicine to help with the symptoms, while the other group was given the same medicine but also went through the vestibular rehabilitation treatment. This treatment was tailored to each individual person and was checked and approved by a team of specialists. To see how well the treatments worked, the researchers used a test called the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, which measures how much the dizziness and balance problems are affecting a person's life, both before the treatment and after.\n\nRESULTS: \nWhen the study started, both groups of patients had similar physical conditions and scores on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory. But after one month of treatment, the group that went through the vestibular rehabilitation and took the medicine showed more improvement than the group that just took the medicine.\n\nCONCLUSION. \nThe study found that vestibular rehabilitation can help people who've had head injuries recover from dizziness and balance problems. It works better and faster when used together with medication.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What type of head injuries are being studied?","answer":"Acute and sub-acute head injuries.
