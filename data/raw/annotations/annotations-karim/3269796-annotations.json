[{"id":3269796,"source":"The purpose of this study was to compare a novel bone marrow device with the standard marrow needle in a prospective, randomized study in a teaching hospital employing hematologists-in-training. The new device, the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, utilizes a battery-powered drill to insert the needle. Fifty-four bone marrows (27 standard and 27 OBM) were performed by 11 fellows under the observation and supervision of 3 attending hematologists and 1 research technologist. The primary endpoint of the study, the mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens, a surrogate for marrow quality, was determined by a pathologist in a blinded manner. The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens was significantly longer (56%) for the OBM group (15.3 mm) than for the standard bone marrow (SBM) group (9.8 mm), P≺0.003. An objectively determined secondary endpoint; mean procedure time, skin-to-skin; also favored the OBM group (175 s) versus the SBM group (292 s), P≺0.007. Several subjective secondary endpoints also favored the OBM group. Only minor adverse events were encountered in the OBM and SBM study groups. It was concluded that bone marrow procedures (BMPs) performed by hematologists-in-training were significantly faster and superior in quality when performed with the OBM compared to the SBM. These data suggest that the OBM may be considered a new standard of care for adult hematology patients. OBM also appears to be a superior method for training hematology fellows.","target":"The goal of this research was to compare a newly developed bone marrow device with the regular bone marrow needle. The study took place in a teaching hospital, with medical trainees overseen by experienced doctors and a research technician. The new device, called the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, is powered by a battery-operated drill to insert its needle.\n\nThe research carried out 54 bone marrow tests, half done with the standard needle and half done with the new OnControl device. The main goal measured was the average length of the bone marrow samples taken out, as longer samples usually mean better quality. The ones taken out by the OnControl device were, on average, over half as long again as the ones taken out with the regular needle.\n\nThe researchers also timed the procedures and found that the OnControl device completed its tests significantly faster than the regular needle did. Other measures also favored the OnControl device. There were only a few minor problems in both groups of tests.\n\nTherefore, the researchers concluded that bone marrow tests carried out by doctors-in-training are faster and provide better results when the OnControl device is used compared to the regular needle. Consequently, this device could be favored as a new norm for adult patients needing hematology, and it is a better tool for teaching medical trainees in hematology.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What type of trainees were present in the teaching hospital?","answer":"Hematologists (those who study the blood)."},"input_idx":[[158,194]],"output_idx":[[165,217]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"How was the study conducted?","answer":"It was prospective, meaning results were documented while the trial was active, and randomized, meaning patients were randomly assigned to their groups."},"input_idx":[[105,134]],"output_idx":[[119,124]]},{"category":"concept","id":3,"annotation":{"question":"Who did the tests for the research?","answer":"The tests were performed by 11 of the trainees under observation or 3 hematologists and 1 research technologist (someone who focuses on  developing, designing and conducting research projects)."},"input_idx":[[362,486]],"output_idx":[[377,400]]},{"category":"concept","id":4,"annotation":{"question":"Who measured the average length of the bone marrow and how?","answer":"A pathologist (someone who specializes in the causes and effects of diseases) measured the bone marrow in a blinded manner, meaning they did not know which was taken out by the control group or the new device, onControl Bone Marrow."},"input_idx":[[602,654]],"output_idx":[[500,564]]},{"category":"concept","id":5,"annotation":{"question":"How long were the bone marrows pulled out by the standard group versus the OBM group?","answer":"15.3millimeters versus 9.8millimeters."},"input_idx":[[733,816]],"output_idx":[[705,762]]},{"category":"concept","id":6,"annotation":{"question":"What were the recorded times for the two groups?","answer":"The OBM group had 175 seconds, versus 292 second mean time."},"input_idx":[[934,980]],"output_idx":[[825,911]]}],"_thresh_id":1,"_seconds_spent":831,"_completed":"2023-11-13T07:35:37.218Z"}]
