[{"id":3892495,"source":"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a pre-exercise meal on the plasma human growth hormone (hGH) response and fat oxidation during walking. Subjects (n=8) were randomly provided with either 1 g/kg body weight of glucose in 200 mL water (CHO) or 200 mL water alone (CON) 30 min prior to exercise and subsequently walked on a treadmill at 50% of VO2max for 60 min. Plasma hGH concentrations were significantly higher in subjects who received CHO compared to those who received CON at 15 and 30 min. The fat oxidation rate in the CHO was significantly lower than the CON while walking for 5~15, 25~35 and 45~55 min. Plasma FFA levels were also significantly lower in the CHO compared to the CON at 30, 45 and 60 min. Plasma glucose levels in the CHO were significantly lower while plasma insulin levels were significantly higher than in the CON at 15 and 30 min. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the elevation of plasma hGH levels due to the intake of a pre-exercise meal may not be strongly related to fat oxidation and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels during low-intensity exercise.","target":"This study was about seeing how having a meal before exercising affected growth hormone levels in the blood and the burning of fat during walking exercise. The people in the study (8 of them) were given either a glucose drink or just water half an hour before they started walking on a treadmill at half of their maximum exercise output for an hour. \n\nThe people who had the glucose drink had significantly more growth hormone in their blood, compared to those who only had water, after 15 and 30 minutes. However, the rate at which they were burning fat was significantly lower at certain time intervals (5-15 minutes, 25-35 minutes, and 45-55 minutes into their walk). Their level of free fatty acids in the blood was also lower after 30, 45, and 60 minutes of walking. The glucose drinkers had lower blood sugar levels but higher insulin levels after 15 and 30 minutes. \n\nIn conclusion, this study suggests that having a meal before exercising might raise growth hormone levels in the blood, but it doesn't seem to be strongly tied to fat burning and free fatty acid levels in the blood during mild exercise like walking.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How much glucose was in the drink given to the people in the study?","answer":"Participants were given 1 gram of glucose for every kilogram they weighed.
