[{"id":3926947,"source":"Systematic evaluation of child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient treatment is important but time-consuming. The aim of this paper was to study whether Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a more effective method than a questionnaire sent by post when following up outpatient treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry. Eighty patients were recruited from a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient unit in Sweden. One parent of each of the patients was randomized to complete the BCFPI follow-up form, using either IVR (n = 40) or postal survey (n = 40) one month after discharge. The response rate for complete answers was 65% in the IVR group and 38% in the postal survey group (p = 0.014). There was less need for reminders in the IVR group (p = 0.000). IVR is a promising and cost-effective method for evaluating evidence-based treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric care.","target":"This paper looks at whether using automated phone calls (Interactive Voice Response, or IVR) works better than sending a questionnaire in the mail for keeping track of treatments in child and teen mental health care. The study was carried out in Sweden, with 80 patients from a mental health clinic for children and teenagers. One parent of each patient was asked to fill in a follow-up form about their child's treatment either over the phone or by mail.\n\nOut of these, 65% of those who were asked to use the phone gave complete answers, compared to 38% who got the questionnaire in the mail. Also, fewer reminders were needed for the group using the phone. This suggests that using automated phone calls could be a promising and cost-effective way to keep track of treatments in child and teen mental health care.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What type of treatments are being kept track of?","answer":"Outpatient treatment(s), which is when treatments/services don't require hospitalization or the patient leaves the hospital the same day of receiving care."},"input_idx":[[58,78]],"output_idx":[[168,178]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What type of mental health clinic was used in the study?","answer":"An outpatient clinic, where patients do not stay overnight for treatment.
