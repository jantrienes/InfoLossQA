[{"id":4717319,"source":"OBJECTIVE.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of lurasidone as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia.\n\nMETHOD.\nAdults experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia initially received 12–24 weeks of open-label treatment with lurasidone (40–80 mg/d, flexibly dosed). Patients who maintained clinical stability for ⩾12 weeks were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or lurasidone (40–80 mg/d, flexibly dosed) for an additional 28-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to relapse (based on Kaplan–Meier survival analysis).\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 676 patients enrolled in the open-label phase; 285 met protocol-specified stabilization criteria and were randomized to lurasidone (N=144) or placebo (N=141). During the open-label phase, mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score decreased from 90.1 to 54.4 in patients who met clinical stability criteria and were randomized. In the double-blind phase, lurasidone significantly delayed time to relapse compared with placebo (log-rank test, p=0.039), reflecting a 33.7% reduction in risk of relapse (Cox hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.663 (0.447–0.983); p=0.041). Probability of relapse at the double-blind week 28 endpoint (based on Kaplan–Meier analysis) was 42.2% in the lurasidone group and 51.2% in the placebo group. Minimal changes in weight, lipid, glucose, and prolactin were observed throughout the study.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study demonstrated the efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia.","target":"GOAL:\nWe wanted to see how well lurasidone works as a long-term treatment for schizophrenia.\n\nMETHOD:\nWe first gave adults with a severe episode of schizophrenia a 12-24 week treatment with lurasidone. After 12 weeks, those who showed improvement were then divided into two groups. One group continued using lurasidone and the other group was given a placebo (a substance with no medical effect) for an additional 28 weeks. We then checked the time it took before their symptoms came back.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe had 676 patients in the first phase and 285 showed improvement. These were then divided into the lurasidone (144 patients) and placebo (141 patients) groups. During the first phase, there was a decrease in the severity of symptoms in those who showed improvement. In the next phase, patients using lurasidone took longer before their symptoms came back compared to the placebo group. This was a 33.7% reduction in the risk of symptoms coming back. At the end of the 28 weeks, 42.2% of the lurasidone group and 51.2% of the placebo group had their symptoms return. During the study, the patients only had minor changes in weight, fat levels, sugar levels, and hormone levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study, which involved multiple treatment centers and used a placebo control group, showed that lurasidone works well in keeping schizophrenia symptoms from returning.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What type of testing procedure was used during the 12-24 week treatment?","answer":"Open-label treatment was used, meaning both the patients and investigators of the trial are aware which treatment group patients are in and what treatment was administered."},"input_idx":[[201,221]],"output_idx":[[170,184]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"How much lurasidone was given to the patients in the trial?","answer":"Patients were given 40 to 80 milligrams of lurasidone per day, given flexibly."},"input_idx":[[227,267]],"output_idx":[[185,201]]},{"category":"concept","id":3,"annotation":{"question":"What procedure was used for the additional 28 week study?","answer":"Groups were split in a double-blind fashion, meaning both the participants and investigators did not know who was receiving the placebo vs the lurasidone."},"input_idx":[[341,389]],"output_idx":[[282,358]]},{"category":"concept","id":4,"annotation":{"question":"Who were the patients that showed improvement?","answer":"The patients that met testing standards to move on to the 28-week trial (the second phase)."},"input_idx":[[850,915],[632,673]],"output_idx":[[737,766]]}],"_thresh_id":1,"_completed":"2023-10-10T12:49:08.689Z"}]
