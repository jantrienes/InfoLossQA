[{"id":1774569,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nMany drug users present to primary care requesting detoxification from illicit opiates. There are a number of detoxification agents but no recommended drug of choice. The purpose of this study is to compare buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for detoxification from illicit opiates in primary care.\n\nMETHODS.\nOpen label randomised controlled trial in NHS Primary Care (General Practices), Leeds, UK. Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six months post detoxification were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nOnly 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Risk of non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35–0.96, p = 0.065). A higher proportion of people allocated to buprenorphine provided a clean urine sample compared with those who received dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33–3.21, p = 0.028). People allocated to buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and more were abstinent at three months (10 vs 4, RR 1.55 CI 0.96–2.52) and six months post detoxification (7 vs 3, RR 1.45 CI 0.84–2.49).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nInformative randomised trials evaluating routine care within the primary care setting are possible amongst drug using populations. This small study generates unique data on commonly used treatment regimens.","target":"BACKGROUND:\nMany drug users go to their regular doctors asking for help to stop using illegal drugs. There are many medicines available to help with this, but no one is sure which is the best. This study compares two drugs, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which is better at helping people stop using illegal drugs.\n\nMETHODS:\nThis study included 60 adults in Leeds, UK, who were using illegal drugs and wanted to stop. They were randomly chosen to receive either buprenorphine or dihydrocodeine. The way the drugs were reduced over time depended on what the prescribing doctor thought was best, but it was not supposed to be more than 15 days. The main goal was to see if the person stopped using illegal drugs by the end of the treatment, which was checked by a urine test. They also looked at what happened during the treatment and three and six months afterwards.\n\nRESULTS:\nOnly 23% of the people finished their drug detox treatment and gave a urine sample at the end. If people were given buprenorphine, they were more likely to finish the detox treatment. Those given buprenorphine were also more likely to have a clean urine sample, meaning they stopped using illegal drugs. They also needed to see healthcare professionals less often during treatment and more were still not using drugs three and six months later.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nWith help, it is possible to set up good quality trials in the regular healthcare setting for people using drugs. This small study provides completely new data on how to use these treatments.","edits":[{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"Where are the tested drugs hoping to be used to help patients?","answer":"In primary care, which is day to day health-care rather than specialized treatment."},"input_idx":[[296,309]]},{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"Which illegal drugs are being addressed by the study?","answer":"Opiates, which are drugs such as morphine or heroin that are derived from opium."},"input_idx":[[78,99]],"output_idx":[[80,100],[299,324]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What other parameters was the study done under?","answer":"The study was also open label, meaning both the patients and researchers knew who was taking which medicines."},"input_idx":[[320,330]],"output_idx":[[428,456]]},{"category":"concept","id":3,"annotation":{"question":"How were these drugs administered?","answer":"Buprenorphine was taken sublingually, meaning it is put under the tongue to dissolve, while dihydrocodeine was taken orally, meaning through the mouth.
