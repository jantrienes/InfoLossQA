[{"id":1868720,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nIt is unclear if objective selection of employees, for an intervention to prevent sickness absence, is more effective than subjective 'personal enlistment'. We hypothesize that objectively selected employees are 'at risk' for sickness absence and eligible to participate in the intervention program.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe dispatch of 8603 screening instruments forms the starting point of the objective selection process. Different stages of this process, throughout which employees either dropped out or were excluded, were described and compared with the subjective selection process. Characteristics of ineligible and ultimately selected employees, for a randomized trial, were described and quantified using sickness absence data.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall response rate on the screening instrument was 42.0%. Response bias was found for the parameters sex and age, but not for sickness absence. Sickness absence was higher in the 'at risk' (N = 212) group (42%) compared to the 'not at risk' (N = 2503) group (25%) (OR 2.17 CI 1.63â€“2.89; p = 0.000). The selection process ended with the successful inclusion of 151 eligible, i.e. 2% of the approached employees in the trial.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study shows that objective selection of employees for early intervention is effective. Despite methodological and practical problems, selected employees are actually those at risk for sickness absence, who will probably benefit more from the intervention program than others.","target":"BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at if picking workers based on certain facts (objective) for a program meant to stop them from taking sick days is better than just choosing them based on a hunch (subjective). The researchers think that those chosen based on solid evidence are more likely to be at risk of taking sick days, making them the ideal candidates for the program.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe researchers started by sending out 8603 surveys to begin the evidence-based selection process. They detailed and compared the different steps in this process, which involved some workers not completing the process or being ruled out, to the hunch-based selection. They studied and noted down certain characteristics of the workers who couldn't join and those who were eventually chosen for a test experiment using data regarding sick leave.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe overall response to the survey was 42.0%. There was bias in answering the survey when it came to sex and age, but not for sick leave. The rate of sick leave was higher in the 'at risk' group (42%) as compared to the 'not at risk' group (25%). The selection process ended successfully with 151 workers, or 2% of those contacted, included in the test.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe study found that selecting workers for this kind of program based on solid evidence is effective. Even though they faced some challenges, the researchers were able to find that the workers picked were genuinely those at risk of taking sick leave. These workers are likely to benefit more from the program than others.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How were the workers being subjectively chosen?","answer":"Employees were \"personally enlisting\" in the study.
