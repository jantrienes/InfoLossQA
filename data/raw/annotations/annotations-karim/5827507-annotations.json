[{"id":5827507,"source":"CONTEXT.\nDentinal hypersensitivity (DH) is a chronic disorder in which patients report sharp and acute pain to a variety of stimuli. Till date, a standardized procedure to treat DH is missing, though several alternative treatment strategies have been designed, including laser therapies.\n\nAIM.\nThe aim of the study was to treat DH with minimum chemical concentration and least laser energy level with longer follow-up period.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nOne hundred and twenty patients were randomly divided into four groups: (i) Group 1-5% potassium nitrate (KNO3); (ii) Group 2 - gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (62.2 J/cm2, wavelength - 980 nm, noncontact pulse mode, and power wattage - 0.5 W); (iii) Group 3 - combined 5% KNO3 and the diode laser; and (iv) Group 4 - placebo (control). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded, analyzed, and compared to tactile stimuli, cold water, and air blast tests at different intervals for 6 weeks.\n\nRESULTS.\nSynergistic use of 5% KNO3 and diode laser (Group 3) significantly reduced the DH pain, which was almost negligible after 6th week (97%–99% of the pain was reported to be relieved) and showed promising results than any other studied groups. Further, the diode laser (Group 2) showed better results than 5% KNO3 (Group 1). One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction post hoc test revealed the combination of groups with significant differences in the mean VAS scores at the different interval of time (P ≺ 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nConvincingly, the combined application of 5% KNO3 with the diode laser can be recommended for treating DH patients.","target":"CONTEXT.\nPeople who experience sensitivity in their teeth (also known as dentinal hypersensitivity or DH) often feel a sharp pain when they eat certain foods or drink certain liquids. Up to now, there hasn't been a universal treatment for this type of tooth sensitivity, though some doctors have been using various methods, including laser treatments.\n\nAIM.\nThe goal of this study was to find a way to treat tooth sensitivity using the smallest amount possible of a particular chemical and a low level of laser energy, and then keep track of those patients for a long period of time. \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nOne hundred and twenty patients were randomly split into four groups: one group was treated with potassium nitrate; a second group had a procedure done with a specific type of laser; a third group both received the chemical and the laser treatment; the fourth group received a placebo or fake treatment. They measured the levels of the patients' tooth sensitivity by asking them to describe their pain before and after the treatment. This was done using tests with different materials and temperatures over a period of 6 weeks. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe group where we combined the chemical and laser treatment (Group 3) reported a significant decrease in their tooth sensitivity. In fact, by the 6th week, almost all of the patients in that group no longer felt the pain (97%-99% of them reported relief). This group performed better than the other treatment groups. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nConsidering these results, using a combination of low-dose potassium nitrate and laser treatment seems to be an effective way to treat tooth sensitivity.","edits":[{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What other significant result did the study show?","answer":"Group 2, using just a specific type of laser, had better results than group 1, which used just potassium nitrate, a chemical compound, to treat the sensitivity.
