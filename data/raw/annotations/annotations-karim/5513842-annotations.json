[{"id":5513842,"source":"BACKGROUND.\nCholecystectomy can be associated with considerable postoperative pain. While the benefits of paravertebral block (PVB) on pain after thoracotomy and mastectomy have been demonstrated, not enough investigations on the effects of PVB on pain after open cholecystectomy have been conducted. We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic PVB reduces pain scores, decreases opioid consumption, and prolongs analgesic request time after cholecystectomy.\n\nMETHODS.\nOf 52 patients recruited, 50 completed the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: the paravertebral group and the control group. The outcome measures were the severity of pain measured on numeric pain rating scale, total opioid consumption, and first analgesic request time during the first postoperative 24 hours.\n\nRESULT.\nThe main outcomes recorded during 24 hours after surgery were Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (NRS, 0–10), cumulative opioid consumption, and the first analgesic request time. Twenty four hours after surgery, NRS at rest was 4 (3–6) vs 5 (5–7) and at movement 4 (4–7) vs 6 (5–7.5) for the PVB and control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole observation period was statistically significant (P≺0.05). Twenty-four hours after surgery, median (25th–75th percentile) cumulative morphine consumption was 0 (0–2) vs 2.5 (2–4) mg (P≺0.0001) and cumulative tramadol consumption was 200 (150–250) mg vs 300 (200–350) mg in the paravertebral and in the control group, respectively (P=0.003). After surgery, the median (25th–75th percentile) first analgesic requirement time was prolonged in the PVB group in statistically significant fashion (P≺0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\nSingle-shot thoracic PVB as a component of multi-modal analgesic regimen provided superior analgesia when compared with the control group up to 24 postoperative hours after cholecystectomy, and we recommend this block for post cholecystectomy pain relief.","target":"BACKGROUND.\nWhen people have their gallbladders removed (a surgery known as cholecystectomy), they often experience a lot of pain afterward. So, there's been a lot of focus on how to manage this pain. One method is known as a paravertebral block (PVB), which has been shown to help with pain from other types of surgeries, like thoracotomy and mastectomy. But we don't know as much about how PVB can reduce pain after gallbladder removal. Our goal here was to see if a one-time PVB injection could lessen the intensity of pain, reduce the need for strong pain medications (opioids), and extend the time before a patient needed more pain relief.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied 50 people who had their gallbladders removed in an open surgery. They were split into two groups: one group received the PVB, the other did not (they were our control group). We then looked at how bad their pain was, how much opioid medication they needed, and how long it took before they asked for more pain relief in the first 24 hours following surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found some promising results! The PVB group reported less pain 24 hours after their surgery than the control group did. They took less opioid medication and waited longer before asking for more pain relief. These differences were significant, meaning it wasn't just due to chance.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\nIn conclusion, using a single dose of PVB as part of a pain management strategy seems to provide better pain relief after gallbladder surgery compared to not using it. We believe that PVB should be used to ease the pain after gallbladder surgery.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What type of PVB is being administered?","answer":"A thoracic PVB, which is a wedge-shaped space located on either side of the vertebral column (the spine near the collar bone).","comment":"Still not sure what PVB is, did my best"},"input_idx":[[350,362]],"output_idx":[[469,491]]},{"category":"omission","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"How was their pain rated?","answer":"On a numeric scale."},"input_idx":[[682,711]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"How did they measure the patients' opioid medication needs?
