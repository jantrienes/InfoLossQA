[{"id":4140238,"source":"PURPOSE.\nTo examine the pooled per-protocol ocular end points from two conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) clinical trials of the dual-action antihistamine bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution (BBOS) 1.5%.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at a total of six separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1.5% (n=78) or placebo (n=79) treatment. Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7 minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20 minutes following each CAC. Secondary ocular end points included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators, and tearing (scored as either absent or present) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects.\n\nRESULTS.\nA statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1.5% treatment compared to placebo at all time points (P≺0.0001), while measures for onset and 8-hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, ≥1.0 unit difference) at a majority of time points. In addition, a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia was achieved at a majority of time points during the onset of action CAC test. Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo, most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8-hour study visits. Adverse events were generally mild and transient.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBBOS 1.5% rapidly reduced CAC-induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8 hours after dosing. Certain secondary signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced.","target":"PURPOSE.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess how effective a new antihistamine eye drop (BBOS 1.5%) is at treating eye allergy symptoms.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe research team conducted two trials with the same design involving 157 participants, either using the antihistamine drop (78 participants) or a placebo (79 participants). The participants were given a drop in both eyes during different visits, either 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours before being exposed to a common eye allergen. The main traits measured were changes in eye itching and redness at various time intervals after the exposure. Other measurements including swelling, tearing, and other forms of redness were also considered.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe findings showed a significant reduction in eye itching for those using the antihistamine drop compared to those using the placebo. This reduction was noticed at all time points, and was found to last for at least 8 hours. Additionally, a decrease in redness and other secondary signs of inflammation was noted. Any side effects that participants experienced were generally mild and short-lived.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIn conclusion, the antihistamine eye drop, BBOS 1.5%, was found to be efficient in promptly reducing allergy symptoms in the eye, such as itching and redness, for at least 8 hours after application. Other signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced.","edits":[{"category":"concept","id":1,"annotation":{"question":"What does BBOS mean?","answer":"BBOS stands for bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution, which is an eye solution to help itching under the eyelids that comes with certain allergies."},"input_idx":[[132,198]],"output_idx":[[92,97]]},{"category":"concept","id":2,"annotation":{"question":"What were the time intervals where eye itching and redness were measured at?","answer":"The itching was measured at 3, 5, and 7 minutes, and the eye redness was measured at 7, 15, and 20 minutes after the eye allergen exposure."},"input_idx":[[759,859]],"output_idx":[[526,601]]},{"category":"concept","id":3,"annotation":{"question":"How were the two trials conducted?","answer":"The trial was placebo-controlled, which means it had two or more groups, and it was double-masked as well as randomized, which means neither the researchers or patients know which group received what.
