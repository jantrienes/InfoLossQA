The present study was undertaken with the aim to compare the efficacy of high and low oral doses of haloperidol in the treatment of acute and transient psychotic disorders. The sample comprised of forty patients of both sexes diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic disorder who were randomly assigned to high dose (20 mg/day) and low dose (5 mg /day) haloperidol groups with equal number of subjects (n=20) in both groups. Weekly assessment was done on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Haloperidol Side-effects Check List (day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 & 42). Both groups showed significant improvement in BPRS from baseline scores on all assessments. Comparison of the improvement rate in both study groups revealed no significant difference.","This study is about testing whether high or low doses of a drug called haloperidol are more effective at treating short-lasting mental illnesses. The researchers started out thinking that high doses might work better and faster, but some recent studies have disagreed with this idea. They decided to test it out themselves.

40 patients - both male and female - who were experiencing a brief bout of mental illness were chosen for this study. These patients were randomly split into two groups, with one group receiving a high dose (20 mg/day) and the other receiving a low dose (5 mg/day) of haloperidol. Over a six-week period, the groups were checked weekly for any improvement in their symptoms and side effects from the drug.

In the end, both groups showed significant recovery from their initial symptoms at every check-up. When they compared the two groups, the researchers found no notable difference in how much the patients improved. So, it didn't really matter whether they were given a high or low dose - they ended up getting better around the same amount.",What was used to check patient's symptoms and side effects?,"Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, which is rating scale which a clinician or researcher may use to measure psychiatric symptoms, and Haloperidol Side-effects Check List.",n/a (Unsectioned),5.2 - Outcome (Tool),,

In vivo studies of these microbicides are critical to confirm safety. Here, we evaluated the impact of a rectal microbicide containing the antiviral lectin, Griffithsin (GRFT), on the rectal mucosal proteome and microbiome. Using a randomized, crossover placebo-controlled design, six rhesus macaques received applications of hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC)- or carbopol-formulated 0.1% GRFT gels. Rectal mucosal samples were then evaluated by label-free tandem MS/MS and 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, for proteomics and microbiome analyses, respectively. Compared to placebo, GRFT gels were not associated with any significant changes to protein levels at any time point (FDR ≺ 5%), but increased abundances of two common and beneficial microbial taxa after 24 hours were observed in HEC-GRFT gel (p ≺ 2E-09). Compared to baseline, both placebo formulations were associated with alterations to proteins involved in proteolysis, activation of the immune response and inflammation after 2 hours (p ≺ 0.0001), and increases in beneficial Faecalibacterium spp. after 24 hours in HEC placebo gel (p = 4.21E-15). This study supports the safety profile of 0.1% GRFT gel as an anti-HIV microbicide and demonstrates that current placebo formulations may associate with changes to rectal proteome and microbiota.","Researchers are testing a special gel, known as a microbicide, to prevent HIV during anal intercourse. It's vital to ensure this gel is safe before it can be used by people. The gel in question contains a substance called Griffithsin (GRFT), which helps fight against viruses. 

In our study, we tested the gel on six macaque monkeys. We applied two different versions of the gel and compared these to a dummy gel (placebo). We studied samples from the monkeys to see what effects the gel had on proteins and microbes (tiny organisms that live in our bodies). 

We found that the Griffithsin gel didn't significantly change protein levels at any point. However, it did increase the levels of two helpful types of microbes after 24 hours. On the other hand, the dummy gels caused changes in proteins linked to immunity and inflammation after 2 hours, and also increased beneficial microbes after 24 hours. 

In plain terms, our study shows that the Griffithsin gel doesn't harm the rectum's proteins or microbes, implying it's safe to use.

The new device, the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, utilizes a battery-powered drill to insert the needle. Fifty-four bone marrows (27 standard and 27 OBM) were performed by 11 fellows under the observation and supervision of 3 attending hematologists and 1 research technologist. The primary endpoint of the study, the mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens, a surrogate for marrow quality, was determined by a pathologist in a blinded manner. The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens was significantly longer (56%) for the OBM group (15.3 mm) than for the standard bone marrow (SBM) group (9.8 mm), P≺0.003. An objectively determined secondary endpoint; mean procedure time, skin-to-skin; also favored the OBM group (175 s) versus the SBM group (292 s), P≺0.007. Several subjective secondary endpoints also favored the OBM group. Only minor adverse events were encountered in the OBM and SBM study groups. It was concluded that bone marrow procedures (BMPs) performed by hematologists-in-training were significantly faster and superior in quality when performed with the OBM compared to the SBM. These data suggest that the OBM may be considered a new standard of care for adult hematology patients. OBM also appears to be a superior method for training hematology fellows.","The goal of this research was to compare a newly developed bone marrow device with the regular bone marrow needle. The study took place in a teaching hospital, with medical trainees overseen by experienced doctors and a research technician. The new device, called the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, is powered by a battery-operated drill to insert its needle.

The research carried out 54 bone marrow tests, half done with the standard needle and half done with the new OnControl device. The main goal measured was the average length of the bone marrow samples taken out, as longer samples usually mean better quality. The ones taken out by the OnControl device were, on average, over half as long again as the ones taken out with the regular needle.

The researchers also timed the procedures and found that the OnControl device completed its tests significantly faster than the regular needle did. Other measures also favored the OnControl device. There were only a few minor problems in both groups of tests.

Therefore, the researchers concluded that bone marrow tests carried out by doctors-in-training are faster and provide better results when the OnControl device is used compared to the regular needle.

Induction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.

METHODS.
In a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 ± 2, 50 ± 2 and 40 ± 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.

RESULTS.
BIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
These results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.","BACKGROUND.
Getting the right level of anesthesia for a surgery is very important. For children, the most common method is to have them breathe in the anesthetic. A tube may need to be put down the throat once the child is deeply asleep. It can be hard to tell exactly how deep the sleep is. One way to measure this is using something called a Bispectral index (BIS). In this study, we wanted to see how well the BIS can tell us when a child is asleep enough for the tube to be safely put in.
METHODS.
We did a test with ninety children who were aged 1 to 6 years and were about to have surgery. We started to monitor their BIS and separated them randomly into three groups. The anesthesia was started by gradually increasing the amount of anesthetic in a mix of oxygen and nitrous oxide. We kept increasing until the BIS reached certain target levels. After the tube was put in, we noted how long the process took, whether there were any complications like trouble breathing, if the child moved, and how long they stayed asleep. RESULTS.
The BIS didn't help us to know the best level of anesthesia for putting the tube in. There was no difference in how long it took, whether there were any problems, or how long the children stayed asleep between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS.
Our results showed that there wasn't a significant difference in problems related to putting in the tube at different BIS levels. To make sure the level of anesthesia is deep enough, we might need to aim for lower BIS values.",What was the mixture ratio or oxygen and nitrous oxide?,50%,Methods,5.4 - Quantity,,

Neck pain in chronic whiplash syndrome is a major burden for patients, healthcare providers and insurance companies. Randomized data on treatment of botulinum toxin in chronic whiplash syndrome are scarce. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to prove efficacy of botulinum toxin for neck pain in chronic whiplash syndrome.

METHODS.
40 patients with chronic whiplash syndrome (whiplash associated disorders grade 1 and 2) were randomly assigned to receive botulinum toxin (maximum 100 units) or placebo (saline) in muscles with increased tenderness.

RESULTS.
After 12 weeks there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in decrease of neck pain intensity on VAS (−7.0 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) [−20.7 to +6.7]), mean number of neck pain days (−1%; 95% CI [−15% to +13%]), neck pain hours per day (−0.14; 95% CI [−3.0 to +2.7]), days on which symptomatic treatment was taken (−0.7%; 95% CI [−15% to +13%]) number of analgesics taken per day (−0.14; 95% CI [−0.6 to +0.4]) and total cervical range of motion (−11 degrees; 95% CI [−40 to +17]). There also was no significant difference in patient’s assessment of improvement after week 4, 8 and 12.

CONCLUSIONS.
Botulinum toxin was not proven effective in treatment of neck pain in chronic whiplash syndrome. Increased muscle tenderness alone might not be the major cause of neck pain in whiplash syndrome.","OBJECTIVES
Many people who have long-term neck pain after a whiplash injury find it hard to manage, as do the healthcare professionals and insurance companies involved in their care. One possible treatment for this pain is a drug called botulinum toxin, but good quality research is lacking on its effectiveness. So, we ran a scientifically robust study to find out if botulinum toxin really does help reduce neck pain in these patients.

METHODS
We had 40 patients who all had long-term whiplash injury. They were randomly put into two groups. One group had injections of botulinum toxin and the other group had injections of a harmless saltwater solution (the placebo) into their painful neck muscles.

RESULTS
We checked on the patients after 12 weeks and found no big differences between the two groups. We looked at how intense their neck pain was, how many days they had neck pain, how many hours a day they had neck pain, how many days they needed treatment to relieve their symptoms, how many painkillers they took each day, and how much they could move their necks. There was also no big difference in how much the patients felt they had improved over the 4, 8 and 12 weeks of the study.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on our results, we couldn't say that botulinum toxin is effective in treating neck pain in people with long-term whiplash. It seems that having tender muscles might not be the main cause of this kind of neck pain.",How many injections of botulinum toxin did patients in the study have?,No more than 100 units.,Methods,5.4 - Quantity,,

The conduct of clinical trials should be an integral part of routine patient care. Treating patients in trials incurs additional costs over and above standard of care (SOC), but the extent of the cost burden is not known. We undertook a retrospective cost attribution analysis to quantitate the treatment costs associated with cancer clinical trial protocols conducted over a 2 year period.

METHODS.
All patients entered into oncology (non-haematology) clinical trials involving investigational medicinal products in 2009 and 2010 in a single UK institution were identified. The trial protocols on which they were treated were analysed to identify the treatment costs for the experimental arm(s) of the trial and the equivalent SOC had the patient not been entered in the trial. The treatment cost difference was calculated by subtracting the experimental treatment cost from SOC cost. For randomised trials, an average treatment cost was estimated by taking into account the number of arms and randomisation ratio. An estimate of the annual treatment costs was calculated.

RESULTS.
A total of 357 adult oncology patients were treated on 53 different trial protocols: 40 phase III, 2 randomised II/III and 11 phase II design. A total of 27 trials were academic, non-commercial sponsored trials and 26 were commercial sponsored trials. When compared with SOC, the average treatment cost per patient was an excess of £431 for a non-commercial trial (range £6393 excess to £6005 saving) and a saving of £9294 for a commercial trial (range £0 to £71 480). There was an overall treatment cost saving of £388 719 in 2009 and £496 556 in 2010, largely attributable to pharmaceutical company provision of free drug supplies.

CONCLUSION.
On an average, non-commercial trial protocols were associated with a small per patient excess treatment cost, whereas commercial trials were associated with a substantially higher cost saving. Taking into account the total number of patients recruited annually, treatment of patients on clinical trial protocols was associated with considerable cost savings across both the non-commercial and commercial portfolio.","BACKGROUND
Clinical trials are part of regular medical care. These trials, though, can cost more than standard treatments. We looked at cancer clinical trials over two years to figure out how much extra they cost.

METHODS
We found and studied all patients who took part in drug-based cancer clinical trials in 2009 and 2010 at one hospital in the UK. We compared the cost of the treatments in the trials and the usual treatments the patients could have received. We figured out the difference in cost between these two. For studies that compared treatments, we estimated the average treatment cost. We also estimated the yearly costs.

RESULTS
During those two years, 357 adult cancer patients took part in 53 different research studies. Some of these were designed by universities and other non-profit groups, while others were sponsored by drug companies. On average, the university trials cost an extra £431 per patient. The drug company trials, on the other hand, saved an average of £9294 per patient. This is largely because these companies supplied the drugs for free. In total, these trials saved about £885,275 over the two years.

CONCLUSION
In general, trials designed by universities cost a little more per patient. Drug company trials, though, saved much more money. Given the large number of patients that take part in these trials every year, they can lead to big savings, regardless of who runs them.",How many research studies were done by universities/other non-profits vs drug companies?,Non-commercial sponsored trials had a total of 27 and company sponsored trials had 26.,Results,5.5 - Population,,

It is hypothesised that individuals with knowledge of their genetic risk are more likely to make health-promoting dietary and lifestyle changes. The present study aims to test this hypothesis using data from the Food4Me study. This was a 6-month Internet-based randomised controlled trial conducted across seven centres in Europe where individuals received either general healthy eating advice or varying levels of personalised nutrition advice. Participants who received genotype-based personalised advice were informed whether they had the risk (CT/TT) (n = 178) or non-risk (CC) (n = 141) alleles of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in relation to cardiovascular health and the importance of a sufficient intake of folate. General linear model analysis was used to assess changes in folate intake between the MTHFR risk, MTHFR non-risk and control groups from baseline to month 6 of the intervention.

RESULTS.
There were no differences between the groups for age, gender or BMI. However, there was a significant difference in country distribution between the groups (p = 0.010). Baseline folate intakes were 412 ± 172, 391 ± 190 and 410 ± 186 μg per 10 MJ for the risk, non-risk and control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of changes in folate intakes from baseline to month 6. Similarly, there were no changes in reported intake of food groups high in folate.

CONCLUSIONS.
These results suggest that knowledge of MTHFR 677C → T genotype did not improve folate intake in participants with the risk variant compared with those with the non-risk variant.

The researchers wanted to see if knowing about your personal genetic risks would encourage you to make healthier diet and lifestyle choices. They ran a 6-month online trial across seven locations in Europe. Some people received general healthy eating advice while others received advice tailored to their personal nutrition needs. One specific group learned whether they had a certain gene variant that increased their risk of heart disease. They were told about the importance of eating enough folate, a type of B vitamin. The researchers then analyzed changes in their folate intake over six months. 

RESULTS.
There wasn't any difference in age, gender, or body weight between the groups. Although, the number of participants from each country was not evenly spread across the groups. The amount of folate the groups ate at the start of the trial was about the same. Over six months, no group's folate intake changed significantly.

The finding implies that just knowing if you have a risky gene variant does not necessarily encourage you to eat more folate.

Intravenous fluid is recommended in international guidelines to improve patient post-operative symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting. The optimum fluid regimen has not been established. This prospective, randomized, blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid (hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution (Hartmann's Solution).

METHODS.
120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid (N = 60) or crystalloid (N = 60) intra-operatively. The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting. Patients were interviewed to assess nausea, vomiting, anti-emetic use, dizziness, sore throat, headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2, 24 and 48 hours post operatively. Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup.

RESULTS.
At 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea (38.2 % vs 17.9%, P = 0.03) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively (1.49 ± 0.3 vs 0.68 ± 0.2, P = 0.028). The incidence of vomiting and anti-emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups. Sore throat, dizziness, headache and general well being were not different between the groups. A comparable reduction on post-operative FVC and FEV-1 and PEFR was observed in both groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
Intra-operative administration of colloid increased the incidence of early postoperative nausea and has no advantage over crystalloid for symptom control after gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.","BACKGROUND.
This study aimed to find if using either of two kinds of fluids during surgery could help reduce the feelings of nausea and vomiting that patients often have after surgery. The fluids we used were known as colloid and crystalloid, and we administered them via an IV drip during a specific type of gynecologic surgery called laparoscopy.

METHODS.
We randomly divided 120 patients to either receive the colloid or crystalloid fluid during their surgery. The amount of fluid we gave was based on the patient's weight and how many hours they had gone without food. After surgery, we checked up on the patients four times (30 minutes, 2 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery) to ask them about their symptoms. In a smaller set of patients, we also tested how well their lungs were working.

RESULTS.
We found that two hours after surgery, more patients that had received the colloid fluid felt nauseous (38.2% vs 17.9%) and their nausea was also worse than those who had received the crystalloid fluid. Vomiting and use of anti-nausea medication were low in both groups. We didn't see any differences when comparing symptoms like sore throat, dizziness, headache or general well-being. Both kinds of fluid caused similar reductions in lung function.

The present study examined the effects of a balance-based exergaming intervention using the Kinect sensor on postural stability and balance in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).

METHODS.
We conducted a subject-blinded, randomized controlled study. Twenty people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I through III) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a balance-based exergaming group (N = 10) or a balance training group (N = 10) for an 8-week balance training period. Postural stability was assessed using the limits of stability (LOS) and one-leg stance (OLS) tests. Balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the timed up and go (TUG) test. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training.

RESULTS.
After training, participants in the balance-based exergaming group showed significant improvements in LOS performance, and in the eyes-closed condition of the OLS test. Both training programs led to improvements in BBS and TUG performance. Furthermore, balance-based exergaming training resulted in significantly better performance in directional control in the LOS test (78.9 ± 7.65 %) compared with conventional balance training (70.6 ± 9.37 %).

CONCLUSIONS.
Balance-based exergaming training resulted in a greater improvement in postural stability compared with conventional balance training. Our results support the therapeutic use of exergaming aided by the Kinect sensor in people with PD.

After the training, we found that the group that did the Kinect exergame had better results in some stability tests. Both groups improved in the BBS and TUG balance tests. In one of the LOS tests, the exergaming group did much better than the traditional training group.

CONCLUSIONS.
The group that did the Kinect exergame improved more in their stability than the group that did traditional training. Our study suggests that these kind of exercise games can be helpful for people with Parkinson's disease.

This study investigated the effect of combining oral dexamethasone with either nebulized racemic epinephrine or salbutamol compared to bronchodilators alone for the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial on infants (1 to 12 months) who were diagnosed in the emergency department with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of the first dose of treatment, and the secondary outcomes were changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument score, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) over a 4-hour observation period. Infants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to four groups: A (dexamethasone + racemic epinephrine) = 45, B (placebo and racemic epinephrine) =39, C (dexamethasone and salbutamol) = 40, or D (placebo and salbutamol) = 38.

RESULTS.
Patients who had received dexamethasone + epinephrine exhibited similar admission rates compared to placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.64). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of hospitalization for patients who received dexamethasone + salbutamol compared to those who received placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.51). Clinical parameters were improved at the end of the 4-hour observation period for all treatment groups. Treatment with dexamethasone + epinephrine resulted in a statistically significant change in HR over time (P ≺ 0.005) compared to the other groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
This study adds to a body of evidence suggesting that corticosteroids have no role in the management of bronchiolitis for young infants who are first time wheezers with no risk of atopy.","BACKGROUND.
This research looked at how well infants with a common lung infection called bronchiolitis responded to different combinations of medicines. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study investigated the effects on babies between 1 to 12 months old. The babies were divided into four groups and were given different combinations of drugs. The major goal was to see if combining these drugs could reduce the need for hospital stays. 

RESULTS.
The study showed that the combination of dexamethasone and epinephrine resulted in the same number of hospital admissions as the other combinations. This was also the case for the combination of dexamethasone and salbutamol. However, the babies receiving these combinations showed improvements in their breathing and heart rates.

In vivo studies of these microbicides are critical to confirm safety. Here, we evaluated the impact of a rectal microbicide containing the antiviral lectin, Griffithsin (GRFT), on the rectal mucosal proteome and microbiome. Using a randomized, crossover placebo-controlled design, six rhesus macaques received applications of hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC)- or carbopol-formulated 0.1% GRFT gels. Rectal mucosal samples were then evaluated by label-free tandem MS/MS and 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, for proteomics and microbiome analyses, respectively. Compared to placebo, GRFT gels were not associated with any significant changes to protein levels at any time point (FDR ≺ 5%), but increased abundances of two common and beneficial microbial taxa after 24 hours were observed in HEC-GRFT gel (p ≺ 2E-09). Compared to baseline, both placebo formulations were associated with alterations to proteins involved in proteolysis, activation of the immune response and inflammation after 2 hours (p ≺ 0.0001), and increases in beneficial Faecalibacterium spp. after 24 hours in HEC placebo gel (p = 4.21E-15).

It's vital to ensure this gel is safe before it can be used by people. The gel in question contains a substance called Griffithsin (GRFT), which helps fight against viruses.

We found that the Griffithsin gel didn't significantly change protein levels at any point. However, it did increase the levels of two helpful types of microbes after 24 hours. On the other hand, the dummy gels caused changes in proteins linked to immunity and inflammation after 2 hours, and also increased beneficial microbes after 24 hours.

Many drug users present to primary care requesting detoxification from illicit opiates. There are a number of detoxification agents but no recommended drug of choice. The purpose of this study is to compare buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for detoxification from illicit opiates in primary care.

METHODS.
Open label randomised controlled trial in NHS Primary Care (General Practices), Leeds, UK. Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six months post detoxification were recorded.

RESULTS.
Only 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Risk of non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35–0.96, p = 0.065). A higher proportion of people allocated to buprenorphine provided a clean urine sample compared with those who received dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33–3.21, p = 0.028). People allocated to buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and more were abstinent at three months (10 vs 4, RR 1.55 CI 0.96–2.52) and six months post detoxification (7 vs 3, RR 1.45 CI 0.84–2.49).

CONCLUSION.
Informative randomised trials evaluating routine care within the primary care setting are possible amongst drug using populations. This small study generates unique data on commonly used treatment regimens.","BACKGROUND:
Many drug users go to their regular doctors asking for help to stop using illegal drugs. There are many medicines available to help with this, but no one is sure which is the best. This study compares two drugs, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which is better at helping people stop using illegal drugs.

METHODS:
This study included 60 adults in Leeds, UK, who were using illegal drugs and wanted to stop. They were randomly chosen to receive either buprenorphine or dihydrocodeine. The way the drugs were reduced over time depended on what the prescribing doctor thought was best, but it was not supposed to be more than 15 days. The main goal was to see if the person stopped using illegal drugs by the end of the treatment, which was checked by a urine test. They also looked at what happened during the treatment and three and six months afterwards.

RESULTS:
Only 23% of the people finished their drug detox treatment and gave a urine sample at the end. If people were given buprenorphine, they were more likely to finish the detox treatment. Those given buprenorphine were also more likely to have a clean urine sample, meaning they stopped using illegal drugs. They also needed to see healthcare professionals less often during treatment and more were still not using drugs three and six months later.

Protein-rich nutrition is necessary for wound healing after surgery. In this study, the benefit of preoperative nutritional support was investigated for non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent anatomic resection.

METHODS.
A prospective study was planned with the approval of our institutional review board. Fifty-eight patients who underwent anatomic resection in our department between January 2014 and December 2014 were randomized. Thirty-one patients were applied a preoperative nutrition program with immune modulating formulae (enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids and nucleotides) for ten days. There were 27 patients in the control group who were fed with only normal diet. Patients who were malnourished, diabetic or who had undergone bronchoplastic procedures or neoadjuvant therapy were excluded from the study. Patients’ baseline serum albumin levels, defined as the serum albumin level before any nutrition program, and the serum albumin levels on the postoperative third day were calculated and recorded with the other data.

RESULTS.
Anatomic resection was performed by thoracotomy in 20 patients, and 11 patients were operated by videothoracoscopy in the nutrition program group. On the other hand 16 patients were operated by thoracotomy and 11 patients were operated by videothoracoscopy in the control group. In the control group, the patients’ albumin levels decreased to 25.71 % of the baseline on the postoperative third day, but this reduction was only 14.69 % for nutrition program group patients and the difference was statistically significant (p ≺ 0.001). Complications developed in 12 patients (44.4 %) in the control group compared to 6 patients in the nutrition group (p = 0.049). The mean chest tube drainage time was 6 (1–42) days in the control group against 4 (2–15) days for the nutrition program group (p = 0.019).

CONCLUSIONS.
Our study showed that preoperative nutrition is beneficial in decreasing the complications and chest tube removal time in non-small cell lung cancer patients that were applied anatomic resection with a reduction of 25 % in the postoperative albumin levels of non-malnourished patients who underwent resection.","OBJECTIVE.
This study looked at if eating a protein-rich diet before surgery could help lung cancer patients recover more quickly after surgery.

METHODS.
We got permission to conduct an experiment on 58 lung cancer patients who were about to have surgery at our hospital between January and December 2014. We divided these patients randomly into two groups. The first group, 31 patients, followed a special diet for ten days before their surgery. This diet included specific nutrients known to boost the immune system. The second group, 27 patients, ate their regular meals. We didn’t include patients who were already not eating well, had diabetes, or had received other treatments for their lung cancer. We measured levels of a protein in their blood before they started the special diet and again three days after their surgery. We also recorded other data, like if they had any problems after the surgery and how long a chest drain needed to stay in after the surgery.

RESULTS.
We did the surgery in two different ways in both groups, either opening up the chest or using a video camera to guide the surgery. The patients who didn't have the special diet saw a larger drop in their blood protein levels three days after the surgery. In this group, about 44% of patients had problems after their surgery compared to 19% in the special diet group. Also, the patients in the special diet group had their chest drain removed quicker after the surgery.

A link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently been suggested. Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52–85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale–Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.

RESULTS.
Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI ≥6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus −3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (−3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.

CONCLUSION.
Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.","PURPOSE:
It has been suggested that a lack of good quality sleep might be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleep, are often low in people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, we wanted to know if adding melatonin to their medication would help. We also wondered if these effects were related to whether or not these patients also had sleep disorders.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
We tested the effects of adding prolonged-release melatonin (a slow-release form of the hormone) in 80 patients, roughly half men and half women, with an average age of 75 years. These patients had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and were already receiving standard treatment. Some of these patients also had insomnia. For the first two weeks, we tested these patients with a placebo, then for the next 24 weeks, we gave half of them 2 mg of melatonin each night and the other half the placebo. Following this, we gave all patients the placebo for 2 more weeks. We measured how well these patients were thinking, their sleep quality, daily activities, and how safe this treatment was.

RESULTS:
The patients who received melatonin for 24 weeks generally thought better and slept more efficiently than those who received the placebo. The patients with insomnia who received melatonin saw a significant improvement in how well they could think and how well they slept. This treatment was safe and well-tolerated.

CONCLUSION:
Adding melatonin to Alzheimer's medication has positive results on thinking ability and sleep, especially in patients who also have insomnia. Our findings suggest that bad sleep might lead to a decline in cognitive ability.",What was the age range of the patients?,52-85 years.,Methods,5.5 - Population,,

A population of breast cancer patients exists who, for various reasons, never received adjuvant post-operative tamoxifen (TAM). This study was aimed to evaluate the role of late TAM in these patients.

METHODS.
From 1997 to 2003, patients aged 35 to 75 years, operated more than 2 years previously for monolateral breast cancer without adjuvant TAM, with no signs of metastases and no contraindication to TAM were randomized to TAM 20 mg/day orally for 2 years or follow-up alone. Events were categorized as locoregional relapse, distant metastases, metachronous breast cancer, tumours other than breast cancer and death from any causes, whichever occurred first. The sample size (197 patients per arm, plus 10% allowance) was based on the assumption of a 30% decrease in the number of events occurring at a rate of 5% annually in the 10 years following randomization. Four hundred and thirty-three patients were randomized in the study (TAM 217, follow-up 216). Patients characteristics (TAM/follow-up) included: median age 55/55 years, median time from surgery 25/25 months (range, 25-288/25-294), in situ carcinoma 18/24, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive in 75/68, negative in 70/57, unknown in 72/91 patients. Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 month, mostly because of subjective intolerance. Eighty-three events (TAM 39, follow-up 44) occurred: locoregional relapse in 10/8, distant metastases in 14/16, metachronous breast cancer in 4/10, other tumours in 11/10 patients. Less ER-positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than in follow-up patients (1 vs 10, p = 0.005). Event-free survival was similar in both groups of patients.

CONCLUSIONS.
This 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous ER-positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients. No other statistically significant differences have emerged thus far.","BACKGROUND.
This study looked at breast cancer patients who, for different reasons, didn't receive a common follow-up treatment called Tamoxifen after their surgery. The aim was to see what role, if any, Tamoxifen could still play for these patients if given later.

METHODS.
Between 1997 and 2003, we looked at patients aged 35-75 who had had surgery for one-sided breast cancer more than 2 years before. These patients didn't have any signs of the cancer spreading and were healthy enough to take Tamoxifen. They were split into two groups: one received 20 mg/day of Tamoxifen for two years, and the other did not. We tracked various outcomes including local and distant cancer recurrence, new breast cancers, other types of cancer, and death. We based our sample size on the hypothesis that taking Tamoxifen would result in 30% fewer events occurring over 10 years. The study included 433 people, 217 took Tamoxifen while 216 did not. The patient's characteristics were very similar in both groups.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients stopped taking Tamoxifen after about a month, mainly due to not tolerating it well. Eighty-three significant events occurred: 10 local and 16 distant cancer recurrences, 14 new breast cancers, and 21 other cancers. In the Tamoxifen group, fewer patients developed new estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers (1 vs 10). However, the two groups showed similar overall health progress.

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS::
Recent studies have shown that etomidate is associated with fewer serious adverse events than propofol and has a noninferior sedative effect. We investigated whether etomidate–midazolam is associated with fewer cardiopulmonary adverse events and has noninferior efficacy compared to propofol–midazolam for screening colonoscopy in the elderly.

METHODS.
A prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was performed. Patients aged over 65 years who were scheduled to undergo screening colonoscopy were randomized to receive either etomidate or propofol based on midazolam. The primary outcome was all cardiopulmonary adverse events. The secondary outcomes were vital sign fluctuation (VSF), adverse events disturbing the procedure, and sedation-related outcomes.

RESULTS.
The incidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events was higher in the propofol group (72.6%) than in the etomidate group (54.8%) (P = .040). VSF was detected in 17 (27.4%) and 31 (50.0%) patients in the etomidate and propofol groups, respectively (P = .010). The incidence rate of adverse events disturbing the procedure was significantly higher in the etomidate group (25.8%) than in the propofol group (8.1%) (P = .008). Moreover, the incidence rate of myoclonus was significantly higher in the etomidate group (16.1%) than in the propofol group (1.6%) (P = .004). There was no statistical significance between the 2 groups with respect to sedation times and sedation-related outcomes including patients’ and endoscopist's satisfaction. In the multivariate analysis, the etomidate group had significantly low odds ratio (OR) associated with VSF (OR: 0.407, confidence interval: 0.179–0.926, P = .032).

CONCLUSIONS.
We recommend using etomidate–midazolam in patients with high ASA score or vulnerable to risk factors; propofol–midazolam may be used as a guideline in patients with low ASA score.","ABSTRACT.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS::
Recent research shows that using etomidate for sedation during a colonoscopy could be safer than propofol for older people. Both are comparable in their effectiveness. We studied whether using etomidate with another sedative, midazolam, might lead to fewer heart and lung-related side effects compared to using propofol and midazolam. 

METHODS.
We carried out a clinical trial at a single center. We focused on patients over 65 years old who were due for a routine colonoscopy. These patients were randomly chosen to receive either etomidate or propofol along with midazolam. We mainly wanted to see which group had less heart and lung issues. We also looked at the patient's vital signs, any issues that interfered with the procedure, and the results related to the use of sedatives.

RESULTS.
The number of heart and lung-related issues was higher in the patients who received propofol (72.6%) as compared to those who received etomidate (54.8%). Changes in vital signs were observed in 27.4% of patients receiving etomidate and 50.0% of patients receiving propofol. Procedure-related complications were also significantly higher among patients in the etomidate group (25.8%) compared to the propofol group (8.1%). There were also more cases of muscle twitching observed in the etomidate group (16.1%) compared to the propofol group (1.6%). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of sedation times and how satisfied the patients and doctors were with the sedation process. When it came to changes in vital signs, patients receiving etomidate were much less likely to experience these than those receiving propofol.

CONCLUSIONS.
For patients who are at a high risk of complications or have severe medical conditions, we recommend using etomidate with midazolam. On the other hand, for patients at lower risk, propofol with midazolam could be a better choice.",What type of clinical trial was carried out at a single center?,"A prospective, double-blinded and randomized controlled trial.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the long-acting β2-agonist formoterol in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

METHODS.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study randomized patients ≥ 40 years of age with moderate-to-severe COPD to inhaled formoterol 4.5 or 9 μg twice daily (bid) via Turbuhaler® or placebo for 12 weeks. Salbutamol 100 μg/actuation via pMDI was permitted as reliever medication. The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to treatment period in FEV1 60-min post-dose.

RESULTS.
613 patients received treatment (formoterol 4.5 μg n = 206; 9 μg n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) male; 324 (52.9%) Japanese and 289 (47.1%) European. End of study increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose were significantly greater (p ≺ 0.001 for both) with formoterol 4.5 and 9 μg bid (113% of baseline for both) than with placebo, as were all secondary outcome measures. The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of ≥ 4 was 50.2% for formoterol 4.5 μg (p = 0.0682 vs. placebo), 59.2% (p = 0.0004) for 9 μg, and 41.3% for placebo. Reduction in reliever medication use was significantly greater with formoterol vs. placebo (9 μg: -0.548, p ≺ 0.001; 4.5 μg: -0.274, p = 0.027), with 9 μg being significantly superior to 4.5 μg (-0.274, p = 0.029). Formoterol was well tolerated with the incidence and type of adverse events not being different for the three groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
Formoterol 4.5 μg and 9 μg bid was effective and well tolerated in patients with COPD; there was no difference between formoterol doses for the primary endpoint; however, an added value of formoterol 9 μg over 4.5 μg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.

A study was carried out to see how safe and effective the drug formoterol is for patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard for a person to breathe. 

METHODS.
This tested the drug on patients aged 40 years and over across multiple countries. The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. 

RESULTS.
613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo. They also reduced the reliever medication use a lot more than those taking placebo. The drug formoterol was well accepted and the side effects were not significantly different in any of the groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
The study found that formoterol is effective and safe for COPD patients. Two doses of the drug were tested and although both were helpful, the higher dose seemed to have more benefits for some patients.

Halitosis and foreign body sensation are two common and disturbing symptoms of chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency (TC-RF) tonsil ablation with CO2-laser cryptolysis (CO2-LC) in the treatment of patients with halitosis caused by CCT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Sixty-two patients who suffered from halitosis and/or foreign body sensation due to CCT were enrolled in the present randomized clinical trial, and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A underwent TC-RF tonsil ablation and Group B received CO2-LC. The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. Patient pain levels and amount of bleeding were evaluated as safety outcome measures. Pain levels were evaluated during the intervention, and at Day 1, 3, and 7 following the procedure using a visual analog scale (VAS).

RESULTS.
Mean rank of pain score in the RF tonsil ablation group was found to be higher than in the CO2-LC group at all measured timepoints following the procedure. The amount of bleeding in the LC group was found to be significantly less than in the RF group (P≺0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding duration of procedure (P=0.157).

CONCLUSION.
Both procedures were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of CT-associated halitosis. However, LC showed better results based on lower pain levels, lower incidence of bleeding, and faster progression to a routine diet.","INTRODUCTION.
Bad breath and a sensation of a foreign body are common symptoms of a chronic issue called tonsillitis where there's a cheesy substance in the throat. This study aimed to compare two treatments: one using controlled temperature radio waves and the other using a type of laser, to treat bad breath caused by this condition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
We had 62 people in the study who had bad breath and/or these feelings from their throat issue. They were split into two groups. One group received the treatment with radio waves and the other with the laser. We monitored how severe the symptoms were after a week, a month, and then six months after treatment. We also noted any pain suffered and any bleeding as measures of how safe it was. The pain was measured when the treatment was happening and on days 1, 3, and 7 after the treatment using a rating scale.

RESULTS.
We found that the group treated with radio waves suffered more pain than the laser group at all times we checked after the procedure. The laser group had less bleeding than the radio wave group, a significant difference. However, the time for both procedures to complete wasn't significantly different.

CONCLUSION.
Both treatments were found to be effective and safe for treating chronic tonsillitis-associated bad breath. However, the laser showed better results as it caused less pain, less bleeding, and allowed patients to return to their normal diet sooner.",What rating scale was being used?,"A visual analog scale (VAS), which is a pain rating scales used in clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.",Methods,5.2 - Outcome (Tool),,

Recently, the use of ketamine as a systemic and local analgesic drug in reducing post-operative pain is studied more frequently.

OBJECTIVES.
The aim of the present study was to assess the analgesic efficacy of IV ketamine injection inaddition to nephrostomy tract infiltration of ketamine-bupivacaine on postoperative pain relief after tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Patients (n = 100), with renal stone who were candidates for PCNL were randomized to five groups with 20 cases in each: Group C, 10 mL of saline solution was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group B, 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group BK1, 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group BK2, 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 1.5 mg/kg ketamine was infiltrated into the nephrostomy tract; Group K, 10 mL of saline solution containing 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was intravenously administered. Post-operative pain scores were compared between groups as the primary objective. Comparison of Sedation Scores, rescue analgesic consumption, time to the first rescue analgesics administration, hemodynamic and SpO2 values were regarded as the secondary objective.

RESULTS.
Mean VAS scores in the first 30 min and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 h of post-operative period were significantly lower in groups BK1 and BK2 in comparison with the other groups (P ≺ 0.05). Also, time to first rescue analgesics administration was longer in the same groups (P ≺ 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS.
Infiltration of ketamine plus bupivacaine provides superior analgesic effects in PCNL surgery compared with other methods.","BACKGROUND:
Researchers have been increasingly exploring the use of ketamine - a drug known to relieve pain - for reducing post-surgery discomfort.

OBJECTIVES:
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of injecting ketamine directly into the bloodstream, in addition to combined use with another painkiller called bupivacaine, in subsiding pain after a specific kidney stone removal surgery (tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy).

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
100 patients slated for kidney stone removal were randomly categorized into five groups. Each group received different treatment procedures - some received saline solutions, some received bupivacaine, while others were given varying doses of ketamine or a mix of ketamine and bupivacaine. The main goal was to compare the different groups' pain levels after surgery. Other factors such as the level of consciousness, the use of extra painkillers, timing of additional painkiller use, and their overall vital signs were also inspected.

RESULTS:
Patients that received a combination of bupivacaine and ketamine (both in lower and higher doses) reported lower pain levels within the first half-hour following surgery, and consumed fewer additional painkillers during the first day after surgery, compared to other groups. After surgery, these patients also were granted a longer time before needing extra painkillers.

Induction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.

METHODS.
In a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 ± 2, 50 ± 2 and 40 ± 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.

RESULTS.
BIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
These results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.","BACKGROUND.
Getting the right level of anesthesia for a surgery is very important. For children, the most common method is to have them breathe in the anesthetic. A tube may need to be put down the throat once the child is deeply asleep. It can be hard to tell exactly how deep the sleep is. One way to measure this is using something called a Bispectral index (BIS). In this study, we wanted to see how well the BIS can tell us when a child is asleep enough for the tube to be safely put in.
METHODS.
We did a test with ninety children who were aged 1 to 6 years and were about to have surgery. We started to monitor their BIS and separated them randomly into three groups. The anesthesia was started by gradually increasing the amount of anesthetic in a mix of oxygen and nitrous oxide. We kept increasing until the BIS reached certain target levels. After the tube was put in, we noted how long the process took, whether there were any complications like trouble breathing, if the child moved, and how long they stayed asleep. RESULTS.
The BIS didn't help us to know the best level of anesthesia for putting the tube in. There was no difference in how long it took, whether there were any problems, or how long the children stayed asleep between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS.
Our results showed that there wasn't a significant difference in problems related to putting in the tube at different BIS levels. To make sure the level of anesthesia is deep enough, we might need to aim for lower BIS values.",What does the Bispectral Index (BIS) specifically measure?,The effects of anesthesia on the brain.,Background,4 - New treatment,,

A population of breast cancer patients exists who, for various reasons, never received adjuvant post-operative tamoxifen (TAM). This study was aimed to evaluate the role of late TAM in these patients.

METHODS.
From 1997 to 2003, patients aged 35 to 75 years, operated more than 2 years previously for monolateral breast cancer without adjuvant TAM, with no signs of metastases and no contraindication to TAM were randomized to TAM 20 mg/day orally for 2 years or follow-up alone. Events were categorized as locoregional relapse, distant metastases, metachronous breast cancer, tumours other than breast cancer and death from any causes, whichever occurred first. The sample size (197 patients per arm, plus 10% allowance) was based on the assumption of a 30% decrease in the number of events occurring at a rate of 5% annually in the 10 years following randomization. Four hundred and thirty-three patients were randomized in the study (TAM 217, follow-up 216). Patients characteristics (TAM/follow-up) included: median age 55/55 years, median time from surgery 25/25 months (range, 25-288/25-294), in situ carcinoma 18/24, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive in 75/68, negative in 70/57, unknown in 72/91 patients. Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 month, mostly because of subjective intolerance. Eighty-three events (TAM 39, follow-up 44) occurred: locoregional relapse in 10/8, distant metastases in 14/16, metachronous breast cancer in 4/10, other tumours in 11/10 patients. Less ER-positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than in follow-up patients (1 vs 10, p = 0.005). Event-free survival was similar in both groups of patients.

CONCLUSIONS.
This 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous ER-positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients. No other statistically significant differences have emerged thus far.","BACKGROUND.
This study looked at breast cancer patients who, for different reasons, didn't receive a common follow-up treatment called Tamoxifen after their surgery. The aim was to see what role, if any, Tamoxifen could still play for these patients if given later.

METHODS.
Between 1997 and 2003, we looked at patients aged 35-75 who had had surgery for one-sided breast cancer more than 2 years before. These patients didn't have any signs of the cancer spreading and were healthy enough to take Tamoxifen. They were split into two groups: one received 20 mg/day of Tamoxifen for two years, and the other did not. We tracked various outcomes including local and distant cancer recurrence, new breast cancers, other types of cancer, and death. We based our sample size on the hypothesis that taking Tamoxifen would result in 30% fewer events occurring over 10 years. The study included 433 people, 217 took Tamoxifen while 216 did not. The patient's characteristics were very similar in both groups.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients stopped taking Tamoxifen after about a month, mainly due to not tolerating it well. Eighty-three significant events occurred: 10 local and 16 distant cancer recurrences, 14 new breast cancers, and 21 other cancers. In the Tamoxifen group, fewer patients developed new estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers (1 vs 10). However, the two groups showed similar overall health progress.

To evaluate the effectiveness of lurasidone as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia.

METHOD.
Adults experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia initially received 12–24 weeks of open-label treatment with lurasidone (40–80 mg/d, flexibly dosed). Patients who maintained clinical stability for ⩾12 weeks were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or lurasidone (40–80 mg/d, flexibly dosed) for an additional 28-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to relapse (based on Kaplan–Meier survival analysis).

RESULTS.
A total of 676 patients enrolled in the open-label phase; 285 met protocol-specified stabilization criteria and were randomized to lurasidone (N=144) or placebo (N=141). During the open-label phase, mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score decreased from 90.1 to 54.4 in patients who met clinical stability criteria and were randomized. In the double-blind phase, lurasidone significantly delayed time to relapse compared with placebo (log-rank test, p=0.039), reflecting a 33.7% reduction in risk of relapse (Cox hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.663 (0.447–0.983); p=0.041). Probability of relapse at the double-blind week 28 endpoint (based on Kaplan–Meier analysis) was 42.2% in the lurasidone group and 51.2% in the placebo group. Minimal changes in weight, lipid, glucose, and prolactin were observed throughout the study.

CONCLUSIONS.
This multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study demonstrated the efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia.","GOAL:
We wanted to see how well lurasidone works as a long-term treatment for schizophrenia.

METHOD:
We first gave adults with a severe episode of schizophrenia a 12-24 week treatment with lurasidone. After 12 weeks, those who showed improvement were then divided into two groups. One group continued using lurasidone and the other group was given a placebo (a substance with no medical effect) for an additional 28 weeks. We then checked the time it took before their symptoms came back.

RESULTS:
We had 676 patients in the first phase and 285 showed improvement. These were then divided into the lurasidone (144 patients) and placebo (141 patients) groups. During the first phase, there was a decrease in the severity of symptoms in those who showed improvement. In the next phase, patients using lurasidone took longer before their symptoms came back compared to the placebo group. This was a 33.7% reduction in the risk of symptoms coming back. At the end of the 28 weeks, 42.2% of the lurasidone group and 51.2% of the placebo group had their symptoms return. During the study, the patients only had minor changes in weight, fat levels, sugar levels, and hormone levels.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the long-acting β2-agonist formoterol in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

METHODS.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study randomized patients ≥ 40 years of age with moderate-to-severe COPD to inhaled formoterol 4.5 or 9 μg twice daily (bid) via Turbuhaler® or placebo for 12 weeks. Salbutamol 100 μg/actuation via pMDI was permitted as reliever medication. The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to treatment period in FEV1 60-min post-dose.

RESULTS.
613 patients received treatment (formoterol 4.5 μg n = 206; 9 μg n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) male; 324 (52.9%) Japanese and 289 (47.1%) European. End of study increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose were significantly greater (p ≺ 0.001 for both) with formoterol 4.5 and 9 μg bid (113% of baseline for both) than with placebo, as were all secondary outcome measures. The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of ≥ 4 was 50.2% for formoterol 4.5 μg (p = 0.0682 vs. placebo), 59.2% (p = 0.0004) for 9 μg, and 41.3% for placebo. Reduction in reliever medication use was significantly greater with formoterol vs. placebo (9 μg: -0.548, p ≺ 0.001; 4.5 μg: -0.274, p = 0.027), with 9 μg being significantly superior to 4.5 μg (-0.274, p = 0.029). Formoterol was well tolerated with the incidence and type of adverse events not being different for the three groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
Formoterol 4.5 μg and 9 μg bid was effective and well tolerated in patients with COPD; there was no difference between formoterol doses for the primary endpoint; however, an added value of formoterol 9 μg over 4.5 μg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.

A study was carried out to see how safe and effective the drug formoterol is for patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard for a person to breathe. 

METHODS.
This tested the drug on patients aged 40 years and over across multiple countries. The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. 

RESULTS.
613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo. They also reduced the reliever medication use a lot more than those taking placebo. The drug formoterol was well accepted and the side effects were not significantly different in any of the groups.

To examine the pooled per-protocol ocular end points from two conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) clinical trials of the dual-action antihistamine bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution (BBOS) 1.5%.

METHODS.
Two Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at a total of six separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1.5% (n=78) or placebo (n=79) treatment. Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7 minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20 minutes following each CAC. Secondary ocular end points included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators, and tearing (scored as either absent or present) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects.

RESULTS.
A statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1.5% treatment compared to placebo at all time points (P≺0.0001), while measures for onset and 8-hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, ≥1.0 unit difference) at a majority of time points. In addition, a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia was achieved at a majority of time points during the onset of action CAC test. Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo, most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8-hour study visits. Adverse events were generally mild and transient.

CONCLUSION.
BBOS 1.5% rapidly reduced CAC-induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8 hours after dosing. Certain secondary signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced.","PURPOSE.
The purpose of this study was to assess how effective a new antihistamine eye drop (BBOS 1.5%) is at treating eye allergy symptoms.

METHODS.
The research team conducted two trials with the same design involving 157 participants, either using the antihistamine drop (78 participants) or a placebo (79 participants). The participants were given a drop in both eyes during different visits, either 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours before being exposed to a common eye allergen. The main traits measured were changes in eye itching and redness at various time intervals after the exposure. Other measurements including swelling, tearing, and other forms of redness were also considered.

RESULTS.
The findings showed a significant reduction in eye itching for those using the antihistamine drop compared to those using the placebo.

Intracellular concentrations of adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP) are many times greater than extracellular concentrations (1–10 mM versus 10–100 nM, respectively) and cellular release of ATP is tightly controlled. Transient rises in extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have important signaling roles; and acting through purinergic receptors, can increase blood flow and oxygenation of tissues; and act as neurotransmitters. Increased blood flow not only increases substrate availability but may also aid in recovery through removal of metabolic waste products allowing muscles to accomplish more work with less fatigue. The objective of the present study was to determine if supplemental ATP would improve muscle torque, power, work, or fatigue during repeated bouts of high intensity resistance exercise.

METHODS.
Sixteen participants (8 male and 8 female; ages: 21–34 years) were enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study using a crossover design. The participants received either supplemental ATP (400 mg/d divided into 2 daily doses) or placebo for 15 d. After an overnight fast, participants underwent strength and fatigue testing, consisting of 3 sets of 50 maximal knee extensions performed on a Biodex® leg dynamometer.

RESULTS.
No differences were detected in high peak torque, power, or total work with ATP supplementation; however, low peak torque in set 2 was significantly improved (p ≺ 0.01). Additionally, in set 3, a trend was detected for less torque fatigue with ATP supplementation (p ≺ 0.10).

CONCLUSIONS.
Supplementation with 400 mg ATP/d for 15 days tended to reduce muscle fatigue and improved a participant’s ability to maintain a higher force output at the end of an exhaustive exercise bout.","BACKGROUND.
The body has a compound called adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP), which is mostly found inside our cells and plays a significant role in energy supply. Brief increases in this compound level outside the cells can be useful as it helps improve blood flow and oxygen supply to tissues. It can also act as a neurotransmitter to help nerves communicate with each other. Better blood flow can assist in our body's recovery after activity by removing waste products from metabolism. It may also empower muscles to do more work without tiring. This study aims to determine if taking extra ATP can enhance muscle power and reduce fatigue during intense workouts.

METHODS.
We included sixteen people (8 men and 8 women; aged between 21-34 years) in a tightly controlled study that neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was getting the ATP supplements or a placebo. The participants were given either ATP supplements (400mg/day divided into two daily doses) or placebo for 15 days. After fasting overnight, the participants were made to do strength and fatigue tests, involving three sets of 50 maximum knee extensions executed on a machine called a Biodex® leg dynamometer.

RESULTS.

Flu-like symptoms (FLS) are common side effects of interferon beta (IFN-β) treatment in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) and are associated with post-injection cytokine surge. We hypothesized that vitamin D3 supplementation would ameliorate FLS by decreasing related serum cytokines’ levels.

METHODS.
In a randomized, double blind study of 45 IFNβ-treated PwMS, 21 patients were assigned to 800 IU of vitamin D3 per day (low dose), while 24 patients received 4,370 IU per day (high dose) for one year. FLS were assessed monthly by telephonic interviews. Serum levels of 25-hydroxy-D (25-OH-D), calcium, PTH, IL-17, IL-10 and IFN-γ were measured periodically. EDSS, relapses, adverse events and quality of life (QoL) were documented.

RESULTS.
25-OH-D levels increased to a significantly higher levels and PTH levels decreased in the high dose group. There was no significant change in FLS. IL-17 levels were significantly increased in the low dose group, while patients receiving high dose vitamin D had a heterogeneous IL-17 response. No significant differences in relapse rate, EDSS, QoL, serum IL-10 and IFNγ were found. Hypercalcemia or other potential major adverse events were not observed.

CONCLUSION.
Vitamin D supplementation to IFN−β treated PwMS, at the doses used, seems safe and associated with dose-dependent changes in IL-17 serum levels, while not affecting IFN−β related FLS.

ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01005095","BACKGROUND.
People with Multiple Sclerosis often get flu-like symptoms when receiving a treatment called interferon beta (IFN-β). There seems to be a link with a spike in certain proteins (cytokines) in the blood after the injection. We think taking Vitamin D3 might help reduce these flu-like symptoms by lowering the levels of these proteins in the blood.

METHODS.
We ran a study with 45 people who were being treated for their Multiple Sclerosis with IFN-β. Half of them were given a small dose of Vitamin D3 each day and the other half were given a larger dose, every day for a year. We checked in with them regularly via phone to see if they were having flu-like symptoms. We also checked certain things in their blood and noted any relapses or changes in the quality of their life.

RESULTS.
People who took the higher dose of Vitamin D3 had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood and lower levels of a certain hormone. However, we didn't see any major change in their flu-like symptoms. In the low dose group, levels of a certain protein (IL-17) rose significantly. No major changes were found in other factors we were monitoring, such as relapse rate and quality of life. We also didn't observe any serious side effects from the vitamin D supplementation.

CONCLUSION.
It seems safe for people receiving IFN-β treatment for their Multiple Sclerosis to take Vitamin D supplements. The dose does measurably impact levels of the protein IL-17, but it doesn't seem to affect the flu-like symptoms related to the IFN-β treatment.

The new device, the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, utilizes a battery-powered drill to insert the needle. Fifty-four bone marrows (27 standard and 27 OBM) were performed by 11 fellows under the observation and supervision of 3 attending hematologists and 1 research technologist. The primary endpoint of the study, the mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens, a surrogate for marrow quality, was determined by a pathologist in a blinded manner. The mean length of the marrow biopsy specimens was significantly longer (56%) for the OBM group (15.3 mm) than for the standard bone marrow (SBM) group (9.8 mm), P≺0.003. An objectively determined secondary endpoint; mean procedure time, skin-to-skin; also favored the OBM group (175 s) versus the SBM group (292 s), P≺0.007. Several subjective secondary endpoints also favored the OBM group. Only minor adverse events were encountered in the OBM and SBM study groups. It was concluded that bone marrow procedures (BMPs) performed by hematologists-in-training were significantly faster and superior in quality when performed with the OBM compared to the SBM. These data suggest that the OBM may be considered a new standard of care for adult hematology patients.

The study took place in a teaching hospital, with medical trainees overseen by experienced doctors and a research technician. The new device, called the OnControl Bone Marrow (OBM) Biopsy System, is powered by a battery-operated drill to insert its needle.

The research carried out 54 bone marrow tests, half done with the standard needle and half done with the new OnControl device. The main goal measured was the average length of the bone marrow samples taken out, as longer samples usually mean better quality. The ones taken out by the OnControl device were, on average, over half as long again as the ones taken out with the regular needle.

The researchers also timed the procedures and found that the OnControl device completed its tests significantly faster than the regular needle did. Other measures also favored the OnControl device. There were only a few minor problems in both groups of tests.

Therefore, the researchers concluded that bone marrow tests carried out by doctors-in-training are faster and provide better results when the OnControl device is used compared to the regular needle. Consequently, this device could be favored as a new norm for adult patients needing hematology, and it is a better tool for teaching medical trainees in hematology.",What type of trainees were present in the teaching hospital?,Hematologists (those who study the blood).,n/a (Unsectioned),2 - Goal,,

Halitosis and foreign body sensation are two common and disturbing symptoms of chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency (TC-RF) tonsil ablation with CO2-laser cryptolysis (CO2-LC) in the treatment of patients with halitosis caused by CCT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Sixty-two patients who suffered from halitosis and/or foreign body sensation due to CCT were enrolled in the present randomized clinical trial, and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A underwent TC-RF tonsil ablation and Group B received CO2-LC. The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. Patient pain levels and amount of bleeding were evaluated as safety outcome measures. Pain levels were evaluated during the intervention, and at Day 1, 3, and 7 following the procedure using a visual analog scale (VAS).

RESULTS.
Mean rank of pain score in the RF tonsil ablation group was found to be higher than in the CO2-LC group at all measured timepoints following the procedure. The amount of bleeding in the LC group was found to be significantly less than in the RF group (P≺0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding duration of procedure (P=0.157).

CONCLUSION.
Both procedures were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of CT-associated halitosis. However, LC showed better results based on lower pain levels, lower incidence of bleeding, and faster progression to a routine diet.","INTRODUCTION.
Bad breath and a sensation of a foreign body are common symptoms of a chronic issue called tonsillitis where there's a cheesy substance in the throat. This study aimed to compare two treatments: one using controlled temperature radio waves and the other using a type of laser, to treat bad breath caused by this condition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
We had 62 people in the study who had bad breath and/or these feelings from their throat issue. They were split into two groups. One group received the treatment with radio waves and the other with the laser. We monitored how severe the symptoms were after a week, a month, and then six months after treatment. We also noted any pain suffered and any bleeding as measures of how safe it was. The pain was measured when the treatment was happening and on days 1, 3, and 7 after the treatment using a rating scale.

RESULTS.
We found that the group treated with radio waves suffered more pain than the laser group at all times we checked after the procedure. The laser group had less bleeding than the radio wave group, a significant difference. However, the time for both procedures to complete wasn't significantly different.

 To determine the effects of probiotic yogurt on performance and health status of young adultfemale endurance swimmers.

METHODS.
 In a randomized controlled trial, 46 endurance swimmers girls with mean age of 13.8 ±1.8 years,weight of 48.6±7.5kg and height of 159±5.6cm, were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups,receiving either 400 ml probiotic yogurt (intervention group) or ordinary yogurt (control group) daily for 8weeks. At the beginning and at the end of the study, the 400-m free swimming record was done and the HarvardStep test was employed to measure VO2max. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS software.This trial has been registered with IRCT ID of IRCT2012122311849N1.

RESULTS.
 Average changes in the records of the intervention and control groups were 3.9 and 0.5 seconds, respectively(p= 0.22). The intervention group complained of dyspnea for 2.4 days and the value for the controlwas 4.4 days (p=0.024). Values for ear pain were 0.5 and 1.6 days (p=0.008) respectively. The average numberof episodes of respiratory infection in the intervention group was 0.9 day, which was statistically fewer than thatin the control group (1.4 days), P=0.009.

CONCLUSIONS.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the long-acting β2-agonist formoterol in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

METHODS.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study randomized patients ≥ 40 years of age with moderate-to-severe COPD to inhaled formoterol 4.5 or 9 μg twice daily (bid) via Turbuhaler® or placebo for 12 weeks. Salbutamol 100 μg/actuation via pMDI was permitted as reliever medication. The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to treatment period in FEV1 60-min post-dose.

RESULTS.
613 patients received treatment (formoterol 4.5 μg n = 206; 9 μg n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) male; 324 (52.9%) Japanese and 289 (47.1%) European. End of study increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose were significantly greater (p ≺ 0.001 for both) with formoterol 4.5 and 9 μg bid (113% of baseline for both) than with placebo, as were all secondary outcome measures. The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of ≥ 4 was 50.2% for formoterol 4.5 μg (p = 0.0682 vs. placebo), 59.2% (p = 0.0004) for 9 μg, and 41.3% for placebo. Reduction in reliever medication use was significantly greater with formoterol vs. placebo (9 μg: -0.548, p ≺ 0.001; 4.5 μg: -0.274, p = 0.027), with 9 μg being significantly superior to 4.5 μg (-0.274, p = 0.029). Formoterol was well tolerated with the incidence and type of adverse events not being different for the three groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
Formoterol 4.5 μg and 9 μg bid was effective and well tolerated in patients with COPD; there was no difference between formoterol doses for the primary endpoint; however, an added value of formoterol 9 μg over 4.5 μg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.

A study was carried out to see how safe and effective the drug formoterol is for patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard for a person to breathe. 

METHODS.
This tested the drug on patients aged 40 years and over across multiple countries. The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. 

RESULTS.
613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo. They also reduced the reliever medication use a lot more than those taking placebo. The drug formoterol was well accepted and the side effects were not significantly different in any of the groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
The study found that formoterol is effective and safe for COPD patients. Two doses of the drug were tested and although both were helpful, the higher dose seemed to have more benefits for some patients.

A population of breast cancer patients exists who, for various reasons, never received adjuvant post-operative tamoxifen (TAM). This study was aimed to evaluate the role of late TAM in these patients.

METHODS.
From 1997 to 2003, patients aged 35 to 75 years, operated more than 2 years previously for monolateral breast cancer without adjuvant TAM, with no signs of metastases and no contraindication to TAM were randomized to TAM 20 mg/day orally for 2 years or follow-up alone. Events were categorized as locoregional relapse, distant metastases, metachronous breast cancer, tumours other than breast cancer and death from any causes, whichever occurred first. The sample size (197 patients per arm, plus 10% allowance) was based on the assumption of a 30% decrease in the number of events occurring at a rate of 5% annually in the 10 years following randomization. Four hundred and thirty-three patients were randomized in the study (TAM 217, follow-up 216). Patients characteristics (TAM/follow-up) included: median age 55/55 years, median time from surgery 25/25 months (range, 25-288/25-294), in situ carcinoma 18/24, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive in 75/68, negative in 70/57, unknown in 72/91 patients. Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 month, mostly because of subjective intolerance. Eighty-three events (TAM 39, follow-up 44) occurred: locoregional relapse in 10/8, distant metastases in 14/16, metachronous breast cancer in 4/10, other tumours in 11/10 patients. Less ER-positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than in follow-up patients (1 vs 10, p = 0.005). Event-free survival was similar in both groups of patients.

CONCLUSIONS.
This 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous ER-positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients. No other statistically significant differences have emerged thus far.","BACKGROUND.
This study looked at breast cancer patients who, for different reasons, didn't receive a common follow-up treatment called Tamoxifen after their surgery. The aim was to see what role, if any, Tamoxifen could still play for these patients if given later.

METHODS.
Between 1997 and 2003, we looked at patients aged 35-75 who had had surgery for one-sided breast cancer more than 2 years before. These patients didn't have any signs of the cancer spreading and were healthy enough to take Tamoxifen. They were split into two groups: one received 20 mg/day of Tamoxifen for two years, and the other did not. We tracked various outcomes including local and distant cancer recurrence, new breast cancers, other types of cancer, and death. We based our sample size on the hypothesis that taking Tamoxifen would result in 30% fewer events occurring over 10 years. The study included 433 people, 217 took Tamoxifen while 216 did not. The patient's characteristics were very similar in both groups.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients stopped taking Tamoxifen after about a month, mainly due to not tolerating it well. Eighty-three significant events occurred: 10 local and 16 distant cancer recurrences, 14 new breast cancers, and 21 other cancers. In the Tamoxifen group, fewer patients developed new estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers (1 vs 10). However, the two groups showed similar overall health progress.

Many drug users present to primary care requesting detoxification from illicit opiates. There are a number of detoxification agents but no recommended drug of choice. The purpose of this study is to compare buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for detoxification from illicit opiates in primary care.

METHODS.
Open label randomised controlled trial in NHS Primary Care (General Practices), Leeds, UK. Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six months post detoxification were recorded.

RESULTS.
Only 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Risk of non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35–0.96, p = 0.065). A higher proportion of people allocated to buprenorphine provided a clean urine sample compared with those who received dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33–3.21, p = 0.028). People allocated to buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and more were abstinent at three months (10 vs 4, RR 1.55 CI 0.96–2.52) and six months post detoxification (7 vs 3, RR 1.45 CI 0.84–2.49).

CONCLUSION.
Informative randomised trials evaluating routine care within the primary care setting are possible amongst drug using populations. This small study generates unique data on commonly used treatment regimens.","BACKGROUND:
Many drug users go to their regular doctors asking for help to stop using illegal drugs. There are many medicines available to help with this, but no one is sure which is the best. This study compares two drugs, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which is better at helping people stop using illegal drugs.

METHODS:
This study included 60 adults in Leeds, UK, who were using illegal drugs and wanted to stop. They were randomly chosen to receive either buprenorphine or dihydrocodeine. The way the drugs were reduced over time depended on what the prescribing doctor thought was best, but it was not supposed to be more than 15 days. The main goal was to see if the person stopped using illegal drugs by the end of the treatment, which was checked by a urine test. They also looked at what happened during the treatment and three and six months afterwards.

RESULTS:
Only 23% of the people finished their drug detox treatment and gave a urine sample at the end. If people were given buprenorphine, they were more likely to finish the detox treatment. Those given buprenorphine were also more likely to have a clean urine sample, meaning they stopped using illegal drugs. They also needed to see healthcare professionals less often during treatment and more were still not using drugs three and six months later.

Several studies have shown that maximizing stroke volume (or increasing it until a plateau is reached) by volume loading during high-risk surgery may improve post-operative outcome. This goal could be achieved simply by minimizing the variation in arterial pulse pressure (ΔPP) induced by mechanical ventilation. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized, single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the length of postoperative stay in hospital.

METHODS.
Thirty-three patients undergoing high-risk surgery were randomized either to a control group (group C, n = 16) or to an intervention group (group I, n = 17). In group I, ΔPP was continuously monitored during surgery by a multiparameter bedside monitor and minimized to 10% or less by volume loading.

RESULTS.
Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiology score, type, and duration of surgery. During surgery, group I received more fluid than group C (4,618 ± 1,557 versus 1,694 ± 705 ml (mean ± SD), P ≺ 0.0001), and ΔPP decreased from 22 ± 75 to 9 ± 1% (P ≺ 0.05) in group I. The median duration of postoperative stay in hospital (7 versus 17 days, P ≺ 0.01) was lower in group I than in group C. The number of postoperative complications per patient (1.4 ± 2.1 versus 3.9 ± 2.8, P ≺ 0.05), as well as the median duration of mechanical ventilation (1 versus 5 days, P ≺ 0.05) and stay in the intensive care unit (3 versus 9 days, P ≺ 0.01) was also lower in group I.

CONCLUSION.
Monitoring and minimizing ΔPP by volume loading during high-risk surgery improves postoperative outcome and decreases the length of stay in hospital.

NCT00479011","INTRODUCTION.
Research has shown that maintaining a healthy blood flow during major surgeries can help to improve recovery after the operation. One way to achieve this is by using a ventilator to regulate the pressure changes in the blood vessels during these operations. Our research aimed to find out if this method could shorten the length of a patient's stay in the hospital after surgery.

METHODS.
We did a study that involved 33 patients who were due for major surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group, made up of 16 patients, was treated normally and served as our basis for comparison. In the second group of 17 patients, we kept track of their blood pressure changes using a special monitor during surgery, and ensured that these changes remained small by giving them a lot of fluids.

RESULTS.
The two patient groups were similar in their demographic data, overall health condition, type of surgery, and surgery duration. Throughout the surgery, we noticed that the second group received more fluid and experienced a decline in their blood pressure changes. Also, this group generally spent less time in the hospital after surgery (7 days instead of 17). They also had fewer complications, spent less time on ventilators (1 day instead of 5), and stayed in the ICU for a shorter period (3 days instead of 9). 

CONCLUSION.
Our findings suggest that if we carefully monitor and control blood pressure changes by giving plenty of fluids during major surgery, it can improve the recovery outcomes. This includes reducing the number of complications, the length of time on a ventilator, and the duration of the hospital and ICU stay.

End of study increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose were significantly greater (p ≺ 0.001 for both) with formoterol 4.5 and 9 μg bid (113% of baseline for both) than with placebo, as were all secondary outcome measures. The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of ≥ 4 was 50.2% for formoterol 4.5 μg (p = 0.0682 vs. placebo), 59.2% (p = 0.0004) for 9 μg, and 41.3% for placebo. Reduction in reliever medication use was significantly greater with formoterol vs. placebo (9 μg: -0.548, p ≺ 0.001; 4.5 μg: -0.274, p = 0.027), with 9 μg being significantly superior to 4.5 μg (-0.274, p = 0.029). Formoterol was well tolerated with the incidence and type of adverse events not being different for the three groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
Formoterol 4.5 μg and 9 μg bid was effective and well tolerated in patients with COPD; there was no difference between formoterol doses for the primary endpoint; however, an added value of formoterol 9 μg over 4.5 μg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.

NCT00628862 (ClinicalTrials.gov); D5122C00001 (AstraZeneca Study code).","BACKGROUND.
A study was carried out to see how safe and effective the drug formoterol is for patients with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a lung disease that makes it hard for a person to breathe. 

METHODS.
This tested the drug on patients aged 40 years and over across multiple countries. The patients took either formoterol or a placebo twice a day using an inhaler, over 12 weeks. They also used a common asthma drug called Salbutamol for relief if they needed it. The test's objective was to see if there were changes in patients' ability to breathe in the hour after they took the drug. 

RESULTS.
613 patients took part in the trial: just under half were from Japan, just over half were from Europe and the majority were male. At the end of the study, those who were given formoterol showed a significant improvement in their breathing ability. It was more noticeable than those given the placebo. They also reduced the reliever medication use a lot more than those taking placebo. The drug formoterol was well accepted and the side effects were not significantly different in any of the groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
The study found that formoterol is effective and safe for COPD patients. Two doses of the drug were tested and although both were helpful, the higher dose seemed to have more benefits for some patients.

It is unclear if objective selection of employees, for an intervention to prevent sickness absence, is more effective than subjective 'personal enlistment'. We hypothesize that objectively selected employees are 'at risk' for sickness absence and eligible to participate in the intervention program.

METHODS.
The dispatch of 8603 screening instruments forms the starting point of the objective selection process. Different stages of this process, throughout which employees either dropped out or were excluded, were described and compared with the subjective selection process. Characteristics of ineligible and ultimately selected employees, for a randomized trial, were described and quantified using sickness absence data.

RESULTS.
Overall response rate on the screening instrument was 42.0%. Response bias was found for the parameters sex and age, but not for sickness absence. Sickness absence was higher in the 'at risk' (N = 212) group (42%) compared to the 'not at risk' (N = 2503) group (25%) (OR 2.17 CI 1.63–2.89; p = 0.000). The selection process ended with the successful inclusion of 151 eligible, i.e. 2% of the approached employees in the trial.

CONCLUSION.
The study shows that objective selection of employees for early intervention is effective. Despite methodological and practical problems, selected employees are actually those at risk for sickness absence, who will probably benefit more from the intervention program than others.","BACKGROUND.
This study looks at if picking workers based on certain facts (objective) for a program meant to stop them from taking sick days is better than just choosing them based on a hunch (subjective). The researchers think that those chosen based on solid evidence are more likely to be at risk of taking sick days, making them the ideal candidates for the program.

METHODS.
The researchers started by sending out 8603 surveys to begin the evidence-based selection process. They detailed and compared the different steps in this process, which involved some workers not completing the process or being ruled out, to the hunch-based selection. They studied and noted down certain characteristics of the workers who couldn't join and those who were eventually chosen for a test experiment using data regarding sick leave.

RESULTS.
The overall response to the survey was 42.0%. There was bias in answering the survey when it came to sex and age, but not for sick leave. The rate of sick leave was higher in the 'at risk' group (42%) as compared to the 'not at risk' group (25%). The selection process ended successfully with 151 workers, or 2% of those contacted, included in the test.

CONCLUSION.
The study found that selecting workers for this kind of program based on solid evidence is effective. Even though they faced some challenges, the researchers were able to find that the workers picked were genuinely those at risk of taking sick leave.

Administration of normal saline might increase circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may cause variation of plasmatic electrolytic and hyperchloremic acidosis, which in turn can impair renal function. Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures, the plasmatic electrolyte concentration, the acid–base equilibrium, and the renal function.

METHODS.
This is a double blind randomized trial. Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (bowel cancer) were allocated in two groups, the balanced solution (BS) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids); and the unbalanced solution (UBS) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions (colloids and crystalloids). Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), within 2 h after surgery (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T3). The following data were collected: 1) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10; 2) blood gases variables; 3) electrolytes, albumin, total serum protein and the strong ion difference; 4) neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from urinary sample.

RESULTS.
The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9. The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid–base equilibrium and higher level of NGAL.

CONCLUSIONS.
The use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes, acid–base equilibrium, kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.

ClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT01320891).","BACKGROUND.
This experiment aims to study the effects of two different types of intravenous fluids used during surgery – ‘balanced’ and ‘unbalanced’. There are concerns that the traditional 'unbalanced' fluid could lead to inflammation, change of blood electrolyte levels, acidity issues, and potentially harm the kidneys. 'Balanced' fluids may reduce these impacts.

METHODS.
The experiment is conducted in a double-blind format, meaning neither the patients nor the doctors knew which fluid was being used. The study included 40 patients undergoing major bowel cancer surgery. They were divided into two groups. One group received 'balanced' fluids, and the other received 'unbalanced' fluids. Measurements of several variables were taken at four different time points during and after surgery.

RESULTS.
The group that received 'balanced' fluids had higher levels of certain proteins that are linked to lower inflammation and lower levels of a protein that can indicate tissue damage. The group receiving 'unbalanced' fluids had issues with chloride, calcium, and magnesium levels, more acid-base imbalance, and higher levels of a marker for kidney damage.

CONCLUSIONS.
Using 'balanced' fluids during surgery caused less upset in the body's blood chemicals and acid-base balance and was kinder to kidney function. It might also start an early anti-inflammatory response.

The group that used only remifentanil had higher blood flow changes and stress hormone levels three hours post surgery compared to the other groups. Even though patients in this group woke up and had their breathing tubes removed sooner after surgery, they also reported higher levels of restlessness and pain.

A link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently been suggested. Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52–85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale–Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.

RESULTS.
Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI ≥6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus −3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (−3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.

CONCLUSION.
Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.","PURPOSE:
It has been suggested that a lack of good quality sleep might be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleep, are often low in people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, we wanted to know if adding melatonin to their medication would help. We also wondered if these effects were related to whether or not these patients also had sleep disorders.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
We tested the effects of adding prolonged-release melatonin (a slow-release form of the hormone) in 80 patients, roughly half men and half women, with an average age of 75 years. These patients had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and were already receiving standard treatment. Some of these patients also had insomnia. For the first two weeks, we tested these patients with a placebo, then for the next 24 weeks, we gave half of them 2 mg of melatonin each night and the other half the placebo. Following this, we gave all patients the placebo for 2 more weeks. We measured how well these patients were thinking, their sleep quality, daily activities, and how safe this treatment was.

RESULTS:
The patients who received melatonin for 24 weeks generally thought better and slept more efficiently than those who received the placebo. The patients with insomnia who received melatonin saw a significant improvement in how well they could think and how well they slept. This treatment was safe and well-tolerated.

CONCLUSION:
Adding melatonin to Alzheimer's medication has positive results on thinking ability and sleep, especially in patients who also have insomnia. Our findings suggest that bad sleep might lead to a decline in cognitive ability.",What were the effects of melatonin over time?,Improvements in cognition (brain function) and sleep/sleep quality were greater in the group receiving melatonin the longer the treatment went on.,Results,6 - Results,,

During early development cellular activity may be sensitive to micronutrient deficiencies, however the evidence from human studies is equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term cognitive and social-emotional effects of multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron supplementation alone, administered during infancy. This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (RCT) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6–17 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (MMN) including zinc (451 in each group). The supplementation period for both groups was six months. In 2012, a subsample of 184 children from the original cohort (now aged 36–48 months) was randomly selected to participate in a follow-up trial and was assessed for intelligence, working memory, inhibition, and executive function. The tests showed no significant differences between the supplementation groups though there were some gender differences, with girls displaying higher scores than boys across both groups on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) Verbal IQ sentences subtest, the Day-Night cognitive test and on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) social competency, and boys scoring higher than girls in problem behaviour. The results indicate that MMN supplementation had no long term additional effects on cognitive function compared with iron supplementation alone.

The researchers wanted to find out how supplements of various nutrients given in early life might impact a child's long-term mental and emotional development. 

In 2010, they gave daily supplements to 902 babies from Lima, Peru. Half of them got a supplement that was just iron, while the other half got a supplement that included iron plus some other nutrients, like zinc. They did this for six months.

Two years later, they got a random group of 184 kids from the original set to take part in another round of tests. They tested their intelligence, memory, and other brain functions, as well as their social-emotional skills. 

The results showed that the type of supplement they had as babies didn't make a difference in these areas. However, there was a noticeable difference between boys and girls. For example, girls generally had higher scores in verbal intelligence and social skills, while boys had higher scores in problem behaviour. 

These findings mean that giving extra nutrients beyond iron did not make a difference to these children's cognitive function in the long term.

Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) uses feedback from brain signals to guide stimulation. A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.

METHODS.
We applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of β activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0±0.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.

RESULTS.
UPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS.

CONCLUSION.
Bilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states.","INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.
This research is about a deep brain stimulation method, known as adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), where we use feedback from the brain to guide the process. From previous trials, we saw that aDBS had a strong positive impact on people with Parkinson's disease. Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.

METHODS.
We used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.

RESULTS. 
The treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.

Since the macular pigment is of dietary origin, supplements containing the relevant carotenoids are readily available. In this study, we compared the changes in macular pigment over a 24-week supplementation period for two groups of 24 subjects each assigned to either of two supplement formulations, 20 mg/day of lutein or 20 mg equivalent free carotenoids of a combination of diacetate esters of the macular carotenoids. The latter group responded with a larger increase (0.0666 ± 0.0481) in macular pigment optical density than the former group (0.0398 ± 0.0430), driven largely by the older subjects. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.0287). There was a general trend towards smaller increases in macular pigment for those subjects whose baseline value was high. However, the trend was only significant (p ≺ 0.05) for subjects in the diacetate group. No differences in response could be attributed to the gender of the subjects.

The aim of our study was to research the effects of levosimendan (LS) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) combination on systolic and diastolic ventricular function after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who required endoventricular patch repair (EVPR).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
We studied 70 patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. LS and SNP combination was administered in 35 patients (study group, SG). In the remaining patients, normal saline solution was given (placebo group, PG). Levosimendan (10μgr/kg) started 4 h prior to operation and we stopped LS before the initiation of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). During the rewarming period, we started again levosimendan (10μgr/kg) in combination with SNP (0.1-0.2 μgr/kg/min). If mean blood pressure decreased by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values, for corrected of mean arterial pressure, the volume loading was performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate. Hemodynamic variables, inotrophyc requirement, and laboratory values were recorded.

RESULTS.
Five patients died (7.14%) post-surgery (one from SG and 4 from PG) due to low cardiac out-put syndrome (LOS). At the postoperative period, cardiac output and stroke volume index was higher in SG (mean±sd;29.1±6.3 vs. 18.4±4.9 mL/min−1/m−2 (P≺0.0001)). Stroke volume index (SVI) decreased from 29±10mL/m2 preoperatively to 22±14mL/m2 in the early postoperative period in group 1. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.002). Cardiac index was higher in SG (320.7±37.5 vs. 283.0±83.9 mL/min−1/m−2 (P=0.009)). The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6±2.7 vs. 10.4±2.0 mg/kg, P≺ 0.008), and postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P≺ 0.01). Ten patients (28.5%) in SG and 21 patients (60%) in PG required inotrophyc support (P≺0.001). We used IABP in eight patients (22.8%) in SG and 17 patients (48.5%) in CG (P=0.0001).

This study showed that LS and SNP combination impressive increase in left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions including LVEF. The use of this combination achieved more less inotrophics and IABP requirement. We therefore suggest preoperative and peroperative levosimendan and SNP combination.","GOAL:
Our study wanted to see how the combination of two drugs, levosimendan (LS) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), impacts the heart's ability to pump during and after heart bypass surgery in people who also needed another procedure to fix the inside wall of the heart.

HOW WE DID IT:
We had 70 heart disease patients with a type of heart damage that causes it to enlarge. We gave half the patients the drug combination and the other half a harmless salt solution (as a comparison group). The levosimendan was started 4 hours before surgery and stopped before the start of the heart bypass; during the last part of surgery, levosimendan was restarted along with SNP. If a patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during this process, a volume increasing solution was given to correct it. We recorded many patients' blood measurements, their need for heart-strengthening drugs, and laboratory test results.

WHAT WE FOUND:
After surgery, 5 patients died due to heart complications (one from the drug group and four from the comparison group). Patients given the drugs had stronger heart function stats compared to those who weren't. These patients also needed less supportive drugs and less interventional equipment post-surgery. Various measurements like cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac index were better in the drug group. Also, fewer people in the drug group needed help from heart-strengthening drugs or equipment post-surgery.

CONCLUSION:
The study shows that the LS and SNP combination really improved heart function during and after surgery. Using these drugs led to less need for other supporting drugs or equipment.

Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g · kg−1 · d−1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g · kg−1 · d−1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children ≺24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol · kg−1 · min−1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (−0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (−0.20 to 0.63) μmol · kg−1 · min−1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

This is because having surgery and using a heart-lung machine during the operation might break down protein faster than normal, and these babies might not eat enough to replace it. This study was done to see how giving these babies more protein after surgery would affect their protein levels.

METHODS.
We conducted a study where we randomly chose some babies to get a lot of protein and some to get a normal amount. This was done on the second day after they had surgery to fix heart defects they were born with. We did a special test to measure how much of a kind of protein called ""valine"" their bodies were making. We also measured how much of another protein called ""albumin"" their bodies were making. We then compared the results between the two groups.

RESULTS.
28 babies, who were around 9 months old and weighed about 7 kg, took part in the study. However, we could only use the data from 20 of them for our final results. Because we didn't have enough data, we couldn't make conclusions about protein levels. There was no difference in albumin production between the two groups. However, we saw that the babies getting a lot of protein had higher levels of valine and another substance called BUN, which is an indicator of how much protein a person is getting.

CONCLUSIONS.
It looks like the extra protein in the diet of the high-protein group might have increased the levels of valine and BUN. However, because we didn't have enough data, we can't say for sure that a high-protein diet would change protein levels in these babies. Therefore, the results from our study should be taken as a starting point for further research.

Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain is a prevalent, underdiagnosed cause of lower back pain. SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.

METHODS.
We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.

RESULTS.
Subjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority ≻0.999). Clinically important (≥15 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 27.3% of NSM subjects. At six months, quality of life improved more in the surgery group and satisfaction rates were high. The mean number of adverse events in the first six months was slightly higher in the surgical group compared to the non-surgical group (1.3 vs. 1.0 events per subject, p=0.1857).

CONCLUSIONS.
Six-month follow-up from this level 1 study showed that minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving function and improving quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE.
Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is an acceptable option for patients with chronic SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroiliac joint disruptions unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.","BACKGROUND.
Lower back pain is often caused by a problem in the area where your spine connects to your hips, called the sacroiliac joint. Sometimes, this pain can be treated by using surgery to fuse or join together parts of this joint. However, we don't have any studies yet that have compared how patients do with this surgery versus without it.

METHODS.
We set up a study with 148 patients who had problems with their sacroiliac joint. We randomly picked some to get a special kind of low-impact surgery (102 people), while others (46 people) were treated without surgery. We measured how much pain and disability our patients were feeling when the study started. Then, we checked on them 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to see if there was an improvement. 

RESULTS.
Our patients, most of whom were women and averaged 51 years of age, were having a lot of trouble with pain and disability at the start of the study. We were able to follow up with almost all of them at the six-month mark. By then, about 81.4% of the surgery patients were doing significantly better, compared to 23.9% of the non-surgery group. Also, 75% of the surgery group showed great improvement in how they were able to move around and do daily activities versus 27.3% in the non-surgery group. Finally, the surgery patients generally felt happier and more satisfied. 
However, it's worth mentioning that slightly more surgery patients experienced complications or side effects than non-surgery patients.

CONCLUSIONS.
After six months, the results of our high-level study show that the low-impact surgery is much more effective than non-surgery treatment in reducing pain, improving motion, and increasing the happiness of patients who have problems with their sacroiliac joint.

However, there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection. We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile, oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption. A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups: 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection (group A); 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection (group B); and 30 control subjects (group C). The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable. Comparing the BMIs among the three groups, the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant (F=3.921, P≺0.05). Compared with group C, the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher (P≺0.001 and P≺0.01, respectively); however, the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant (P≻0.05). Additionally, no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups (all P≻0.05). The serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (serum IL-10: P≺0.05; E-selectin: P≺0.05). The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C (P≺0.01); the serum E-selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C (P≻0.05). Furthermore, the serum IL-10 and E-selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C (serum IL-10: P≺0.001; E-selectin: P≺0.05); however, the serum TNF-α levels did not differ among groups (all P≻0.05). Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C, there were no significant differences among groups (all P≻0.05). In conclusion, we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion. Moreover, chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect, but there was no association between H. pylori infection, chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance.","We wanted to understand how long-term alcohol intake relates to a specific stomach infection caused by a bacteria called H. pylori. We studied various body responses and inflammation markers in three groups of people, totaling 142 subjects in all. Group A consisted of 59 people who drink alcohol regularly and have the H. pylori infection. Group B had 53 subjects who drink alcohol regularly but do not have the infection. Finally, Group C was the control group of 30 people who neither drink alcohol regularly nor are infected.

Body mass index (BMI), a measure of body size based on height and weight, was generally higher in those who drank alcohol frequently whether infected with H. pylori or not. However, the difference in BMI wasn't significant between those who were infected and those who weren't.

Generally, certain substances that signify inflammation were different between the groups. For example, lower levels of two inflammation markers, IL-10 and E-selectin, were found in those who drank alcohol and were infected with H. pylori compared to those that weren't infected. Those who drank alcohol but weren't infected showed higher levels of these markers than the control group.

However, the levels of another inflammation marker, TNF-α, were not very different among the groups. Levels of substances that signify cell damage were also not significantly different among the groups.

To sum it all up, we think that the H. pylori infection might weaken certain inflammation responses in those who drink alcohol regularly. Also, regular alcohol drinking might adjust inflammation levels. However, we found no relationship between the infection or regular alcohol drinking and cell damage.",What was measured during the study?,"The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",n/a (Unsectioned),2 - Goal,,

The aim of our study was to research the effects of levosimendan (LS) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) combination on systolic and diastolic ventricular function after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who required endoventricular patch repair (EVPR).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
We studied 70 patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. LS and SNP combination was administered in 35 patients (study group, SG). In the remaining patients, normal saline solution was given (placebo group, PG). Levosimendan (10μgr/kg) started 4 h prior to operation and we stopped LS before the initiation of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). During the rewarming period, we started again levosimendan (10μgr/kg) in combination with SNP (0.1-0.2 μgr/kg/min). If mean blood pressure decreased by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values, for corrected of mean arterial pressure, the volume loading was performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate. Hemodynamic variables, inotrophyc requirement, and laboratory values were recorded.

RESULTS.
Five patients died (7.14%) post-surgery (one from SG and 4 from PG) due to low cardiac out-put syndrome (LOS). At the postoperative period, cardiac output and stroke volume index was higher in SG (mean±sd;29.1±6.3 vs. 18.4±4.9 mL/min−1/m−2 (P≺0.0001)). Stroke volume index (SVI) decreased from 29±10mL/m2 preoperatively to 22±14mL/m2 in the early postoperative period in group 1. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.002). Cardiac index was higher in SG (320.7±37.5 vs. 283.0±83.9 mL/min−1/m−2 (P=0.009)). The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6±2.7 vs. 10.4±2.0 mg/kg, P≺ 0.008), and postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P≺ 0.01). Ten patients (28.5%) in SG and 21 patients (60%) in PG required inotrophyc support (P≺0.001). We used IABP in eight patients (22.8%) in SG and 17 patients (48.5%) in CG (P=0.0001).

CONCLUSION.
This study showed that LS and SNP combination impressive increase in left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions including LVEF. The use of this combination achieved more less inotrophics and IABP requirement. We therefore suggest preoperative and peroperative levosimendan and SNP combination.","GOAL:
Our study wanted to see how the combination of two drugs, levosimendan (LS) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), impacts the heart's ability to pump during and after heart bypass surgery in people who also needed another procedure to fix the inside wall of the heart.

HOW WE DID IT:
We had 70 heart disease patients with a type of heart damage that causes it to enlarge. We gave half the patients the drug combination and the other half a harmless salt solution (as a comparison group). The levosimendan was started 4 hours before surgery and stopped before the start of the heart bypass; during the last part of surgery, levosimendan was restarted along with SNP. If a patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during this process, a volume increasing solution was given to correct it. We recorded many patients' blood measurements, their need for heart-strengthening drugs, and laboratory test results.

WHAT WE FOUND:
After surgery, 5 patients died due to heart complications (one from the drug group and four from the comparison group). Patients given the drugs had stronger heart function stats compared to those who weren't. These patients also needed less supportive drugs and less interventional equipment post-surgery. Various measurements like cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac index were better in the drug group. Also, fewer people in the drug group needed help from heart-strengthening drugs or equipment post-surgery.

CONCLUSION:
The study shows that the LS and SNP combination really improved heart function during and after surgery. Using these drugs led to less need for other supporting drugs or equipment. Thus, we suggest using this drug combination before and during surgery.",What was a significant decrease in blood pressure?,A significant decrease in blood pressure was a drop in blood pressure of more than 25% compared to blood pressure before patients were given the drug combination.,Methods,5 - Method,,

This study examines whether cognitive function, as measured by the subtests of the Woodcock–Johnson III (WCJ-III) assessment, predicts listening-effort performance during dual tasks across the adults of varying ages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Participants were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 14 listeners (number of females = 11) who were 41–61 years old [mean = 53.18; standard deviation (SD) = 5.97]. Group 2 consisted of 15 listeners (number of females = 9) who were 63–81 years old (mean = 72.07; SD = 5.11). Participants were administered the WCJ-III Memory for Words, Auditory Working Memory, Visual Matching, and Decision Speed subtests. All participants were tested in each of the following three dual-task experimental conditions, which were varying in complexity: (1) auditory word recognition + visual processing, (2) auditory working memory (word) + visual processing, and (3) auditory working memory (sentence) + visual processing in noise.

RESULTS.
A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that task complexity significantly affected the performance measures of auditory accuracy, visual accuracy, and processing speed. Linear regression revealed that the cognitive subtests of the WCJ-III test significantly predicted performance across dependent variable measures.

CONCLUSION.
Listening effort is significantly affected by task complexity, regardless of age. Performance on the WCJ-III test may predict listening effort in adults and may assist speech-language pathologist (SLPs) to understand challenges faced by participants when subjected to noise.","PURPOSE.
This study aims to establish if a test we often use to assess thinking skills can also help us understand how hard adults of different ages find it to listen and do something else at the same time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
We had two groups of volunteers. The first group, made up of 14 people mostly women (11 out of 14), were aged between 41 and 61 years. The second group had 15 people, only nine women, aged between 63 and 81. We asked these people to do a few tests from the Woodcock–Johnson III. This is an assessment tool we typically use to evaluate how the brain processes information. Then our volunteers had to do two tasks at the same time. These tasks were a bit different for each round, but the idea was always the same: listen to something while also watching something.

RESULTS.
Looking at the results, it became clear that the difficulty of the task influences how well people did in terms of hearing accurately, seeing accurately, and how quickly they processed information. Additionally, the certain thinking-related subtests from the taken test could potentially help predict how well people performed in complex tests.

CONCLUSION.
It turns out that the more difficult the task, the harder it can be for anyone, regardless of their age, to listen and do another task at the same time. Also, the better someone does on the specific Woodcock–Johnson III test, the easier they might find doing two things at once.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are functionally the most important omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Oral supply of these fatty acids increases their levels in plasma and cell membranes, often at the expense of the omega-6 PUFAs arachidonic acid (ARA) and linoleic acid. This results in an altered pattern of lipid mediator production to one which is less pro-inflammatory. We investigated whether short term intravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs could change the levels of EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid in plasma and erythrocytes in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases.

METHODS.
Twenty patients were randomised to receive a 72 hour infusion of total parenteral nutrition with (treatment group) or without (control group) omega-3 PUFAs. EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid were measured in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) and erythrocytes at several times points up to the end of infusion and 5 to 12 days (mean 9 days) after stopping the infusion.

RESULTS.
The treatment group showed increases in plasma PC EPA and DHA and erythrocyte EPA and decreases in plasma PC and erythrocyte linoleic acid, with effects most evident late in the infusion period. Plasma PC and erythrocyte EPA and linoleic acid all returned to baseline levels after the 5–12 day washout. Plasma PC DHA remained elevated above baseline after washout.

CONCLUSIONS.
Intravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs results in a rapid increase of EPA and DHA in plasma PC and of EPA in erythrocytes. These findings suggest that infusion of omega-3 PUFAs could be used to induce a rapid effect especially in targeting inflammation.

http://www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00942292","BACKGROUND.
Omega-3 fatty acids, such as Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are very important for our body. When we take these acids orally, their levels increase in our blood and cell walls, which reduces inflammation. This study examined whether giving omega-3 fatty acids directly into a patient's veins could change the amounts of EPA, DHA, and other fatty acids in the blood of patients with liver cancer that originated from the colon or rectum.

METHODS.
Twenty patients were chosen at random to receive a 3-day intravenous nutrition treatment, either with or without (control group) omega-3 fatty acids. The fatty acids EPA, DHA, and others were measured in the blood plasma and red blood cells several times during and after the treatment.

RESULTS.
The group of patients who received omega-3 fatty acids showed increases in EPA and DHA levels and decreases in other fatty acid levels. These changes were have been found to be most significant late in the treatment period. Except for DHA levels, all others returned to normal 5-12 days after stopping the treatment. 

CONCLUSIONS.
Giving omega-3 fatty acids directly into a patient's veins leads to a quick increase in some fatty acids, which suggests that this method could be used to quickly target inflammation especially.

Obesity is a worldwide health problem which is associated with a lot of complications. One of these comorbidities is the metabolic syndrome that is in correlation with abdominal fat thickness and waist circumference. Various methods were used to reduce abdominal fat thickness such as liposuction. A noninvasive method is the topical agent. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of Arnebia euchroma (AE) ointment on the abdominal fat thickness.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
This study was a double-blind clinical trial which was done at the endocrinology clinic in Khorshid Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, in 2014. After explaining the procedure and obtaining informed consent, the candidates were randomly divided into the case and control groups. The participants of the case and control groups applied AE ointment or placebo for 6 weeks on their abdominal area. Body mass index, waist and buttock circumference, and abdominal fat thickness were measured in both case and control groups at their first visit and then at the next 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We used t-test for comparing parametric variables between groups, paired t-test for changes from baseline to final, and repeated measure ANOVA for changes at different steps.

RESULTS.
Sixty female candidates participated in this study (thirty in each group). Ten patients left the study and fifty participants finished the trial. At the end of the study, participants had a significant weight loss (2.96 ± 1.6 kg, P ≺ 0.001) that was slightly more in the case group (3.15 ± 1.5 kg vs. 2.75 ± 1.7, P = 0.375). Abdominal circumference also decreased significantly in the participants (11.3 ± 6.7 cm, P ≺ 0.001), but the changes were more significant in the case group (13.9 vs. 6.5 cm, P = 0.004).

Obesity is a major health issue around the world and can cause a range of other health problems. One of these problems is called metabolic syndrome, which is linked to fat in the stomach area. Various ways have been used to reduce this fat, like liposuction. A noninvasive method, meaning it doesn't involve surgery, is the use of a special cream. In this study, we looked at how effective Arnebia Euchroma (AE), a type of cream, is at reducing stomach fat.

The study was conducted in a medical clinic in Iran in 2014. After explaining the study and getting their approval, we divided the participants into two groups. One group used the AE cream on their stomach area for 6 weeks, the other group used a placebo (a cream with no active ingredients). We measured their body mass index, waist and buttock size, and stomach fat at the beginning, and then again after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We used different statistical methods to compare the results.

RESULTS.
Sixty women took part in the study (thirty in each group). Ten dropped out, so fifty completed it. By the end, the participants had lost a significant amount of weight (around 2.96 kg), slightly more in the group using the AE cream. Their waist size also went down significantly, more so in the AE group.

Working memory plays a critical role in cognitive processes which are central to our daily life. Neuroimaging studies have shown that one of the most important areas corresponding to the working memory is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC). This study was aimed to assess whether bilateral modulation of the DLPFC using a noninvasive brain stimulation, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), modifies the working memory function in healthy adults.

METHODS.
In a randomized sham-controlled cross-over study, 60 subjects (30 Males) received sham and active tDCS in two subgroups (anode left/cathode right and anode right/cathode left) of the DLPFC. Subjects were presented working memory n-back task while the reaction time and accuracy were recorded.

RESULTS.
A repeated measures, mixed design ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the type of stimulation (sham vs. active) in anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC [F(1,55)= 5.29, P=0.019], but not the inverse polarity worsened accuracy in the 2-back working memory task. There were also no statistically significant changes in speed of working memory [F(1,55)= 0.458,P=0.502] related to type or order of stimulation.

DISCUSSION.
The results would imply to a polarity dependence of bilateral tDCS of working memory. Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair working memory, while the reverser stimulation had no effect. Meaning that bilateral stimulation of DLFC would not be a useful procedure to improve working memory. Further studies are required to understand subtle effects of different tDCS stimulation/inhibition electrode positioning on the working memory.","INTRODUCTION.
Working memory is essential for how we learn, remember, and interact with the world. One area of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), is particularly important for working memory. Our goal in this study was to see if we could change how the DLPFC works to improve memory using a safe, non-invasive method called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

METHODS.
We had 60 people (half men, half women) take part in our study. We split them into two groups and used tDCS to stimulate different sides of their DLPFC. All participants were given tasks to test their working memory while we measured their speed and accuracy.

RESULTS.
Our analysis indicated that the type of stimulation mattered. When we stimulated the left side of the DLPFC and reduced activity on the right side, it clearly messed with participants' memory accuracy. However, doing the opposite didn't have any noticeable effect. No changes in speed were seen either way.

DISCUSSION.
Our results suggest that how we use tDCS on working memory matters, and that stimulating the left side of the DLPFC while reducing activity on the right could disrupt memory. This means that using tDCS on both sides of this part of the brain may not be helpful for improving memory. We need more research to understand better how different uses of tDCS can affect working memory.",What task did the participants complete to test speed and accuracy in their working memory?,"The participants completed the working memory n-back task, which requires participants to decide whether each stimulus in a sequence matches the one that appeared n items ago.",Methods,5.2 - Outcome (Tool),,

Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g · kg−1 · d−1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g · kg−1 · d−1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children ≺24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol · kg−1 · min−1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (−0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (−0.20 to 0.63) μmol · kg−1 · min−1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

Babies who have heart surgery may not get enough protein. This is because having surgery and using a heart-lung machine during the operation might break down protein faster than normal, and these babies might not eat enough to replace it. This study was done to see how giving these babies more protein after surgery would affect their protein levels.

METHODS.
We conducted a study where we randomly chose some babies to get a lot of protein and some to get a normal amount. This was done on the second day after they had surgery to fix heart defects they were born with. We did a special test to measure how much of a kind of protein called ""valine"" their bodies were making. We also measured how much of another protein called ""albumin"" their bodies were making. We then compared the results between the two groups.

RESULTS.
28 babies, who were around 9 months old and weighed about 7 kg, took part in the study. However, we could only use the data from 20 of them for our final results. Because we didn't have enough data, we couldn't make conclusions about protein levels. There was no difference in albumin production between the two groups. However, we saw that the babies getting a lot of protein had higher levels of valine and another substance called BUN, which is an indicator of how much protein a person is getting.

CONCLUSIONS.
It looks like the extra protein in the diet of the high-protein group might have increased the levels of valine and BUN. However, because we didn't have enough data, we can't say for sure that a high-protein diet would change protein levels in these babies. Therefore, the results from our study should be taken as a starting point for further research.

In the present study, we evaluated Se status in UK pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 UK primiparous women to treatment with Se (60 μg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. UK pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than US women, GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women, and low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3·00, range 0·90–5·80 mg/l). Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0·040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0·054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0·38, 95 % CI 0·17, 0·87, P= 0·021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0·30, 95 % CI 0·09, 1·00, P= 0·049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH. Therefore, UK women of childbearing age need to improve their Se status.","This abstract is about a study that explored the connection between a mineral called selenium (Se) and high blood pressure conditions during pregnancy, specifically, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and pre-eclampsia (PE). Mothers-to-be who consume inadequate amounts of selenium may be more likely to develop these conditions.

The study involved 230 first-time mothers in the UK who were randomly chosen to either receive a selenium supplement or a placebo from the 12th week of pregnancy onwards. Researchers took multiple measurements and assessments related to the women's selenium levels throughout the pregnancy.

The researchers found that the selenium levels of pregnant women in the UK were lower compared to those of pregnant women in other countries. Factors like age, level of education, and social class positively impacted selenium levels. Women who ate Brazil nuts or consumed more than two seafood servings a week also showed higher selenium levels. 

The research revealed that the lower the selenium level in the toenails (which is an indicator of the body's selenium status), the higher the chances were for a woman to develop PIH or PE. Women who took the selenium supplement were found to be less at risk of developing these conditions.

To sum up, the study concluded that women in the UK planning to have children should increase their selenium intake, as low levels of this mineral may increase their chances of developing PIH or PE.",How did selenium levels of pregnant women in the UK vary from those of pregnant women in other countries?,"The selenium (mineral) levels of pregnant women in the UK were lower compared to those of pregnant women in other countries, including having lower selenium levels in their toenails compared to women in the US, considerably lower levels of cellular defense mechanisms (GPx3 activity) compared to US and Australian women, and a lower amount of selenium being excreted through urine (SEPP1).",n/a (Unsectioned),7 - Results - Contrast,,

Persistent neuroinflammation and disruptions in brain energy metabolism is commonly seen in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because of the lack of success of most TBI interventions and the documented benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our study on use of EE in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.

RESULTS.
Our results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, EE housing was able to restore the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mTBI.","BACKGROUND.
Brain injuries often lead to long-lasting inflammation and energy disruptions in brain activities. Despite several medical treatments, their effectiveness has been limited. However, it is known that environment enrichment (EE) - an uplifting environment - can help in boosting brain recovery. This study therefore looked into how EE can help in reducing inflammation and restoring energy balance in the brain after a minor brain injury. We conducted our study on adult male rats, which either had a minor brain injury or a fake surgery. These rats were then placed in either an EE or normal living conditions. After four weeks, we tested their cognitive abilities and measured the levels of inflammatory proteins in their brain. We also checked for levels of certain proteins that regulate brain energy balance.

RESULTS.
Our findings showed that EE: (1) reduced the inflammation-causing proteins and increased healing proteins following a minor brain injury; (2) lessened the cognitive problems caused by the minor brain injury; and (3) diminished the decline in energy regulating proteins from the minor brain injury.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our study suggests that EE can help to control persistent: (1) inflammation in the brain after a minor brain injury, and (2) the ongoing disruption in brain energy balance. Through these effects, EE could help to fix the energy imbalance and improve brain recovery after a minor injury.",How were the rats' cognitive abilities tested?,"The rats' cognitive abilities were tested using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks, in which the subject must choose the stimulus that does not match the test (sample) stimulus that was presented before the recall delay.",Background,5.2 - Outcome (Tool),,

Because foods fortified with calcium are increasingly available, the calcium content of calcium-fortified foods may not be adequately captured in traditional assessments of dietary intake, such as dietary records analyzed with commercially available software. The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.

METHODS.
We studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.

RESULTS.
The correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P ≺ .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P ≺ .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P ≺ .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and Χ2 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P ≺ .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P ≺ .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P ≺ .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P ≺ .001). Dairy was the primary calcium source for both groups (55% of intake for black women and 57% of intake for white women).

CONCLUSION.
The CFFFQ can be used to identify postmenopausal women with inadequate calcium intakes (≺800 mg/d) and to identify key sources of dietary calcium. Older black women consume less daily calcium than do older white women.","INTRODUCTION:
More and more foods are being boosted with extra calcium. Because of this, it might be hard for traditional methods that measure how much calcium a person gets from their food to accurately work out how much they're really getting, especially if these methods are using off-the-shelf software. We wanted to create and test a special questionnaire that focused on calcium intake, which would also take into account foods naturally full of calcium and those that have extra calcium added to them. We also wanted to take a closer look at where black and white women going through menopause, in particular, get their calcium from and whether or not they're getting enough.

METHODS:
We worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years. They were asked to recall everything they've eaten in the last 24 hours and then answer our 46-item special calcium questionnaire. 

RESULTS:
We found that the daily calcium intake measured by our questionnaire strongly matched with the 24-hour food recall. Interestingly, our questionnaire showed a higher total daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall. As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall underestimated the amount of calcium intake compared to our questionnaire. Our results also showed that dairy was the main source of calcium for both black and white women. Though our questionnaire estimated a higher amount of calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall, it was more accurate in identifying low calcium intakes.

CONCLUSION:
Our special questionnaire can be used to find out if women going through menopause are not getting enough calcium in their diet (less than 800 milligrams per day). Additionally, it can shed light on the main sources of dietary calcium. We also found that older black women tend to consume less daily calcium than older white women.",What questionnaire was used for this study?,The 46-item calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) was used for this study.,Results,5.2 - Outcome (Tool),,

Recent research has shown that adopting strong (i.e. high fear) visual health-warning messages can increase the perceived health risks and intentions to reduce alcohol consumption. Separately, it is known that the speed at which alcohol is consumed has dramatic effects on the level of intoxication. In the present study we aimed to combine these two separate areas to understand whether the speed of alcohol consumption is influenced by the type of alcohol health warning contained on the beverage.

SUBJECT AND METHODS.
In the present study, female participants (N = 45) consumed an alcoholic beverage in a relaxed environment in one of three conditions: no health-warning label, a text-only health-warning label or a pictorial health-warning label with text.

RESULTS.
We found that compared with the control condition, the beverage was consumed at a slower rate in the two health-warning conditions, which surprisingly did not differ from each other. Despite these effects, product acceptability did not differ between the text-only and control conditions.

CONCLUSION.
These are the first set of results to demonstrate how the use of strong health warnings on alcoholic beverages can influence actual drinking rate and further suggest that the beneficial effects of slowed consumption are possible in the absence of any reduction in consumer acceptability.","AIM.
This study aimed to find out if the kind of health warning on an alcoholic drink's bottle can affect how quickly people drink it. Previous studies found that scary health warnings make people realize the risks of drinking more clearly, and lead them to want to drink less. Another study showed that the faster you drink, the more drunk you get. We combined these two ideas to see if the type of health warning can make people drink slower.

SUBJECT AND METHODS.
We tested this idea on 45 women. We gave them an alcoholic drink in a relaxed setting. There were three different groups: one group had drinks with no health warning, one had drinks with only a text warning, and one had drinks with a warning that included a picture and text.

RESULTS.
We found that women drank slower when their drinks had a health warning, regardless of whether it was just text or included a picture. Interestingly, the speed was the same in both health warning groups. However, whether the drink had a warning or not did not affect whether they liked the drink.

CONCLUSION.
This is the first study to show that strong health warnings on alcoholic drinks can make people drink slower. It also suggests that these warnings can be used without making the drink less appealing to consumers.",What kind of health warnings are used to increase perceived health risks of alcohol?,"Strong, high-fear visual health warnings are used to increase perceived health risks of alcohol.",Background,2 - Goal,,

We examined the efficacy of olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) in improving health-related quality of life (QoL) in the treatment of bipolar depression in children and adolescents.
METHODS.
Patients aged 10–17 years with bipolar I disorder, depressed episode, baseline children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) total score ≥40, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score ≤15, and YMRS-item 1 ≤ 2 were randomized to OFC (6/25–12/50 mg/day olanzapine/fluoxetine; n = 170) or placebo (n = 85) for up to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients and parents completed the revised KINDL questionnaire for measuring health-related QoL in children and adolescents (KINDL-R) at baseline and endpoint. The mean change in CDRS-R total and item scores were used to compare improvement in symptomatology in patients taking OFC and placebo. Tests were 2-sided using a Type I error cutoff of 0.05, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
RESULTS.
Baseline QoL as measured by the KINDL-R was substantially impaired relative to published norms for a healthy school-based sample. OFC-treated patients demonstrated an improvement over placebo at endpoint with respect to mean change from baseline in the patient-rated KINDL-R Self-esteem subscale score (p = 0.028), and in the parent KINDL-R ratings of emotional well-being (p = 0.020), Self-esteem (p = 0.030), and Family (p = 0.006). At endpoint, OFC-treated patients still had a lower QoL compared to the normative population. OFC showed significant improvement (p ≤ 0.05) versus placebo on the CDRS-R total score and on 7 of the 17 CDRS-R items.
CONCLUSIONS.
Patients aged 10–17 years with an acute episode of bipolar depression and their parents reported greater improvements (parents noticed improvements in more areas than did their offspring) on some aspects of QoL when treated with OFC compared with placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, KINDL-R endpoint scores remained lower than those of the, presumably healthy, control population.

This study looked at whether a combination of two drugs, olanzapine and fluoxetine (OFC), is effective in helping improve the life quality of kids and teenagers suffering from bipolar depression. 

METHODS.
Patients between the ages of 10 and 17 who have bipolar I disorder and are currently in a depressive phase were selected for this study. These patients were then divided into two groups: one received the drug combination (OFC), and the other received a placebo (a substance with no treatment effect). They were treated for up to 8 weeks. Using a questionnaire filled out by both patients and their parents at the beginning and end of the study, we were able to measure their life quality. We also checked the degree of depression symptoms by comparing scores of specific scales before and after treatment. 

RESULTS.
At the start of the study, the patients' quality of life was much lower than what you'd expect from a healthy child or teenager of the same age. After treatment, those who received the drug combination showed improvement in how they felt about themselves and in their emotional well-being, according to both the children and their parents. The parents also noted improvements in family dynamics. However, even after treatment, these patients' quality of life remained lower than that of a typical healthy child or teenager. The group that received the drug combination also demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared to the placebo group.

CONCLUSIONS.
Based on the study, children and teenagers experiencing a depressive phase of bipolar disorder, as well as their parents, reported better improvements in some aspects of life quality when treated with the drug combination than with the placebo.

This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (RCT) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6–17 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (MMN) including zinc (451 in each group).

Two years later, they got a random group of 184 kids from the original set to take part in another round of tests. They tested their intelligence, memory, and other brain functions, as well as their social-emotional skills. 

The results showed that the type of supplement they had as babies didn't make a difference in these areas. However, there was a noticeable difference between boys and girls. For example, girls generally had higher scores in verbal intelligence and social skills, while boys had higher scores in problem behaviour. 

These findings mean that giving extra nutrients beyond iron did not make a difference to these children's cognitive function in the long term.

This was a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at the Diabetes Center, Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo. Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8–18.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3–18 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C ≻6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000–10,000, platelets ≻100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.

RESULTS.
A1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 ± 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 ± 1.2%; P ≺ 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 ± 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 ± 0.21; P ≺ 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P ≺ 0.05).

Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS.
In this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of β-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.","GOAL.
The goal of this study was to test if a drug called etanercept could help children with newly detected type 1 diabetes continue making their own insulin for longer.

STUDY DESIGN. 
This was a six-month experiment carried out at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo's Diabetes Center. A diverse group of 18 kids aged between 7.8-18.2 years participated. They were randomly split into two groups. One group received etanercept, and the other got a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect). The researchers used standard criteria, including age, health status, insulin injections, and general health markers to select the participants. They treated all participants equally whether they finished the study or not.

FINDINGS. 
At the end of the study, the group that received etanercept had a lower average blood sugar level and seemed to be making more of their own insulin than the placebo group. Their average insulin dose decreased by 18%, while the placebo group's average dose increased by 23%. Importantly, none of the patients dropped out due to side effects from the etanercept.

CONCLUSIONS. 
This small preliminary study suggests that etanercept might help children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes maintain their ability to produce insulin. Therefore, etanercept might delay the point at which patients need to rely entirely on insulin injections. More extensive research is needed to confirm this possibility and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach.",How many patients completed the study?,Seventeen patients completed the study.,Results,6 - Results,,

Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a ubiquitous problem with serious public health implications. The fast track area is a novel method which aims to reduce waiting time, patient dissatisfaction and morbidity. |The study objective was to determine the impact of a fast track area (FTA) on both effectiveness measures (i.e. waiting times [WT] and length of stay [LOS]) and quality measures (i.e. LWBS rates and mortality rates) in non-urgent patients. The secondary objective was to assess if a FTA negatively impacted on urgent patients entering the ED.

METHODS.
The study took place in a 500 bed, urban, tertiary care hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This was a quasi-experimental, which examined the impact of a FTA on a pre-intervention control group (January 2005) (n = 4,779) versus a post-intervention study group (January 2006) (n = 5,706).

Emergency departments (EDs) in hospitals are often crowded, which can lead to longer waiting times and unhappy patients.

The study was looking to see if this new area would really help with these factors. It also checked to see if this new area would negatively affect more urgent cases in the ED.

METHODS.
The study was conducted at a 500-bed hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It compared the waiting times and satisfaction rates of two groups: one before the FTA was introduced (in January 2005) and one after (in January 2006).

RESULTS.
The results showed that after the FTA was introduced, patients rated as less urgent in the ED waited 22 minutes less, on average. The very least urgent patients waited 28 minutes less. Even the more urgent cases benefited from shorter waiting times. The number of patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) dropped significantly from 4.7% to 0.7%. There was no notable change in the death rates after the FTA was opened.

Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) uses feedback from brain signals to guide stimulation. A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.

METHODS.
We applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of β activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0±0.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.

RESULTS.
UPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS.

CONCLUSION.
Bilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states.","INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.
This research is about a deep brain stimulation method, known as adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), where we use feedback from the brain to guide the process. From previous trials, we saw that aDBS had a strong positive impact on people with Parkinson's disease. Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.

METHODS.
We used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.

RESULTS. 
The treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.

After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.

RESULTS.
Our results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, EE housing was able to restore the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mTBI.","BACKGROUND.
Brain injuries often lead to long-lasting inflammation and energy disruptions in brain activities. Despite several medical treatments, their effectiveness has been limited. However, it is known that environment enrichment (EE) - an uplifting environment - can help in boosting brain recovery. This study therefore looked into how EE can help in reducing inflammation and restoring energy balance in the brain after a minor brain injury. We conducted our study on adult male rats, which either had a minor brain injury or a fake surgery. These rats were then placed in either an EE or normal living conditions. After four weeks, we tested their cognitive abilities and measured the levels of inflammatory proteins in their brain. We also checked for levels of certain proteins that regulate brain energy balance.

RESULTS.
Our findings showed that EE: (1) reduced the inflammation-causing proteins and increased healing proteins following a minor brain injury; (2) lessened the cognitive problems caused by the minor brain injury; and (3) diminished the decline in energy regulating proteins from the minor brain injury.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our study suggests that EE can help to control persistent: (1) inflammation in the brain after a minor brain injury, and (2) the ongoing disruption in brain energy balance. Through these effects, EE could help to fix the energy imbalance and improve brain recovery after a minor injury.",What proteins did the researchers check for when conducting observations on the rats?,"The researchers checked for pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (controls inflammatory responses), TNF-α (regulates the macrophages, which are found at infection sites or as mobile white blood cells to combat infections), and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (prevents inflammatory and autoimmune diseases). The researchers also checked for AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), which regulates cellular metabolism, phosphorylated AMPK (regulates balanced cellular functions), and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase), which is responsible for the transfer of high energy between the mitochondria to energy recovering and producing cells.",Background,2 - Goal,,

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (N=301 smokers) tested 200 and 400 μg doses administered 4 or 5 times over 6 months compared to placebo. 3'AmNic-rEPA recipients with the highest serum anti-nicotine antibody response (top 30% by AUC) were significantly more likely to attain 8 weeks continuous abstinence from weeks 19 through 26 than the placebo recipients (24.6% vs. 12.0%, p=0.024, OR=2.69, 95% CI, 1.14–6.37). The 5 injection 400 μg dose regimen had the greatest antibody response and had significantly higher abstinence rates than placebo. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept that 3'AmNic-rEPA elicits antibodies to nicotine and is associated with higher continuous abstinence rates, justifying its further development as a treatment for nicotine dependence.","Scientists have been testing a new nicotine vaccine, called NicVAX®, to see if it can help smokers quit. They wanted to know if more of the vaccine in the body leads to better quit rates and if giving more doses of the vaccine increases its effectiveness.

They conducted a study with 301 smokers, where some received either 200 or 400 μg doses of the vaccine, four or five times over six months, and others received a fake form of the vaccine (placebo). They found out that those who had the most significant immune response to the vaccine (the top 30%) were more likely to quit smoking for at least eight weeks compared to those who took the placebo (24.6% vs. 12.0%).

Interestingly, those who had the regimen of five shots of the higher dose (400 μg) were more likely to quit smoking than the placebo group too.

So, this study shows that NicVAX® can stimulate the body to produce nicotine antibodies and help smokers quit. This encourages further research to develop the vaccine as a potential treatment for nicotine addiction.",What about the nicotine vaccine could potentially help smokers quit?,"The nicotine vaccine boosts antibody concentrations, which helps to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to nicotine in the bloodstream and prevent and/or slow it from crossing the blood–brain barrier and entering the brain.

 To determine the effects of probiotic yogurt on performance and health status of young adultfemale endurance swimmers.

METHODS.
 In a randomized controlled trial, 46 endurance swimmers girls with mean age of 13.8 ±1.8 years,weight of 48.6±7.5kg and height of 159±5.6cm, were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups,receiving either 400 ml probiotic yogurt (intervention group) or ordinary yogurt (control group) daily for 8weeks. At the beginning and at the end of the study, the 400-m free swimming record was done and the HarvardStep test was employed to measure VO2max. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS software.This trial has been registered with IRCT ID of IRCT2012122311849N1.

RESULTS.
 Average changes in the records of the intervention and control groups were 3.9 and 0.5 seconds, respectively(p= 0.22). The intervention group complained of dyspnea for 2.4 days and the value for the controlwas 4.4 days (p=0.024). Values for ear pain were 0.5 and 1.6 days (p=0.008) respectively. The average numberof episodes of respiratory infection in the intervention group was 0.9 day, which was statistically fewer than thatin the control group (1.4 days), P=0.009.

CONCLUSIONS.
 A reduction in the number of episodes of respiratory infections and duration of some symptomssuch as dyspnea and ear pain was observed. Due to the reduction in upper respiratory tract infections of theathletes following intake of probiotic yogurt, improvement in VO2max is possible.","BACKGROUND.
This study aims to explore the results of eating probiotic yogurt on the physical performance and general health of young female swimmers.

METHODS.
We conducted a study with 46 young, female endurance swimmers, and split them into two groups randomly. We asked one group to consume 400 ml of probiotic yogurt daily for eight weeks while the other group was given regular yogurt. Then, we measured their swimming speed and their oxygen usage during exercise, both pre and post study. We analyzed all data using a specific type of software called SPSS. This study has been officially registered.

RESULTS.
On average, the probiotic yogurt group improved their swimming speed slightly more than the regular yogurt group. They also reported less difficulty breathing and ear pain, and had fewer respiratory infections.

CONCLUSIONS.
We observed that eating probiotic yogurt reduced respiratory infections and problems like difficulty with breathing and ear pain. This suggests that the intake of probiotic yogurt could enhance their oxygen usage during exercise due to less respiratory tract infections.",How old were the participants?,The participants were on average 13.8 years old.,Methods,5.5 - Population,,

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of preoperatively administered i.v. hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Fifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.

RESULTS.
The mean age of patients was 36.68 ± 10.8 years. Forty percent of patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean of DBP at min 2, 5, and 15, mean of HR at all time points and mean of MAP at min 2 and 15 between groups were no significantly different (P ≻ 0.05), but mean of SBP at min 10 and 15, mean of DBP at min 10, and mean of MAP at min 5 and 10 in hypertonic saline group was significantly more than the normal group (P ≺ 0.05). Trend of SBP, DBP, HR and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P ≻ 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS.
Infusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension.","BACKGROUND.
This study was focused on looking at how giving a strong salt solution (hypertonic saline) by IV before surgery influences low blood pressure that can happen after putting a patient to sleep for the surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
We studied 54 patients who were going to have surgery. They were divided into two groups of 27 people each - one group was given a strong salt solution and the other was given a normal salt solution. The strong salt solution was given half an hour before the patient was put to sleep for surgery. We followed the same anesthesia process for all patients. We kept track of the patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, heart rate, and the average pressure in their arteries.

RESULTS.
The average age of the patients was about 37 years old, and 40% of them were men. We found that the strong salt solution didn't have a significant effect on the patients' blood pressure or heart rate at certain time points. However, other time points showed a significant increase in the blood pressure and average arterial pressure for patients who were given the strong salt solution.

Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain is a prevalent, underdiagnosed cause of lower back pain. SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.

METHODS.
We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.

RESULTS.
Subjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority ≻0.999). Clinically important (≥15 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 27.3% of NSM subjects. At six months, quality of life improved more in the surgery group and satisfaction rates were high. The mean number of adverse events in the first six months was slightly higher in the surgical group compared to the non-surgical group (1.3 vs. 1.0 events per subject, p=0.1857).

CONCLUSIONS.
Six-month follow-up from this level 1 study showed that minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving function and improving quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE.
Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is an acceptable option for patients with chronic SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroiliac joint disruptions unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.","BACKGROUND.
Lower back pain is often caused by a problem in the area where your spine connects to your hips, called the sacroiliac joint. Sometimes, this pain can be treated by using surgery to fuse or join together parts of this joint. However, we don't have any studies yet that have compared how patients do with this surgery versus without it.

METHODS.
We set up a study with 148 patients who had problems with their sacroiliac joint. We randomly picked some to get a special kind of low-impact surgery (102 people), while others (46 people) were treated without surgery. We measured how much pain and disability our patients were feeling when the study started. Then, we checked on them 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to see if there was an improvement. 

RESULTS.
Our patients, most of whom were women and averaged 51 years of age, were having a lot of trouble with pain and disability at the start of the study. We were able to follow up with almost all of them at the six-month mark. By then, about 81.4% of the surgery patients were doing significantly better, compared to 23.9% of the non-surgery group. Also, 75% of the surgery group showed great improvement in how they were able to move around and do daily activities versus 27.3% in the non-surgery group. Finally, the surgery patients generally felt happier and more satisfied. 
However, it's worth mentioning that slightly more surgery patients experienced complications or side effects than non-surgery patients.

CONCLUSIONS.
After six months, the results of our high-level study show that the low-impact surgery is much more effective than non-surgery treatment in reducing pain, improving motion, and increasing the happiness of patients who have problems with their sacroiliac joint.

Patients with glaucoma who do not keep their follow-up eye care appointments are at risk for developing more severe ocular disease. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Patients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.

RESULTS.
A total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (±standard deviation) was 71.2 (±10.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155). The mean (±standard deviation) number of follow-up visits during the 1-year study period was 1.3 (±1.3) for G1, 1.6 (±1.3) for G2, and 1.3 (±1.1) for G3 (P=0.48). Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of ≥1 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28). Sub-analysis of adherence rates for patients who attended ≥2 follow-up visits were 91.3% (n=21/23) for G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) for G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) for G3, (P=0.11).

CONCLUSION.
Help from a patient navigator did not increase the likelihood of keeping ≥1 follow-up appointment in an office-based setting. Adherence rates for follow-up appointments reached close to 70% or above in a self-selected patient population.","PURPOSE.
This study looked at how having a 'patient navigator' - a person who helps guide a patient through their healthcare journey - could change how regularly patients with glaucoma go to their follow-up eye check-ups. This is important because missed appointments can lead to worse vision problems. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS. 
The study used people who were diagnosed with some form of glaucoma after taking an eye test in Philadelphia, USA. These people were put into three groups for one year: one group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator, the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator, and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator. Then, they compared how well each group stuck to their appointment schedule. 

RESULTS.
155 patients were included in this study. They were generally around 71 years old, mostly women, and primarily African-American. The number of follow-up visits during the year was about the same between the three groups. Around 70% to 82% of patients in all groups attended at least one follow-up visit. When looking at only the people who attended two or more follow-up visits, the group with a patient navigator within the community had the highest turn out. 

CONCLUSION.
Even though having a patient navigator didn't make people more likely to go to an office for their check-ups, people did have a decent rate of attendance at their follow-up visits on their own. It is unclear if the community-based care with a navigator helped with the higher rate of attendance for two or more check-ups, which suggests more study is needed.",What was the major criterion for patients to participate in the study?,"The 155 patients who participated in this study had a glaucoma-related diagnosis, meaning they had been diagnosed with an eye condition that causes vision loss.",Results,1.1 - Inclusion Criteria,,

The aim was to compare efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2% in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)/ocular hypertension (OHT).

SETTINGS AND DESIGN.
Open, randomized, cross-over, comparative study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Forty patients of POAG or OHT with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≺30 mm Hg were included in the study after a written informed consent. The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 20 patients each. Patients of group A were administered bimatoprost 0.03% eye drops once daily, and those of group B brimonidine 0.2% eye drops twice daily for a period of 4 weeks. After a washout period of 4 weeks, the patients were crossed over that is, group A was administered brimonidine 0.2% and group B bimatoprost 0.03%. Fall in IOP at 4 weeks was recorded. The daily cost of each drug was calculated by maximum retail price and the average number of drops per bottle. The cost-effectiveness was then calculated as the cost of drug/mm Hg fall in IOP.

STATISTICS.
Independent samples t-test was used to compare the efficacy of both drugs.

RESULTS.
IOP lowering with bimatoprost (8.9 ± 1.598 mm Hg) was significantly (P ≺ 0.0001) higher than brimonidine (6.55 ± 1.26 mm Hg). The number of drops/ml were 33.43 ± 0.52 and 25.49 ± 0.26, respectively, for bimatoprost and brimonidine. Treatment with bimatoprost was costlier than brimonidine with daily costs/eye Rs. 4.02 ± 0.06 and 3.14 ± 0.03, yearly costs/eye Rs. 1467.46 ± 20.74 and 1147.75 ± 11.15, respectively. Bimatoprost was more cost-effective than brimonidine with the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) respectively Rs. 13.10 ± 2.61/mm Hg and Rs. 13.96 ± 2.86/mm Hg. Incremental CER Rs. 10.43/mm Hg implies lower costs/mm Hg extra IOP lowering by bimatoprost than Rs. 13.96 for brimonidine.

CONCLUSION.
In spite of being costlier, bimatoprost is more efficacious and cost-effective than brimonidine.","GOAL:
We wanted to see if two particular eye drops, bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2%, work well and are good value for money for people with a specific eye condition causing increased eye pressure (called primary open-angle glaucoma) or high eye pressure (ocular hypertension).

HOW WE DID IT:
We carried out a study involving 40 volunteers who had these conditions but only mild eye pressure. We randomly divided them into two different groups. Half of them were given bimatoprost drops once a day, while the other half used brimonidine drops twice a day, for a month. After resting for a month, we switched the groups: the first group started using brimonidine, and the second group used bimatoprost. We recorded the drop in eye pressure after a month for both groups. We then calculated the cost per day of both treatments, and how much it cost per unit of pressure dropped (cost-effectiveness).

HOW WE FIGURED OUT THE RESULTS:
We used a common statistical method to compare how effective both drugs were.

RESULTS:
We found that bimatoprost was significantly more effective, reducing eye pressure more than brimonidine. However, bimatoprost was also more expensive on a per drop basis than brimonidine. Despite the higher price, when looking at the cost in relation to how much it lowers eye pressure, bimatoprost ended up being a more cost-effective option than brimonidine.

CONCLUSION:
Although it's a bit more expensive, bimatoprost is more effective and gives you more bang for your buck than brimonidine when it comes to treating these eye conditions.",What was the setting and design of the study?,"The study was an open (both participants and researchers knew who was assigned which drops), cross-over (the participants receive both treatments at some point in the study), comparative study (comparing the two drops).",Methods,5.1 - Experiment Protocol,,

Effective control of postoperative pain remains one of the most important and pressing issues in the field of surgery and has a significant impact on our health care system. In too many patients, pain is treated inadequately, causing them needless suffering and they can develop complications as an indirect consequence of pain. Analgesic modalities, if properly applied, can prevent or at least minimize this needless suffering and these complications.

OBJECTIVES.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetic drugs by paravertebral and epidural routes in controlling postoperative pain in patients undergoing hip surgeries.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
The study involved 60 patients who were undergoing hip surgery under the subarachnoid block. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 patients. Group I (paravertebral group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 2.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 mL/h in the paravertebral space. Group II (epidural group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 mL/hr in the epidural space for 48 hours in the postoperative period. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, vital statistics, rescue analgesia, and procedure time were compared with the corresponding times between the 2 groups by student's t-test and repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni. P ≺ 0.05 was considered significant. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding mean pain score in the first 48 hours.

RESULTS.
Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the epidural group compared with the paravertebral group from 2 hours after start of the infusion until 48 hrs. Regional anesthesia procedure time was significantly longer in the epidural group (P ≺ 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding frequency of postoperative complications and catheter-related problems.

CONCLUSIONS.
The results of our study indicate that for patients who are scheduled for hip surgery, both continuous paravertebral and continuous epidural analgesia are effective in controlling postoperative pain but that the former has several crucial advantages.","BACKGROUND.
Controlling pain after surgery is a big challenge in the world of health care. Too many patients do not have their pain effectively controlled, which not only causes them unnecessary suffering but could also lead to other health problems. Proper use of pain relief methods can prevent or at least decrease this unnecessary suffering and these extra health issues.

OBJECTIVES.
We wanted to compare how well two different methods of giving local anesthetic drugs continuously could control pain after hip surgery. The drugs were given either beside the spinal column (paravertebral) or into the space around the spinal column (epidural).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Our study involved 60 people getting hip surgery. They were split into 2 groups of 30. One group had a single dose of spinal anesthesia plus a continuous flow of the anesthetic drug beside the spinal column. The other group had the same single dose of spinal anesthesia but a continuous flow of the drug into the space around the spinal column instead. We then compared the levels of pain, basic health measurements, need for additional pain relief, and the time taken to do the procedure between the two groups.

RESULTS.
On average, the group getting the drug into the space around the spinal column had lower blood pressure from 2 hours after the drug was started until 48 hours later. It also took longer to give the anesthetic this way. However, there were no differences in the frequency of surgical complications between the two groups or in the problems related to where the drug was given.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our study suggests that continuously giving local anesthetic beside the spinal column or into the space around it both can control pain effectively after hip surgery. However, giving it beside the spinal column might be advantageous in certain ways.",How were the results analyzed?,The results of the test were analyzed using a t-test (tests the averages of two groups) and ANOVA (compares more than two treatment groups) and was adjusted to get the most conservative results.,Methods,5.3 - Analysis Technique,,

Induction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.

METHODS.
In a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 ± 2, 50 ± 2 and 40 ± 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.

RESULTS.
BIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.

CONCLUSIONS.
These results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.","BACKGROUND.
Getting the right level of anesthesia for a surgery is very important. For children, the most common method is to have them breathe in the anesthetic. A tube may need to be put down the throat once the child is deeply asleep. It can be hard to tell exactly how deep the sleep is. One way to measure this is using something called a Bispectral index (BIS). In this study, we wanted to see how well the BIS can tell us when a child is asleep enough for the tube to be safely put in.
METHODS.
We did a test with ninety children who were aged 1 to 6 years and were about to have surgery. We started to monitor their BIS and separated them randomly into three groups. The anesthesia was started by gradually increasing the amount of anesthetic in a mix of oxygen and nitrous oxide. We kept increasing until the BIS reached certain target levels. After the tube was put in, we noted how long the process took, whether there were any complications like trouble breathing, if the child moved, and how long they stayed asleep. RESULTS.
The BIS didn't help us to know the best level of anesthesia for putting the tube in. There was no difference in how long it took, whether there were any problems, or how long the children stayed asleep between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS.
Our results showed that there wasn't a significant difference in problems related to putting in the tube at different BIS levels.

Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8–18.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3–18 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C ≻6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000–10,000, platelets ≻100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.

RESULTS.
A1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 ± 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 ± 1.2%; P ≺ 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 ± 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 ± 0.21; P ≺ 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P ≺ 0.05). From baseline to week 24 insulin dose decreased 18% in the etanercept group compared with a 23% increase in the placebo group (P ≺ 0.05). Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS.
In this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of β-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.","GOAL.
The goal of this study was to test if a drug called etanercept could help children with newly detected type 1 diabetes continue making their own insulin for longer.

STUDY DESIGN. 
This was a six-month experiment carried out at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo's Diabetes Center. A diverse group of 18 kids aged between 7.8-18.2 years participated. They were randomly split into two groups. One group received etanercept, and the other got a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect). The researchers used standard criteria, including age, health status, insulin injections, and general health markers to select the participants. They treated all participants equally whether they finished the study or not.

FINDINGS. 
At the end of the study, the group that received etanercept had a lower average blood sugar level and seemed to be making more of their own insulin than the placebo group. Their average insulin dose decreased by 18%, while the placebo group's average dose increased by 23%. Importantly, none of the patients dropped out due to side effects from the etanercept.

CONCLUSIONS. 
This small preliminary study suggests that etanercept might help children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes maintain their ability to produce insulin. Therefore, etanercept might delay the point at which patients need to rely entirely on insulin injections. More extensive research is needed to confirm this possibility and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach.",What criteria did the researchers use to select eligible participants?,"The researchers gathered participants between the ages of 3-18, participants who were GAD-65 (an autoimmune disease marker) and/or islet cell antibody (cell markers that appear when insulin producing cells in pancreas are damaged) positive, those who scored higher than 6% blood sugar levels on the A1C test (blood glucose level test), those who receive three insulin injections per day, those how have a white blood cell count between 3000-10000, those with a platelet of less than 100,000, and those with normal liver and renal function.",Methods,1.1 - Inclusion Criteria,,

Several studies have shown that maximizing stroke volume (or increasing it until a plateau is reached) by volume loading during high-risk surgery may improve post-operative outcome. This goal could be achieved simply by minimizing the variation in arterial pulse pressure (ΔPP) induced by mechanical ventilation. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized, single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the length of postoperative stay in hospital.

METHODS.
Thirty-three patients undergoing high-risk surgery were randomized either to a control group (group C, n = 16) or to an intervention group (group I, n = 17). In group I, ΔPP was continuously monitored during surgery by a multiparameter bedside monitor and minimized to 10% or less by volume loading.

RESULTS.
Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic data, American Society of Anesthesiology score, type, and duration of surgery. During surgery, group I received more fluid than group C (4,618 ± 1,557 versus 1,694 ± 705 ml (mean ± SD), P ≺ 0.0001), and ΔPP decreased from 22 ± 75 to 9 ± 1% (P ≺ 0.05) in group I. The median duration of postoperative stay in hospital (7 versus 17 days, P ≺ 0.01) was lower in group I than in group C. The number of postoperative complications per patient (1.4 ± 2.1 versus 3.9 ± 2.8, P ≺ 0.05), as well as the median duration of mechanical ventilation (1 versus 5 days, P ≺ 0.05) and stay in the intensive care unit (3 versus 9 days, P ≺ 0.01) was also lower in group I.

CONCLUSION.
Monitoring and minimizing ΔPP by volume loading during high-risk surgery improves postoperative outcome and decreases the length of stay in hospital.

NCT00479011","INTRODUCTION.
Research has shown that maintaining a healthy blood flow during major surgeries can help to improve recovery after the operation. One way to achieve this is by using a ventilator to regulate the pressure changes in the blood vessels during these operations. Our research aimed to find out if this method could shorten the length of a patient's stay in the hospital after surgery.

METHODS.
We did a study that involved 33 patients who were due for major surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group, made up of 16 patients, was treated normally and served as our basis for comparison. In the second group of 17 patients, we kept track of their blood pressure changes using a special monitor during surgery, and ensured that these changes remained small by giving them a lot of fluids.

RESULTS.
The two patient groups were similar in their demographic data, overall health condition, type of surgery, and surgery duration. Throughout the surgery, we noticed that the second group received more fluid and experienced a decline in their blood pressure changes. Also, this group generally spent less time in the hospital after surgery (7 days instead of 17). They also had fewer complications, spent less time on ventilators (1 day instead of 5), and stayed in the ICU for a shorter period (3 days instead of 9). 

CONCLUSION.
Our findings suggest that if we carefully monitor and control blood pressure changes by giving plenty of fluids during major surgery, it can improve the recovery outcomes. This includes reducing the number of complications, the length of time on a ventilator, and the duration of the hospital and ICU stay.

Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain is a prevalent, underdiagnosed cause of lower back pain. SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.

METHODS.
We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.

RESULTS.
Subjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%. By 6 months, success rates were 81.4% in the surgical group vs. 23.9% in the NSM group (difference of 56.6%, 95% posterior credible interval 41.4-70.0%, posterior probability of superiority ≻0.999). Clinically important (≥15 point) ODI improvement at 6 months occurred in 75% of surgery subjects vs. 27.3% of NSM subjects. At six months, quality of life improved more in the surgery group and satisfaction rates were high. The mean number of adverse events in the first six months was slightly higher in the surgical group compared to the non-surgical group (1.3 vs. 1.0 events per subject, p=0.1857).

CONCLUSIONS.
Six-month follow-up from this level 1 study showed that minimally invasive SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving function and improving quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE.
Minimally invasive SI joint fusion is an acceptable option for patients with chronic SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroiliac joint disruptions unresponsive to non-surgical treatments.","BACKGROUND.
Lower back pain is often caused by a problem in the area where your spine connects to your hips, called the sacroiliac joint. Sometimes, this pain can be treated by using surgery to fuse or join together parts of this joint. However, we don't have any studies yet that have compared how patients do with this surgery versus without it.

METHODS.
We set up a study with 148 patients who had problems with their sacroiliac joint. We randomly picked some to get a special kind of low-impact surgery (102 people), while others (46 people) were treated without surgery. We measured how much pain and disability our patients were feeling when the study started. Then, we checked on them 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to see if there was an improvement. 

RESULTS.
Our patients, most of whom were women and averaged 51 years of age, were having a lot of trouble with pain and disability at the start of the study. We were able to follow up with almost all of them at the six-month mark. By then, about 81.4% of the surgery patients were doing significantly better, compared to 23.9% of the non-surgery group. Also, 75% of the surgery group showed great improvement in how they were able to move around and do daily activities versus 27.3% in the non-surgery group. Finally, the surgery patients generally felt happier and more satisfied. 
However, it's worth mentioning that slightly more surgery patients experienced complications or side effects than non-surgery patients.

CONCLUSIONS.
After six months, the results of our high-level study show that the low-impact surgery is much more effective than non-surgery treatment in reducing pain, improving motion, and increasing the happiness of patients who have problems with their sacroiliac joint.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is commonly observed after eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery. This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that compared with monotherapy using a higher dose of palonosetron, using a lower dose of palonosetron in combination with droperidol could reduce the incidence of PONV and achieve similar prophylaxis against PONV after the aforementioned surgery.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
A total of 129 patients who were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II, aged between 18 and 70 years, and scheduled for eye enucleation and orbital hydroxyapatite implant surgery, were enrolled in this study. They were randomized into three groups: Group P2.5 (2.5 μg/kg palonosetron), Group P7.5 (7.5 μg/kg palonosetron), and Group P+D (2.5 μg/kg palonosetron and 15 μg/kg droperidol). Patients received the different antiemetic regimens intravenously 5 min before surgery. The severity of nausea and vomiting and the complete response (CR) rate during a 72-h postoperative period were assessed.

RESULTS.
All patients completed the trial. The nausea score of Group P2.5 was significantly higher than those of the other two groups at 0–4 h and 24–48 h (P≺0.05). Vomiting scores among all groups were similar during all intervals (P≻0.05). Compared with Group P2.5, the CR rate was significantly improved at all intervals in Group P+D, except at 4–72 h, and was also elevated at 24–72 h in Group P7.5 (P≺0.05). Fewer patients in Group P2.5 did not experience any nausea or vomiting throughout the study (49%) compared with those in Group P7.5 (67%) and Group P+D (81%; P≺0.01).

CONCLUSION.
Combining low-dose palonosetron with droperidol potentiated prophylaxis for PONV and achieved a similar prophylactic effect as that with a higher dose of palonosetron.","OBJECTIVE:
This study investigates if combining a low dose of the drug palonosetron with another drug called droperidol can help to reduce sickness (nausea and vomiting) experienced after a certain eye surgery, compared to using a higher dose of palonosetron alone. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS:
This trial involved 129 adults, aged 18 to 70, that are categorised as healthy or having mild illness by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. They were going to have eye and orbital implant surgery. These patients were divided into three groups and each group received different anti-sickness treatments just before their surgery. Their levels of nausea, vomiting, and overall response to treatment were assessed for 72 hours after surgery. 

RESULTS:
All involved patients finished the study. The group receiving a low dose of palonosetron had more severe nausea than the other two groups at 0-4 and 24-48 hours after surgery. Vomiting levels were similar across all the groups. The complete response (no nausea or vomiting) rate was better in the group receiving a low-dose of palonosetron and droperidol than in the low dose palonosetron alone group, except at 4-72 hours, and was also better at 24-72 hours in the high dose palonosetron group. Less than half (49%) of the patients in the low dose palonosetron alone group didn't experience any sickness, compared to 67% in the high dose group and 81% in the combined treatment group.

CONCLUSION:
Combining a low dose of palonosetron with droperidol was better at preventing post-surgery sickness and produced similar results to using a high dose of palonosetron alone.",How were the treatments given to patients?,The patients received their assigned treatment for 5 minutes before surgery through their veins.,Methods,5 - Method,,

Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) uses feedback from brain signals to guide stimulation. A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.

METHODS.
We applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of β activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0±0.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.

RESULTS.
UPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS.

CONCLUSION.
Bilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states.","INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.
This research is about a deep brain stimulation method, known as adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), where we use feedback from the brain to guide the process. From previous trials, we saw that aDBS had a strong positive impact on people with Parkinson's disease. Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.

METHODS.
We used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.

RESULTS. 
The treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.

CONCLUSION.
So, we conclude that using aDBS on both sides of the brain improves certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It's also able to adjust to the need for stimulation in patients taking medication.",How were improvements in symptoms analyzed?,The study utilized the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores (a questionnaire developed to look at Parkinson's disease symptoms) to look at improvements.,Background,5.2 - Outcome (Tool),,

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of preoperatively administered i.v. hypertonic saline on hypotension following induction of general anesthesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Fifty-four patients who scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to two groups of 27 patients who received hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 ml/kg) or received normal saline (13 ml/kg). Infusion of hypertonic saline was done half an hour before induction of anesthesia during 30 minutes. Anesthesia was conducted in a standard protocol for all patients. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were assessed in all patients.

RESULTS.
The mean age of patients was 36.68 ± 10.8 years. Forty percent of patients were male. The mean SBP at min 2 and min 5, mean of DBP at min 2, 5, and 15, mean of HR at all time points and mean of MAP at min 2 and 15 between groups were no significantly different (P ≻ 0.05), but mean of SBP at min 10 and 15, mean of DBP at min 10, and mean of MAP at min 5 and 10 in hypertonic saline group was significantly more than the normal group (P ≺ 0.05). Trend of SBP, DBP, HR and MAP between groups were not significantly different (P ≻ 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS.
Infusion of hypertonic saline 5% (2.3 mg/kg) before the general anesthesia led to a useful reduction in MAP and reduced heart rate, with no episodes of severe hypotension.","BACKGROUND.
This study was focused on looking at how giving a strong salt solution (hypertonic saline) by IV before surgery influences low blood pressure that can happen after putting a patient to sleep for the surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
We studied 54 patients who were going to have surgery. They were divided into two groups of 27 people each - one group was given a strong salt solution and the other was given a normal salt solution. The strong salt solution was given half an hour before the patient was put to sleep for surgery. We followed the same anesthesia process for all patients. We kept track of the patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, heart rate, and the average pressure in their arteries.

RESULTS.
The average age of the patients was about 37 years old, and 40% of them were men. We found that the strong salt solution didn't have a significant effect on the patients' blood pressure or heart rate at certain time points. However, other time points showed a significant increase in the blood pressure and average arterial pressure for patients who were given the strong salt solution.

CONCLUSIONS.
Giving a strong salt solution to patients before putting them to sleep for surgery can help avoid a big drop in blood pressure and a faster heart rate. It means there will be less chance of severe low blood pressure episodes.",When were blood pressure and heart rate higher in patients after being given strong salt solution?,"Higher systolic blood pressure (pressure when the heart is beating) was observed at 10 and 15 minutes, higher diastolic blood pressure (pressure when the heart is at rest) was observed at 10 minutes, and arterial pressure was higher at 5 and 10 minutes compared to the normal group.",Results,6 - Results,,

Due to increasing resistance to antibiotics and rising incidence of oral diseases, there is a need for alternative treatment modalities to combat oral diseases. The aim of the present study was to access the effect of Aloe vera mouthwash on the dental plaque in the experimental period of 4 days and to compare it with the bench mark control chlorhexidine and placebo (saline water).

MATERIAL AND METHODS.
A total of 300 systemically healthy subjects were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Aloe vera mouthwash group (n=100), control group (=100)-chlorhexidene group and saline water-Placebo (n=100). To begin with, Gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were recorded. Then, baseline plaque scores were brought to zero by professionally cleaning the teeth with scaling and polishing. After randomization of the participants into three groups they were refrained from regular mechanical oral hygiene measures. Subjects were asked to swish with respective mouthwash (Aloe vera mouthwash, 0.2%chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, or normal saline) as per therapeutic dose for 4 days.

RESULTS.
The results showed that Aloe vera mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing plaque as Chlorhexidine compared to placebo over a period of 4 days. There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them (p≻0.05). Aloe vera mouthwash showed no side effects.

CONCLUSION.
The results of the present study indicated that Aloe vera may prove an effective mouthwash due to its ability in reducing dental plaque.","BACKGROUND.
There's a growing problem with antibiotics not working as effectively, and more people are experiencing oral diseases. This study was to see if Aloe vera mouthwash could help with oral health issues, particularly dental plaque. Specifically, we wanted to see how Aloe vera mouthwash worked over four days, compared to the usual mouthwash (chlorhexidine) and a mouthwash that isn't supposed to do anything (saline water).

Material and Methods.
300 healthy volunteers were split into three equal groups. One group used Aloe vera mouthwash, another used chlorhexidine mouthwash (the usual stuff), and the third used saline water (which doesn't do anything). At the start, we tested the health of everyone's gums (ginigval index) and how much plaque they had (plaque index). We then cleaned everyone's teeth professionally so everyone started with no plaque. For the next four days, the volunteers only used their assigned mouthwash, without brushing or flossing. 

RESULTS.
The study found that both the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash were equally good at reducing plaque over those four days. Meanwhile, the saline water didn't do much (as expected). The difference in plaque reduction between the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash wasn't significant enough to matter. Also, no one reported any bad side effects from the Aloe vera mouthwash.

CONCLUSION.
Based on this study, Aloe vera could be a good alternative mouthwash. It was successful in reducing dental plaque, just as effective as the usual chlorhexidine mouthwash, but without any side effects.",How reliable are these results?,"Both the Aloe vera and the chlorhexidine groups saw a significant reduction in plaque, meaning these results were unlikely to occur by chance.",Results,6 - Results,,

Induction of labour (IOL) is one of the commonest obstetric interventions, with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery. Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient IOL medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (OPC) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (IP) for induction of labour (IOL) at term.

METHODS.
Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (OPC, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (IP, n = 51). OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.

RESULTS.
OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p ≺ .001), IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). Vaginal birth rates (66% OPC Vs. 71% IP), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs OPC Vs. 105 hrs IP) were similar. OPC group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p ≺ .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).

CONCLUSIONS.
OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL.

Sometimes, doctors need to induce labor in pregnant women, which means they have to artificially start the labor process. This is a common procedure that affects both the woman and the health care system. One way to reduce the impact, is to carry out the procedure in an outpatient setting, meaning the patient can go home after the procedure instead of staying at the hospital. There's not much information on how outpatient and inpatient inductions compare, and also some safety worries if outpatient inductions use a certain medication used in inpatient settings. This study is aiming to see if it's feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients to induce labor in an outpatient setting using a Foley catheter, compared to inpatient inductions using vaginal PGE2.

METHODS.
In the study, 101 women who needed labor induced were split into two groups. 50 women were in the outpatient group and used a Foley catheter for induction. These women were able to go home overnight after a reassuring test. The other 51 women were in the inpatient group and used vaginal PGE2 for induction. The main things checked were how long the hospital stay was, how the baby was born, how long it took from induction to delivery, any side effects, and how satisfied the patients were.

RESULTS.
Women in the outpatient group spent less time in the hospital before giving birth, but those in the inpatient group were more likely to have a vaginal birth within 12 hours of going to the Birthing Unit. Overall vaginal birth rates, the time from induction to delivery, and total time spent in the hospital were almost the same for both groups. However, the outpatient group felt less pain and had better sleep but were more likely need additional labor induction.

CONCLUSIONS.
Outpatient labor induction was feasible and acceptable for women who are not in a good condition to give birth naturally, however, it did not show a significant reduction in total time spent in the hospital and was associated with increased need for labor induction.

This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (RCT) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6–17 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (MMN) including zinc (451 in each group).

During early development cellular activity may be sensitive to micronutrient deficiencies, however the evidence from human studies is equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term cognitive and social-emotional effects of multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron supplementation alone, administered during infancy. This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (RCT) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6–17 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (MMN) including zinc (451 in each group). The supplementation period for both groups was six months. In 2012, a subsample of 184 children from the original cohort (now aged 36–48 months) was randomly selected to participate in a follow-up trial and was assessed for intelligence, working memory, inhibition, and executive function. The tests showed no significant differences between the supplementation groups though there were some gender differences, with girls displaying higher scores than boys across both groups on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) Verbal IQ sentences subtest, the Day-Night cognitive test and on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) social competency, and boys scoring higher than girls in problem behaviour.

Two years later, they got a random group of 184 kids from the original set to take part in another round of tests. They tested their intelligence, memory, and other brain functions, as well as their social-emotional skills. 

The results showed that the type of supplement they had as babies didn't make a difference in these areas. However, there was a noticeable difference between boys and girls. For example, girls generally had higher scores in verbal intelligence and social skills, while boys had higher scores in problem behaviour.

Effective control of postoperative pain remains one of the most important and pressing issues in the field of surgery and has a significant impact on our health care system. In too many patients, pain is treated inadequately, causing them needless suffering and they can develop complications as an indirect consequence of pain. Analgesic modalities, if properly applied, can prevent or at least minimize this needless suffering and these complications.

OBJECTIVES.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetic drugs by paravertebral and epidural routes in controlling postoperative pain in patients undergoing hip surgeries.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
The study involved 60 patients who were undergoing hip surgery under the subarachnoid block. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 patients. Group I (paravertebral group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 2.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 mL/h in the paravertebral space. Group II (epidural group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 mL/hr in the epidural space for 48 hours in the postoperative period. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, vital statistics, rescue analgesia, and procedure time were compared with the corresponding times between the 2 groups by student's t-test and repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni. P ≺ 0.05 was considered significant. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding mean pain score in the first 48 hours.

RESULTS.
Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the epidural group compared with the paravertebral group from 2 hours after start of the infusion until 48 hrs. Regional anesthesia procedure time was significantly longer in the epidural group (P ≺ 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding frequency of postoperative complications and catheter-related problems.

CONCLUSIONS.
The results of our study indicate that for patients who are scheduled for hip surgery, both continuous paravertebral and continuous epidural analgesia are effective in controlling postoperative pain but that the former has several crucial advantages.","BACKGROUND.
Controlling pain after surgery is a big challenge in the world of health care. Too many patients do not have their pain effectively controlled, which not only causes them unnecessary suffering but could also lead to other health problems. Proper use of pain relief methods can prevent or at least decrease this unnecessary suffering and these extra health issues.

OBJECTIVES.
We wanted to compare how well two different methods of giving local anesthetic drugs continuously could control pain after hip surgery. The drugs were given either beside the spinal column (paravertebral) or into the space around the spinal column (epidural).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Our study involved 60 people getting hip surgery. They were split into 2 groups of 30. One group had a single dose of spinal anesthesia plus a continuous flow of the anesthetic drug beside the spinal column. The other group had the same single dose of spinal anesthesia but a continuous flow of the drug into the space around the spinal column instead. We then compared the levels of pain, basic health measurements, need for additional pain relief, and the time taken to do the procedure between the two groups.

RESULTS.
On average, the group getting the drug into the space around the spinal column had lower blood pressure from 2 hours after the drug was started until 48 hours later. It also took longer to give the anesthetic this way. However, there were no differences in the frequency of surgical complications between the two groups or in the problems related to where the drug was given.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our study suggests that continuously giving local anesthetic beside the spinal column or into the space around it both can control pain effectively after hip surgery. However, giving it beside the spinal column might be advantageous in certain ways.",How were participants split up into the two groups?,Participants were randomly split into one of two groups.,Methods,5.1 - Experiment Protocol,,

Alirocumab undergoes target‐mediated clearance via binding of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Statins increase PCSK9 levels; the effects of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies are unclear. Every‐4‐weeks dosing of alirocumab may be appropriate for some patients in absence of background statin but is not yet approved.

METHODS AND RESULTS.
Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), PCSK9, and alirocumab levels were assessed in subjects (LDL‐C ≻130 mg/dL, n=24/group) after a 4‐week run‐in taking oral ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or ezetimibe placebo, when alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (days 1, 29, and 57) was added. Maximal mean LDL‐C reductions from day −1 baseline (prealirocumab) occurred on day 71 in all groups: alirocumab plus placebo, 47.4%; alirocumab plus ezetimibe, 56.6%; and alirocumab plus fenofibrate, 54.3%. LDL‐C reductions were sustained through day 85 with alirocumab plus placebo (47.0%); the duration of effect was slightly diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with ezetimibe (49.6%) or fenofibrate combinations (43.2%). Free PCSK9 concentrations were lowest at day 71 in all groups, then increased over time; by day 85, free PCSK9 concentrations were higher, and alirocumab levels lower, with alirocumab plus fenofibrate, and to a lesser extent alirocumab plus ezetimibe, versus alirocumab plus placebo.

CONCLUSIONS.
Alirocumab 150 mg every 4 weeks produced maximal LDL‐C reductions of 47% in combination with placebo and 54% to 57% in combination with ezetimibe or fenofibrate. The oral lipid‐lowering therapies appear to increase PCSK9 levels, leading to increased alirocumab clearance. Although the duration of effect was modestly diminished with alirocumab plus ezetimibe/fenofibrate versus placebo, the effect was less than observed in trials with background statins, and it would not preclude the use of alirocumab every 4 weeks in patients taking these nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapies concomitantly.","BACKGROUND.
This study investigates alirocumab, a drug used to lower cholesterol levels in the body. The effect of alirocumab can be influenced by other substances in the body like PCSK9, which can increase when a person is on certain medications like statins. This study examines how alirocumab operates when interacting with other cholesterol-lowering drugs that are not statins. 

METHODS AND RESULTS.
The study reported the impact of alirocumab with cholesterol-lowering substances (ezetimibe, fenofibrate) in people with high cholesterol levels. Also, how the effects of alirocumab last was assessed. They gave alirocumab to people for 4 weeks combined with other substances. The results showed that alirocumab helped in reducing cholesterol levels in the body, the decreases lifted over time, particularly when alirocumab was used with fenofibrate and ezetimibe.

CONCLUSIONS.
Overall, alirocumab was effective in reducing cholesterol when used alone or with other cholesterol-reducing substances. Even though there were slight decreases in the drug's effectiveness over time when used with ezetimibe or fenofibrate, these interactions would still allow for alirocumab to be used every 4 weeks in patients undergoing treatment with these drugs.",How did the effects of the drugs ezetimibe or fenofibrate on alirocumab compare to statin drugs?,The reduced effect of alirocumab was less significant with ezetimibe or fenofibrate compared to statin drugs.,Conclusion,6 - Results,,

Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a ubiquitous problem with serious public health implications. The fast track area is a novel method which aims to reduce waiting time, patient dissatisfaction and morbidity. |The study objective was to determine the impact of a fast track area (FTA) on both effectiveness measures (i.e. waiting times [WT] and length of stay [LOS]) and quality measures (i.e. LWBS rates and mortality rates) in non-urgent patients. The secondary objective was to assess if a FTA negatively impacted on urgent patients entering the ED.

METHODS.
The study took place in a 500 bed, urban, tertiary care hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This was a quasi-experimental, which examined the impact of a FTA on a pre-intervention control group (January 2005) (n = 4,779) versus a post-intervention study group (January 2006) (n = 5,706).

RESULTS.
Mean WTs of Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS) 4 patients decreased by 22 min (95% CI 21 min to 24 min, P ≺ 0.001). Similarly, mean WTs of CTAS 5 patients decreased by 28 min (95% CI 19 min to 37 min, P ≺ 0.001) post FTA. The mean WTs of urgent patients (CTAS 2/3) were also significantly reduced after the FTA was opened (P ≺ 0.001). The LWBS rate was reduced from 4.7% to 0.7% (95% CI 3.37 to 4.64; P ≺ 0.001). Opening a FTA had no significant impact on mortality rates (P = 0.88).

CONCLUSION.
The FTA improved ED effectiveness (WTs and LOS) and quality measures (LWBS rates) whereas mortality rate remained unchanged.","BACKGROUND.
Emergency departments (EDs) in hospitals are often crowded, which can lead to longer waiting times and unhappy patients. To solve this problem, a new method called a 'fast track area' (FTA) was tested. This method is designed to reduce the amount of time patients wait and boost their satisfaction. The study was looking to see if this new area would really help with these factors. It also checked to see if this new area would negatively affect more urgent cases in the ED.

METHODS.
The study was conducted at a 500-bed hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It compared the waiting times and satisfaction rates of two groups: one before the FTA was introduced (in January 2005) and one after (in January 2006).

RESULTS.
The results showed that after the FTA was introduced, patients rated as less urgent in the ED waited 22 minutes less, on average. The very least urgent patients waited 28 minutes less. Even the more urgent cases benefited from shorter waiting times. The number of patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) dropped significantly from 4.7% to 0.7%.

The World Health Organization stresses the importance of accessible and (cost)effective caregiver support, given the expected increase in the number of people with dementia and the detrimental impact on the mental health of family caregivers.

METHODS.
This study assessed the effectiveness of the Internet intervention 'Mastery over Dementia'. In a RCT, 251 caregivers, of whom six were lost at baseline, were randomly assigned to two groups. Caregivers in the experimental group (N = 149) were compared to caregivers who received a minimal intervention consisting of e-bulletins (N = 96). Outcomes were symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS-A). All data were collected via the Internet, and an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.

RESULTS.
Almost all caregivers were spouses or children (in-law). They were predominantly female and lived with the care recipient in the same household. Age of the caregivers varied from 26 to 87 years. Level of education varied from primary school to university, with almost half of them holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Regression analyses showed that caregivers in the experimental group showed significantly lower symptoms of depression (p = .034) and anxiety (p = .007) post intervention after adjustment for baseline differences in the primary outcome scores and the functional status of the patients with dementia. Effect sizes were moderate for symptoms of anxiety (.48) and small for depressive symptoms (.26).

CONCLUSIONS.
The Internet course 'Mastery over Dementia' offers an effective treatment for family caregivers of people with dementia reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results of this study justify further development of Internet interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia and suggest that such interventions are promising for keeping support for family caregivers accessible and affordable. The findings are even more promising because future generations of family caregivers will be more familiar with the Internet.

TRIAL REGISTRATION.
Dutch Trial Register NTR-2051 www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2051","BACKGROUND:
The World Health Organization emphasizes that support for caregivers, especially those taking care of people with dementia, should be both affordable and easy to access. This is due to the growing number of people who have dementia and the negative effects on the mental health of the family members who care for them.

METHODS:
We ran a study to see if an online program called 'Mastery over Dementia' could help. We had 251 caregivers participate, but 6 dropped out right at the beginning. The caregivers were randomly split into two groups. One group (149 people) used the online program and we compared them to the second group (96 people) who only received informational emails. We wanted to see if there was a change in signs of depression and anxiety. The caregivers answered all our questions through the internet and we made sure to include everyone's data in the final analysis.

RESULTS:
Most of the caregivers were husbands, wives, or children of the person with dementia. Most of them were women who lived in the same house as the person they were caring for. Their ages ranged from 26 to 87 and their education background varied greatly, with about half having at least a college degree. We discovered that the caregivers who used the online program had noticeably less signs of depression and anxiety after using the program.

CONCLUSIONS:
Our study shows that the 'Mastery over Dementia' online program can be a useful tool for family caregivers of people with dementia since it reduces signs of depression and anxiety. This suggests that developing more online resources like this could be beneficial for family caregivers, making support more accessible and financially manageable. This is promising for the future generations of caregivers who will likely be familiar with using the internet.

In the present study, we evaluated Se status in UK pregnant women to establish whether pre-pregnant Se status or Se supplementation affected the risk of developing PE/PIH. The samples originated from the SPRINT (Selenium in PRegnancy INTervention) study that randomised 230 UK primiparous women to treatment with Se (60 μg/d) or placebo from 12 weeks of gestation. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at 12 and 35 weeks, toenail Se concentration at 16 weeks, plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks and plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx3) activity at 12, 20 and 35 weeks. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Participants completed a FFQ. UK pregnant women had whole-blood Se concentration lower than the mid-range of other populations, toenail Se concentration considerably lower than US women, GPx3 activity considerably lower than US and Australian pregnant women, and low baseline SEPP1 concentration (median 3·00, range 0·90–5·80 mg/l). Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0·040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0·054). A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0·38, 95 % CI 0·17, 0·87, P= 0·021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0·30, 95 % CI 0·09, 1·00, P= 0·049).

Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, mucocutaneous disease of unknown etiology. The first line of treatment for oral LP (OLP) has been corticosteroids, but because of their adverse effects, alternative therapeutic approaches are being carried out, of which the recent natural alternative is propolis.

AIM.
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of topical propolis in the management of OLP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The research group consisted of 27 patients diagnosed with symptomatic OLP, among which 15 patients were in the control group and the rest 12 were in the study group. The patients in the control group received triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% (topical application) while the patients in the study group received propolis gel. Both the groups were evaluated for pain and erythema at baseline (1st visit), first follow-up (7th day), and second follow-up (14th day) using numerical rating scale and modified oral mucositis index.

RESULTS.
The patients in both the study and control groups showed a statistically significant reduction (P = 0.000 for the study group and P = 0.000 for the control group) in pain and erythema scores from baseline to second follow-up visit. However, on comparison of the reduction in pain and erythema scores between the two groups, the difference was found to be statistically insignificant (P = 0.255).

Lichen planus is a lasting skin disease that we don't know the cause of and is often treated with steroids. These steroids can have negative side effects, so researchers are trying to find other ways to treat it. Right now, they're looking into using propolis, which is a natural product created by bees.

AIM.
The goal of this study is to see if propolis can be used effectively to treat lichen planus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
The study involved 27 people who have been diagnosed with a type of lichen planus that affects the inside of the mouth. Fifteen of these people were given a common treatment (a 0.1% mix of a steroid), while the other twelve were given a gel made from propolis. Over two weeks, both groups were regularly checked for pain and redness.

RESULTS.
Both groups - those treated with steroids and those treated with propolis - showed a significant decrease in pain and redness by the end of two weeks. The decrease in these symptoms between the two groups wasn't significant enough to be conclusive.

To prospectively evaluate the effects of vitamin D3 on disease activity and quality of life in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with hypovitaminosis D.

METHODS.
The study was a prospective double-blinded, randomized trial conducted at Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno, CA from 2012–2013. Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level ≺30 ng/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups. Matched pair t-tests were computed to assess differences between the vitamin D levels, CRP, UC disease activity and SIBDQ scores before and after vitamin D3 therapy using SPSS version 21.

RESULTS.
Eight UC patients received 2,000 IU/daily and ten UC patients received 4,000 IU/daily of vitamin D3 for 90 days. Vitamin D levels increased after 90 days of oral vitamin D3 in both dose groups. However, the increase in vitamin D levels after 90 days of oral vitamin D3, in the 4,000 IU group was significantly higher 16.80 ± 9.15 (p ≺ 0.001) compared to the 2,000 IU group of vitamin D 5.00 ± 3.12 (p = 0.008). Normal vitamin D levels (≻30 ng/dl) were achieved in four out of the ten UC patients (40%) in the 4,000 IU group and in one out of the eight UC patients (12%) in the 2,000 IU group. In the group receiving 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 the increase in quality life scores (SIBDQ) was significant 1.0 ± 1.0 (p = 0.017) but not in the 2,000 IU vitamin D3 group 0.1 ± 1.0 (p = 0.87). In the 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 group the mean decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score was −0.5 ± 1.5 (p = 0.38) compared to −1.3 ± 2.9 (p = 0.19) in the 4,000 IU vitamin D3 group but this was not statistically significant. CRP levels decreased after 90 days of daily vitamin D3 in both the 2,000 IU group and 4,000 IU group by −3.0 ± 9.4 (p = 0.4) and −10.8 ± 35.0 (p = 0.36) respectively.

CONCLUSION.
Vitamin D3 at 4,000 IU/day is more effective than 2,000 IU/day in increasing vitamin D to sufficient levels in UC patients with hypovitaminosis D, however higher doses or treatment beyond ninety days may be required. Vitamin D3 may improve the quality of life in UC patients but clinically significant improvement is not yet established. The effect of vitamin D3 on UC disease activity is still unclear. Further larger studies are needed to investigate the effects of vitamin D in ulcerative colitis.","GOAL:
This study looks at whether taking vitamin D3 can affect a particular form of bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) and improve the lives of patients with low levels of vitamin D.

METHODS:
The study was carried out at a medical center in Fresno, California, between 2012 and 2013. Patients with this disease and low vitamin D levels were included. Participants were randomly given either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily for 90 days. Researchers used surveys about participant’s quality of life and a score system for disease severity. Lab tests were done and compared between the two groups. Researchers also checked if their vitamin D levels, inflammation, and scores changed before and after taking the vitamin D3.

RESULTS:
Eight patients got 2,000 IU/daily and ten got 4,000 IU/daily of vitamin D3 for three months. Vitamin D levels went up in both groups, but more so in the group taking the higher dose. Healthy vitamin D levels were reached in four out of the ten patients (40%) in the high dose group and one out of eight patients (12%) in the low dose group. The quality of life score also improved significantly in the high dose group, but not in the low dose group. The severity scores of the disease didn’t change significantly in either group. Taking vitamin D3 also seemed to lower inflammation in both groups.

CONCLUSION:
Taking 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 is more likely to increase vitamin D levels in patients with low levels of vitamin D. However, higher doses or longer time may be needed. Vitamin D3 might improve the quality of life in these patients, but it isn't proven yet. The effect on the severity of the disease is still not clear. More research is needed to better understand the impact of vitamin D in this bowel disease.",How did the change in inflammation in the high dose group compare to the low dose group?,"The 4,000 IU/day group saw an average decrease in CRP levels by 10.3mg/L, and the 2,000 IU/day group saw an average decrease of 3mg/L.",Results,6 - Results,,

Persistent neuroinflammation and disruptions in brain energy metabolism is commonly seen in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because of the lack of success of most TBI interventions and the documented benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our study on use of EE in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.

RESULTS.
Our results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, EE housing was able to restore the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mTBI.","BACKGROUND.
Brain injuries often lead to long-lasting inflammation and energy disruptions in brain activities. Despite several medical treatments, their effectiveness has been limited. However, it is known that environment enrichment (EE) - an uplifting environment - can help in boosting brain recovery. This study therefore looked into how EE can help in reducing inflammation and restoring energy balance in the brain after a minor brain injury. We conducted our study on adult male rats, which either had a minor brain injury or a fake surgery. These rats were then placed in either an EE or normal living conditions. After four weeks, we tested their cognitive abilities and measured the levels of inflammatory proteins in their brain. We also checked for levels of certain proteins that regulate brain energy balance.

RESULTS.
Our findings showed that EE: (1) reduced the inflammation-causing proteins and increased healing proteins following a minor brain injury; (2) lessened the cognitive problems caused by the minor brain injury; and (3) diminished the decline in energy regulating proteins from the minor brain injury.

CONCLUSIONS.
Our study suggests that EE can help to control persistent: (1) inflammation in the brain after a minor brain injury, and (2) the ongoing disruption in brain energy balance. Through these effects, EE could help to fix the energy imbalance and improve brain recovery after a minor injury.",Where in the brain is this study focused on?,"The study is focused on inflammation and energy disruptions in the prefrontal cortex (responsible for complex cognitive behavior like thoughts, actions and emotions) and the hippocampus (responsible for storing long-term memories).",Background,2 - Goal,,

Diabetic neuropathy is the most common diabetic complication that often is accompanied by significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The purpose of this study was evaluation of effect of Semelil (ANGIPARSTM), a new herbal drug for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers or diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

METHODS.
In this double blind clinical trial, 49 type 2 diabetes patients with different degrees of neuropathy were evaluated in two groups (ANGIPARSTM and placebo groups). All patients were assessed at the start and 12 weeks after treatment, with laboratory tests, United Kingdom screening test, Michigan neuropathy screening score, Michigan diabetic neuropathy score, vibration perception thresholds, nerve conduction study, monofilament test and visual analog scale.

RESULTS.
Michigan diabetic neuropathy score was decreased notably in ANGIPARSTM group. In the nerve conduction study, appropriate meaningful changes were observed in the distal latency and amplitude in the motor Ulnar nerve in ANGIPARSTM group.

CONCLUSION.
The results showed limited evidence of efficacy of ANGIPARSTM in diabetic neuropathy treatment and more studies with a larger sample size and longer duration are required.","WHY THE STUDY WAS DONE:
The study aimed to find out whether a new herbal medicine called Semelil (or ANGIPARSTM) has any positive effects on diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulcers are a common condition in people with diabetes, and often lead to significant health problems and costs.

HOW THE STUDY WAS DONE:
In the study, 49 people with type 2 diabetes and varying degrees of foot ulcers were divided into two groups. One group was given the new medicine and the other was given a placebo (a treatment with no active ingredient). The patients went through a series of tests before and after the study to measure the effects of the medicine.

WHAT THE STUDY FOUND:
The study found some evidence that the new medicine had a positive effect on the patients' foot ulcers. There were noticeable changes in the motor Ulnar nerve, which is one of the nerves in the arm that can be affected by diabetes.

THE STUDY'S CONCLUSIONS:
The study concluded that while the medicine had some effect, more research with larger groups of people and over longer periods of time is needed to truly gauge its effectiveness.",What kind of tests were used to assess patients in this study?,"Participants were assessed with laboratory tests, the United Kingdom screening test (a five question test to assess diabetic foot ulcers), the Michigan neuropathy screening score (a 15-item questionnaire filled out by the patient and an examination of the lower half of the body to assess diabetic foot ulcers), and the Michigan diabetic neuropathy score (which includes an exam of the nervous system and a test for how fast signals travel through the nervous system). In addition, participants were also assessed vibration perception thresholds (how well vibration is felt in the foot to determine if there is a problem with the nerves), nerve conduction study (to test for how fast signals travel through the nervous system), a monofilament test (which tests for feeling on the feet), and the visual analog scale (a numbered scale to assess pain).",Methods,5.2 - Outcome (Tool),,

Both groups of patients were given CPAP, a machine used for treating sleep apnea, for three months. The goal of the study was to see if there was a difference in the patients' sleepiness score but the study found no difference between the two groups.

We compared the haemodynamic effects of riociguat in patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or persistent/recurrent CTEPH after pulmonary endarterectomy in the Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension Soluble Guanylate Cyclase–Stimulator Trial 1 study.

METHODS.
Patients with inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH (n=261; mean± SD age 59±14 years; 66% women) were randomised to riociguat (up to 2.5 mg three times daily) or placebo. Haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and week 16.

RESULTS.
Riociguat decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in inoperable (n=189; least-squares mean difference: −285 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −357 to −213); p≺0.0001) and persistent/recurrent (n=72; −131 dyn s/cm5 (95% CI −214 to −48); p=0.0025) patients. Cardiac index improved in inoperable patients by a least-squares mean difference of +0.6 L/min/m2 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.7; p≺0.0001), while in persistent/recurrent patients the change was +0.2 L/min/m2 (95% CI −0.1 to 0.5; p=0.17).

The aim of this study was to see if the drug riociguat helped patients with a certain type of non-operable chronic lung disease.

METHODS.
We tested 261 patients (average age 59, 66% women) who had this chronic lung disease and could not have surgery or still had the disease after surgery. We gave some patients the drug riociguat and others a placebo. We tested certain indicators of heart and lung function at the start of the experiment and 16 weeks later. 

RESULTS.
We found that riociguat reduced resistance to blood flow in the lungs in both groups of patients, improving their heart's ability to pump blood. The drug also reduced blood pressure in the lungs. Furthermore, patients who showed improvement in the indicators we were testing also walked longer in a 6-minute walking test, suggesting they had better overall health.

The present study examined the effects of a balance-based exergaming intervention using the Kinect sensor on postural stability and balance in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).

METHODS.
We conducted a subject-blinded, randomized controlled study. Twenty people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I through III) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a balance-based exergaming group (N = 10) or a balance training group (N = 10) for an 8-week balance training period. Postural stability was assessed using the limits of stability (LOS) and one-leg stance (OLS) tests. Balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the timed up and go (TUG) test. Participants were assessed pre- and post-training.

RESULTS.
After training, participants in the balance-based exergaming group showed significant improvements in LOS performance, and in the eyes-closed condition of the OLS test. Both training programs led to improvements in BBS and TUG performance. Furthermore, balance-based exergaming training resulted in significantly better performance in directional control in the LOS test (78.9 ± 7.65 %) compared with conventional balance training (70.6 ± 9.37 %).

CONCLUSIONS.
Balance-based exergaming training resulted in a greater improvement in postural stability compared with conventional balance training. Our results support the therapeutic use of exergaming aided by the Kinect sensor in people with PD.

We did a study to see if a special type of exercise game, called exergaming, that uses the Kinect sensor could help improve balance and stability in people with Parkinson's disease.

METHODS.
We performed a study where the participants didn't know what group they were in, and it was all decided randomly. We had twenty people with Parkinson's disease take part. These people were either at the early, middle or later stages of the disease. Half of them were put into a group that did the Kinect exergame for balance, and the other half were put into a group that did traditional balance training. This went on for 8 weeks. We used certain tests (LOS, OLS, BBS and TUG) to measure their balance and stability before and after the training.

RESULTS.
After the training, we found that the group that did the Kinect exergame had better results in some stability tests. Both groups improved in the BBS and TUG balance tests. In one of the LOS tests, the exergaming group did much better than the traditional training group.

CONCLUSIONS.
The group that did the Kinect exergame improved more in their stability than the group that did traditional training. Our study suggests that these kind of exercise games can be helpful for people with Parkinson's disease.

Low-dose haloperidol is known to be effective for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However, precise dose-response studies have not been completed, especially in patients at high risk for PONV who require combination therapy. This study sought to identify which dose of haloperidol 1mg or 2mg could be combined with dexamethasone without adverse effects in high-risk patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery.

METHODS.
Female adults (n = 150) with three established PONV risk factors based on Apfel's score were randomized into one of three study groups. At the end of anesthesia, groups H0, H1, and H2 were given intravenous (IV) saline, haloperidol 1 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg, respectively. All patients were given dexamethasone 5 mg during the induction of anesthesia. The overall early (0–2 h) and late (2–24 h) incidences of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti-emetic administration, pain, and adverse effects (cardiac arrhythmias and extrapyramidal effects) were assessed postoperatively. The sedation score was recorded in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).

RESULTS.
The total incidence of PONV over 24 h was significantly lower in groups H1 (29 %) and H2 (24 %) than in group H0 (54 %; P = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between groups H1 and H2. In the PACU, group H2 had a higher sedation score than groups H1 and H0 (P ≺ 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS.
For high-risk PONV patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, when used with dexamethasone, 1-mg haloperidol was equally effective as 2 mg in terms of preventing PONV with the less sedative effect.

ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01639599).","BACKGROUND.
This study looked at the best dosage of a drug called haloperidol to use in combination with another drug, dexamethasone, to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery. The focus was on people who were at high risk of nausea and vomiting, specifically women having keyhole surgery on their reproductive organs.
METHODS.
The study involved 150 adult women who had a high risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. They were divided into three groups. At the end of the anesthesia, the first group was given a harmless saline solution, the second group was given 1 mg of haloperidol, and the third group was given 2 mg of haloperidol. Everyone was given 5 mg of dexamethasone when they were first put to sleep for the surgery. The researchers then kept track of nausea, vomiting, use of other medicines to stop vomiting, pain, and side effects in the next 24 hours. They also assessed how sleepy the patients were after the surgery in the recovery room.
RESULTS.
Overall, fewer people felt sick or vomited in the 24 hours after surgery in the groups given haloperidol (29% in the 1 mg group and 24% in the 2 mg group) compared to the group given saline (54%). But there was no difference in results between the 1 mg and 2 mg haloperidol groups. The people given 2 mg of haloperidol were sleepier than the others after the surgery.
CONCLUSIONS.
For women having keyhole surgery on their reproductive organs who are at high risk of feeling sick or vomiting after surgery, 1 mg of haloperidol worked just as well as 2 mg in preventing these issues when used with dexamethasone. Plus, they didn't get as sleepy with the 1 mg dose.

We examined the efficacy of olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) in improving health-related quality of life (QoL) in the treatment of bipolar depression in children and adolescents.
METHODS.
Patients aged 10–17 years with bipolar I disorder, depressed episode, baseline children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) total score ≥40, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score ≤15, and YMRS-item 1 ≤ 2 were randomized to OFC (6/25–12/50 mg/day olanzapine/fluoxetine; n = 170) or placebo (n = 85) for up to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients and parents completed the revised KINDL questionnaire for measuring health-related QoL in children and adolescents (KINDL-R) at baseline and endpoint. The mean change in CDRS-R total and item scores were used to compare improvement in symptomatology in patients taking OFC and placebo. Tests were 2-sided using a Type I error cutoff of 0.05, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
RESULTS.
Baseline QoL as measured by the KINDL-R was substantially impaired relative to published norms for a healthy school-based sample. OFC-treated patients demonstrated an improvement over placebo at endpoint with respect to mean change from baseline in the patient-rated KINDL-R Self-esteem subscale score (p = 0.028), and in the parent KINDL-R ratings of emotional well-being (p = 0.020), Self-esteem (p = 0.030), and Family (p = 0.006). At endpoint, OFC-treated patients still had a lower QoL compared to the normative population. OFC showed significant improvement (p ≤ 0.05) versus placebo on the CDRS-R total score and on 7 of the 17 CDRS-R items.
CONCLUSIONS.
Patients aged 10–17 years with an acute episode of bipolar depression and their parents reported greater improvements (parents noticed improvements in more areas than did their offspring) on some aspects of QoL when treated with OFC compared with placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, KINDL-R endpoint scores remained lower than those of the, presumably healthy, control population.

This study looked at whether a combination of two drugs, olanzapine and fluoxetine (OFC), is effective in helping improve the life quality of kids and teenagers suffering from bipolar depression. 

METHODS.
Patients between the ages of 10 and 17 who have bipolar I disorder and are currently in a depressive phase were selected for this study. These patients were then divided into two groups: one received the drug combination (OFC), and the other received a placebo (a substance with no treatment effect). They were treated for up to 8 weeks. Using a questionnaire filled out by both patients and their parents at the beginning and end of the study, we were able to measure their life quality. We also checked the degree of depression symptoms by comparing scores of specific scales before and after treatment. 

RESULTS.
At the start of the study, the patients' quality of life was much lower than what you'd expect from a healthy child or teenager of the same age. After treatment, those who received the drug combination showed improvement in how they felt about themselves and in their emotional well-being, according to both the children and their parents. The parents also noted improvements in family dynamics. However, even after treatment, these patients' quality of life remained lower than that of a typical healthy child or teenager. The group that received the drug combination also demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared to the placebo group.

Depot somatostatin analogues are well accepted as either adjuvant or primary therapy for acromegaly, and their long dosage intervals facilitate adherence to treatment. Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg, every 4–8 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1–2 weeks.

PATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.
Patients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, ≥ 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.

RESULTS.
Ninety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77·7%). Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel® than with lanreotide microparticles (3·8 (0·5) vs 4·3 (0·5) ng/ml; P ≺ 0·001). GH levels ≺ 2·5 ng/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH ≺ 2·5 ng/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide Autogel® and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide Autogel® and treatment was well accepted.

CONCLUSIONS.
Lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4–8 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7–14 days.","GOAL AND PLAN
The goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.

STUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.
We asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogel® every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.

WHAT WE FOUND.
Ninety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the Autogel® than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the Autogel® and patients were happy with the treatment.

Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a ubiquitous problem with serious public health implications. The fast track area is a novel method which aims to reduce waiting time, patient dissatisfaction and morbidity. |The study objective was to determine the impact of a fast track area (FTA) on both effectiveness measures (i.e. waiting times [WT] and length of stay [LOS]) and quality measures (i.e. LWBS rates and mortality rates) in non-urgent patients. The secondary objective was to assess if a FTA negatively impacted on urgent patients entering the ED.

METHODS.
The study took place in a 500 bed, urban, tertiary care hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. This was a quasi-experimental, which examined the impact of a FTA on a pre-intervention control group (January 2005) (n = 4,779) versus a post-intervention study group (January 2006) (n = 5,706).

RESULTS.
Mean WTs of Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS) 4 patients decreased by 22 min (95% CI 21 min to 24 min, P ≺ 0.001). Similarly, mean WTs of CTAS 5 patients decreased by 28 min (95% CI 19 min to 37 min, P ≺ 0.001) post FTA. The mean WTs of urgent patients (CTAS 2/3) were also significantly reduced after the FTA was opened (P ≺ 0.001). The LWBS rate was reduced from 4.7% to 0.7% (95% CI 3.37 to 4.64; P ≺ 0.001). Opening a FTA had no significant impact on mortality rates (P = 0.88).

CONCLUSION.
The FTA improved ED effectiveness (WTs and LOS) and quality measures (LWBS rates) whereas mortality rate remained unchanged.","BACKGROUND.
Emergency departments (EDs) in hospitals are often crowded, which can lead to longer waiting times and unhappy patients. To solve this problem, a new method called a 'fast track area' (FTA) was tested. This method is designed to reduce the amount of time patients wait and boost their satisfaction. The study was looking to see if this new area would really help with these factors. It also checked to see if this new area would negatively affect more urgent cases in the ED.

METHODS.
The study was conducted at a 500-bed hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It compared the waiting times and satisfaction rates of two groups: one before the FTA was introduced (in January 2005) and one after (in January 2006).

RESULTS.
The results showed that after the FTA was introduced, patients rated as less urgent in the ED waited 22 minutes less, on average. The very least urgent patients waited 28 minutes less. Even the more urgent cases benefited from shorter waiting times. The number of patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) dropped significantly from 4.7% to 0.7%.

The aim was to compare efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2% in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)/ocular hypertension (OHT).

SETTINGS AND DESIGN.
Open, randomized, cross-over, comparative study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Forty patients of POAG or OHT with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≺30 mm Hg were included in the study after a written informed consent. The patients were divided randomly into two groups of 20 patients each. Patients of group A were administered bimatoprost 0.03% eye drops once daily, and those of group B brimonidine 0.2% eye drops twice daily for a period of 4 weeks. After a washout period of 4 weeks, the patients were crossed over that is, group A was administered brimonidine 0.2% and group B bimatoprost 0.03%. Fall in IOP at 4 weeks was recorded. The daily cost of each drug was calculated by maximum retail price and the average number of drops per bottle. The cost-effectiveness was then calculated as the cost of drug/mm Hg fall in IOP.

STATISTICS.
Independent samples t-test was used to compare the efficacy of both drugs.

RESULTS.
IOP lowering with bimatoprost (8.9 ± 1.598 mm Hg) was significantly (P ≺ 0.0001) higher than brimonidine (6.55 ± 1.26 mm Hg). The number of drops/ml were 33.43 ± 0.52 and 25.49 ± 0.26, respectively, for bimatoprost and brimonidine. Treatment with bimatoprost was costlier than brimonidine with daily costs/eye Rs. 4.02 ± 0.06 and 3.14 ± 0.03, yearly costs/eye Rs. 1467.46 ± 20.74 and 1147.75 ± 11.15, respectively. Bimatoprost was more cost-effective than brimonidine with the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) respectively Rs. 13.10 ± 2.61/mm Hg and Rs. 13.96 ± 2.86/mm Hg. Incremental CER Rs. 10.43/mm Hg implies lower costs/mm Hg extra IOP lowering by bimatoprost than Rs. 13.96 for brimonidine.

CONCLUSION.
In spite of being costlier, bimatoprost is more efficacious and cost-effective than brimonidine.","GOAL:
We wanted to see if two particular eye drops, bimatoprost 0.03% and brimonidine 0.2%, work well and are good value for money for people with a specific eye condition causing increased eye pressure (called primary open-angle glaucoma) or high eye pressure (ocular hypertension).

HOW WE DID IT:
We carried out a study involving 40 volunteers who had these conditions but only mild eye pressure. We randomly divided them into two different groups. Half of them were given bimatoprost drops once a day, while the other half used brimonidine drops twice a day, for a month. After resting for a month, we switched the groups: the first group started using brimonidine, and the second group used bimatoprost. We recorded the drop in eye pressure after a month for both groups. We then calculated the cost per day of both treatments, and how much it cost per unit of pressure dropped (cost-effectiveness).

HOW WE FIGURED OUT THE RESULTS:
We used a common statistical method to compare how effective both drugs were.

RESULTS:
We found that bimatoprost was significantly more effective, reducing eye pressure more than brimonidine. However, bimatoprost was also more expensive on a per drop basis than brimonidine. Despite the higher price, when looking at the cost in relation to how much it lowers eye pressure, bimatoprost ended up being a more cost-effective option than brimonidine.

CONCLUSION:
Although it's a bit more expensive, bimatoprost is more effective and gives you more bang for your buck than brimonidine when it comes to treating these eye conditions.",How many drops were in a bottle of bimatoprost compared to brimonidine?,"Bimatoprost had an average number of 33.43 drops per bottle, while brimonidine had an average of 25.49 drops per bottle.",Results,5.4 - Quantity,,

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (N=301 smokers) tested 200 and 400 μg doses administered 4 or 5 times over 6 months compared to placebo. 3'AmNic-rEPA recipients with the highest serum anti-nicotine antibody response (top 30% by AUC) were significantly more likely to attain 8 weeks continuous abstinence from weeks 19 through 26 than the placebo recipients (24.6% vs. 12.0%, p=0.024, OR=2.69, 95% CI, 1.14–6.37). The 5 injection 400 μg dose regimen had the greatest antibody response and had significantly higher abstinence rates than placebo. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept that 3'AmNic-rEPA elicits antibodies to nicotine and is associated with higher continuous abstinence rates, justifying its further development as a treatment for nicotine dependence.","Scientists have been testing a new nicotine vaccine, called NicVAX®, to see if it can help smokers quit. They wanted to know if more of the vaccine in the body leads to better quit rates and if giving more doses of the vaccine increases its effectiveness.

They conducted a study with 301 smokers, where some received either 200 or 400 μg doses of the vaccine, four or five times over six months, and others received a fake form of the vaccine (placebo). They found out that those who had the most significant immune response to the vaccine (the top 30%) were more likely to quit smoking for at least eight weeks compared to those who took the placebo (24.6% vs. 12.0%).

Interestingly, those who had the regimen of five shots of the higher dose (400 μg) were more likely to quit smoking than the placebo group too.

The aim of this study was to compare the formation of dentinal crack and craze lines in the root dentin during root canal preparation with three different NiTi endodontic systems, naming Reciproc (RCP), ProTaper Universal (PTU) and Mtwo.

METHODS AND MATERIALS.
One hundred extracted mandibular premolars with single canals were selected and decoronated. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 25 each (n=25). In groups 1, 2 and 3 the teeth were prepared using Mtwo, PTU and RCP, respectively. While in group 4 (control group) the samples were left unprepared. After preparation, all specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of root at 3, 5 and 9-mm distances from the apex. The sections were then individually observed under 12× magnification using stereomicroscope. The data was analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. The level of significance was set at 0.05.

RESULTS.
No cracks were observed in the control group. All engine-driven systems caused dentinal cracks. Mtwo and PTU caused cracks significantly more than RCP (P≺0.05). There was no significant difference between RCP and control group (P≻0.05).

CONCLUSION.
All three engine-driven systems created dentinal defects. Reciproc caused less cracks than Mtwo and ProTaper Universal.","INTRODUCTION.
This study looked at possible damage to teeth (called ""dentinal cracks and craze lines"") during root canal treatments using three different dental tools.

A hundred human premolars (kind of teeth) with single canals were used. They were grouped into four sets of 25 each. Teeth in the first three groups were treated with one of the three dental tools each. The last group's teeth were left untreated as a control. After these treatments, parts of the teeth were cut and examined under a microscope. The gathered data was then statistically analysed.

RESULTS.
The control group of untreated teeth showed no cracks. All the treatment methods caused some cracks. Two of the tools, Mtwo and ProTaper Universal, caused significantly more cracks than the third tool, Reciproc which didn't cause significantly more cracks than the untreated group.

Patients with glaucoma who do not keep their follow-up eye care appointments are at risk for developing more severe ocular disease. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the use of a patient navigator altered adherence to follow-up eye care appointments in community-versus office-based settings.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Patients diagnosed with a glaucoma-related condition following a comprehensive eye examination at 43 community sites in Philadelphia, PA, USA, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized into three groups for a 1-year period: Group 1 (G1) received follow-up eye care in a community-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; Group 2 (G2) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting with assistance from a patient navigator; and Group 3 (G3) received follow-up eye care in an office-based setting without a patient navigator (usual care). Adherence rates were compared among these three groups using a chi-squared test at a significance level of 0.05.

RESULTS.
A total of 155 patients with glaucoma-related diagnoses were enrolled. The mean age (±standard deviation) was 71.2 (±10.0) years. Patients were predominantly female (65.8%, n=102/155) and African-American (71.6%, n=111/155). The mean (±standard deviation) number of follow-up visits during the 1-year study period was 1.3 (±1.3) for G1, 1.6 (±1.3) for G2, and 1.3 (±1.1) for G3 (P=0.48). Appointment adherence, defined as attendance of ≥1 follow-up visit, was 69.8% (n=37/53) for G1, 82.5% (n=47/57) for G2, and 73.3% (n=33/45) for G3, (P=0.28). Sub-analysis of adherence rates for patients who attended ≥2 follow-up visits were 91.3% (n=21/23) for G1, 74.3% (n=26/35) for G2, and 66.7% (n=18/27) for G3, (P=0.11).

CONCLUSION.
Help from a patient navigator did not increase the likelihood of keeping ≥1 follow-up appointment in an office-based setting. Adherence rates for follow-up appointments reached close to 70% or above in a self-selected patient population.","PURPOSE.
This study looked at how having a 'patient navigator' - a person who helps guide a patient through their healthcare journey - could change how regularly patients with glaucoma go to their follow-up eye check-ups. This is important because missed appointments can lead to worse vision problems. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS. 
The study used people who were diagnosed with some form of glaucoma after taking an eye test in Philadelphia, USA. These people were put into three groups for one year: one group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator, the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator, and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator. Then, they compared how well each group stuck to their appointment schedule. 

RESULTS.
155 patients were included in this study. They were generally around 71 years old, mostly women, and primarily African-American. The number of follow-up visits during the year was about the same between the three groups. Around 70% to 82% of patients in all groups attended at least one follow-up visit. When looking at only the people who attended two or more follow-up visits, the group with a patient navigator within the community had the highest turn out. 

CONCLUSION.
Even though having a patient navigator didn't make people more likely to go to an office for their check-ups, people did have a decent rate of attendance at their follow-up visits on their own. It is unclear if the community-based care with a navigator helped with the higher rate of attendance for two or more check-ups, which suggests more study is needed.",How were the groups compared in how well they stuck to their appointment schedule?,Researchers used a chi-squared test to determine if the difference in adherence rates between the three groups is due to chance or because of either the setting or the patient navigator.,Methods,5.3 - Analysis Technique,,

Due to increasing resistance to antibiotics and rising incidence of oral diseases, there is a need for alternative treatment modalities to combat oral diseases. The aim of the present study was to access the effect of Aloe vera mouthwash on the dental plaque in the experimental period of 4 days and to compare it with the bench mark control chlorhexidine and placebo (saline water).

MATERIAL AND METHODS.
A total of 300 systemically healthy subjects were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Aloe vera mouthwash group (n=100), control group (=100)-chlorhexidene group and saline water-Placebo (n=100). To begin with, Gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were recorded. Then, baseline plaque scores were brought to zero by professionally cleaning the teeth with scaling and polishing. After randomization of the participants into three groups they were refrained from regular mechanical oral hygiene measures. Subjects were asked to swish with respective mouthwash (Aloe vera mouthwash, 0.2%chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, or normal saline) as per therapeutic dose for 4 days.

RESULTS.
The results showed that Aloe vera mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing plaque as Chlorhexidine compared to placebo over a period of 4 days. There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them (p≻0.05). Aloe vera mouthwash showed no side effects.

CONCLUSION.
The results of the present study indicated that Aloe vera may prove an effective mouthwash due to its ability in reducing dental plaque.","BACKGROUND.
There's a growing problem with antibiotics not working as effectively, and more people are experiencing oral diseases. This study was to see if Aloe vera mouthwash could help with oral health issues, particularly dental plaque. Specifically, we wanted to see how Aloe vera mouthwash worked over four days, compared to the usual mouthwash (chlorhexidine) and a mouthwash that isn't supposed to do anything (saline water).

Material and Methods.
300 healthy volunteers were split into three equal groups. One group used Aloe vera mouthwash, another used chlorhexidine mouthwash (the usual stuff), and the third used saline water (which doesn't do anything). At the start, we tested the health of everyone's gums (ginigval index) and how much plaque they had (plaque index). We then cleaned everyone's teeth professionally so everyone started with no plaque. For the next four days, the volunteers only used their assigned mouthwash, without brushing or flossing. 

RESULTS.
The study found that both the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash were equally good at reducing plaque over those four days. Meanwhile, the saline water didn't do much (as expected). The difference in plaque reduction between the Aloe vera mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash wasn't significant enough to matter. Also, no one reported any bad side effects from the Aloe vera mouthwash.

CONCLUSION.
Based on this study, Aloe vera could be a good alternative mouthwash. It was successful in reducing dental plaque, just as effective as the usual chlorhexidine mouthwash, but without any side effects.",How were the volunteers split into the three groups?,The volunteers were randomly assigned one of three groups.,Methods,5.1 - Experiment Protocol,,

The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).
METHODS.
Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, COCs (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) VS1 group: COCs were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (VS1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [EG] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 20% calf serum [CS] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) VS1 + VS2 group: COCs were exposed to VS1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% EG + 15% DMSO + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: COCs were exposed to VS1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% CS at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, COCs (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in VS1, VS1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all COCs in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.
RESULTS.
Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution. However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P ≺ 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, VS1 and VS1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).
CONCLUSIONS.
The permeating cryoprotectants (EG and DMSO) present in VS1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine COCs. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.","BACKGROUND
This study checked how deep freezing (vitrification) and other related factors affect the growth and development of immature cow egg cells (also called COCs).

METHODS
We did two experiments. In the first experiment, we had 420 COCs separated into four groups: Group 1 received no treatment. Group 2 was exposed to a special freezing mixture for 5 minutes. Group 3 got the same freeze mix, then a second mix for 45-60 seconds. Group 4 went through the same steps as group 3, but these COCs were also fast-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then warmed up quickly. In the second experiment, we treated 581 COCs the same way but also had some of the COCs from groups 2, 3 and 4 spend either 1 or 5 minutes in a warming solution. All COCs from both experiments were then grown and fertilized in a lab.

RESULTS
We noticed that the rate at which the COCs grew and developed was the same for groups 1, 2 and 3, no matter how long they spent in the warming solution. But for the group 4 COCs—the ones that had been fast-frozen and heated up again—their growth and development rates were much lower.

CONCLUSIONS
We concluded that the freezing mixes and the time spent in the warming solution did not negatively affect the COCs. The fast-freezing and quick warming, however, did decrease how well these cow egg cells grew and developed.",How were the cow egg cells in group 4 warmed up?,"The cow egg cells in group 4, after being frozen in liquid nitrogen, were warmed in a solution of TCM-199 (a solution to help artificial growth of the egg cells) plus 17.1% sucrose (sugar) plus 20% cow serum (a growth supplement for the egg cells) at 37 degrees Celsius for 1 minute.",Methods,5 - Method,,

Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) uses feedback from brain signals to guide stimulation. A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.

METHODS.
We applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of β activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0±0.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.

RESULTS.
UPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS.

CONCLUSION.
Bilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states.","INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.
This research is about a deep brain stimulation method, known as adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), where we use feedback from the brain to guide the process. From previous trials, we saw that aDBS had a strong positive impact on people with Parkinson's disease. Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.

METHODS.
We used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.

RESULTS. 
The treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.

CONCLUSION.
So, we conclude that using aDBS on both sides of the brain improves certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It's also able to adjust to the need for stimulation in patients taking medication.",What additional improvements did the medication Levodopa have?,The medication Levodopa reduced the total time treatment was used even more.,Results,6 - Results,,

Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery.

METHODS.
In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g · kg−1 · d−1) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g · kg−1 · d−1) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children ≺24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-13C]valine infusion. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.

RESULTS.
Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol · kg−1 · min−1 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (−0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (−0.20 to 0.63) μmol · kg−1 · min−1 in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein.

CONCLUSIONS.
It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

TRIAL REGISTRATION.
Dutch Trial Register NTR2334.","BACKGROUND.
Babies who have heart surgery may not get enough protein. This is because having surgery and using a heart-lung machine during the operation might break down protein faster than normal, and these babies might not eat enough to replace it. This study was done to see how giving these babies more protein after surgery would affect their protein levels.

METHODS.
We conducted a study where we randomly chose some babies to get a lot of protein and some to get a normal amount. This was done on the second day after they had surgery to fix heart defects they were born with. We did a special test to measure how much of a kind of protein called ""valine"" their bodies were making. We also measured how much of another protein called ""albumin"" their bodies were making. We then compared the results between the two groups.

RESULTS.
28 babies, who were around 9 months old and weighed about 7 kg, took part in the study. However, we could only use the data from 20 of them for our final results. Because we didn't have enough data, we couldn't make conclusions about protein levels. There was no difference in albumin production between the two groups. However, we saw that the babies getting a lot of protein had higher levels of valine and another substance called BUN, which is an indicator of how much protein a person is getting.

CONCLUSIONS.
It looks like the extra protein in the diet of the high-protein group might have increased the levels of valine and BUN. However, because we didn't have enough data, we can't say for sure that a high-protein diet would change protein levels in these babies. Therefore, the results from our study should be taken as a starting point for further research.

Many drug users present to primary care requesting detoxification from illicit opiates. There are a number of detoxification agents but no recommended drug of choice. The purpose of this study is to compare buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for detoxification from illicit opiates in primary care.

METHODS.
Open label randomised controlled trial in NHS Primary Care (General Practices), Leeds, UK. Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six months post detoxification were recorded.

RESULTS.
Only 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription. Risk of non-completion of detoxification was reduced if allocated buprenorphine (68% vs 88%, RR 0.58 CI 0.35–0.96, p = 0.065). A higher proportion of people allocated to buprenorphine provided a clean urine sample compared with those who received dihydrocodeine (21% vs 3%, RR 2.06 CI 1.33–3.21, p = 0.028). People allocated to buprenorphine had fewer visits to professional carers during detoxification and more were abstinent at three months (10 vs 4, RR 1.55 CI 0.96–2.52) and six months post detoxification (7 vs 3, RR 1.45 CI 0.84–2.49).

CONCLUSION.
Informative randomised trials evaluating routine care within the primary care setting are possible amongst drug using populations. This small study generates unique data on commonly used treatment regimens.","BACKGROUND:
Many drug users go to their regular doctors asking for help to stop using illegal drugs. There are many medicines available to help with this, but no one is sure which is the best. This study compares two drugs, buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine, to see which is better at helping people stop using illegal drugs.

METHODS:
This study included 60 adults in Leeds, UK, who were using illegal drugs and wanted to stop. They were randomly chosen to receive either buprenorphine or dihydrocodeine. The way the drugs were reduced over time depended on what the prescribing doctor thought was best, but it was not supposed to be more than 15 days. The main goal was to see if the person stopped using illegal drugs by the end of the treatment, which was checked by a urine test. They also looked at what happened during the treatment and three and six months afterwards.

RESULTS:
Only 23% of the people finished their drug detox treatment and gave a urine sample at the end. If people were given buprenorphine, they were more likely to finish the detox treatment. Those given buprenorphine were also more likely to have a clean urine sample, meaning they stopped using illegal drugs. They also needed to see healthcare professionals less often during treatment and more were still not using drugs three and six months later.

Butylphthalide sodium chloride injection for patients with acute cerebral infarction has a certain effect. Although there are several proposed mechanisms of drug action, no related research on improving the inflammatory cytokines that regulate the body’s immune system through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis has been published.

OBJECTIVE.
To determine the impact of butylphthalide and sodium chloride injection on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after acute cerebral infarction in the basal ganglia.

METHODS.
Patients were randomly divided into treatment and control groups; the treatment group received intravenous drips of butylphthalide, while the control group did not. The levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (COR), along with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of both groups were detected using the radioimmunoassay method. This was done at regular intervals after cerebral infarction in the basal ganglia was detected.

RESULTS.
Fourteen days after treatment, the levels of serum ACTH and COR in both groups were higher than normal. The NIHSS score and levels of ACTH and COR of the treatment group were significantly lower than those of the control group (p≺0.05). The data was computed and analyzed using SPSS17.0 software.

CONCLUSION.
Butylphthalide treatment for patients suffering from acute basal ganglia infarction can reduce the adverse effects on the HPA axis, thus improving patient prognosis.","BACKGROUND.
We know that a medicine called butylphthalide sodium chloride injection can help people who've just had a certain type of stroke, but we don't know exactly how it works. We think it might help reduce inflammation and boost the immune system by affecting a particular group of glands in the body (the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands).

OBJECTIVE.
We want to see what effect this medicine has on these glands when given to people who've just had this type of stroke.

METHODS.
We split patients into two groups: one got the medicine through an IV drip and the other didn't. We then measured their hormone levels and used a standard test to check on their stroke symptoms. We did this a few times after they had the stroke.

RESULTS.
After two weeks, we found that both groups had higher than normal levels of two specific hormones. However, the group who got the medicine had lower levels of these hormones and better scores on the stroke test than the group who didn't get the medicine.

CONCLUSION.
Giving this medicine to people who've just had this type of stroke can improve their condition by lessening the negative impacts on these glands in the body.",What hormones were measured for this study?,This study measured levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (which produces the hormone cortisol) and levels of cortisol (which helps regulate stress).,Methods,2 - Goal,,

Depot somatostatin analogues are well accepted as either adjuvant or primary therapy for acromegaly, and their long dosage intervals facilitate adherence to treatment. Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg, every 4–8 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1–2 weeks.

PATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.
Patients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, ≥ 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.

RESULTS.
Ninety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77·7%). Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel® than with lanreotide microparticles (3·8 (0·5) vs 4·3 (0·5) ng/ml; P ≺ 0·001). GH levels ≺ 2·5 ng/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH ≺ 2·5 ng/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide Autogel® and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide Autogel® and treatment was well accepted.

CONCLUSIONS.
Lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4–8 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7–14 days.","GOAL AND PLAN
The goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.

STUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.
We asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogel® every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.

WHAT WE FOUND.
Ninety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the Autogel® than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the Autogel® and patients were happy with the treatment.

CONCLUSIONS.
Using lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks works just as well and is as well tolerated as using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every one to two weeks in treating acromegaly.",How did levels of growth hormone with the Autogel compare to the levels with the microparticles?,"Average levels of growth hormone were 3.8 ng/ml compared to 4.3 ng/ml for the microparticles.

To compare the short term effects of bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections on the regression of corneal neovascularization (NV).

METHODS.
Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with corneal NV were randomly assigned for an injection with 2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1, n = 8) or 1 mg of ranibizumab (group 2, n = 8) through subconjunctival and intrastromal routes. The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal NV areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal NV areas were compared before and after the injections.

RESULTS.
Seven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal NV secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). In group I, the preoperative corneal NV area (8.75 ± 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 ± 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 ± 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). The corneal NV area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 ± 4.33% to 6.72 ± 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal NV area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 ± 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 ± 11.64%, p = 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS.
Bevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal NV compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal NV require further investigation.","PURPOSE.
This study aims to compare the short-term effects of two kinds of injections, namely, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, on the shrinking of unusual blood vessels in the cornea (the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the eye).

METHODS.
Sixteen patients suffering from abnormal blood vessels in the cornea were randomly chosen to receive one of either a bevacizumab or ranibizumab injection. They were checked before the injection, a week after the injection, and a month after the injection to measure how much their blood vessels shrunk. 

RESULTS.
The patients, aged around 51, developed abnormal blood vessels in the cornea due to various reasons like eye infections or chemical burns. After the bevacizumab injection, a clear reduction in unusual blood vessels was noticed both a week and a month after the treatment. The ranibizumab injection also resulted in reduced abnormal vessels after a week, but the change was not significant a month later. In group 1, treated with bevacizumab, the shrinkage in unusual vessels was significantly higher than in group 2, treated with ranibizumab.

CONCLUSIONS.

Propofol (2, 6-di-isopropylphenol) used for the induction of anaesthesia often causes mild to severe pain or discomfort on injection. We designed this double-blind study to compare the efficacy of methylprednisolone and lignocaine in reducing the pain of propofol injection in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.

METHODS.
A total of 165 adult patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were divided into three groups: saline (group S, n = 55), lignocaine 20 mg (Group L, n = 55) and methylprednisolone 125 mg diluted into 2 ml of distilled water (Group MP, n = 55). Drugs were administered after tourniquet application and occlusion was released after 1 min and 1/4th of the total dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) was administered at the rate of 0.5 ml/s. Pain on propofol injection was evaluated by four-point verbal rating scale. Statistical methods used included Student's t-test and Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test.

RESULTS.
The overall incidence of pain was 70.9% in the saline group, 30.9% in the lignocaine group and 36.4% in the methylprednisolone group. The intensity of pain was significantly less in patients receiving methylprednisolone and lignocaine than those receiving saline (P ≺ 0.012).

CONCLUSION.
Pre-treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was found to be as effective as lignocaine in reducing propofol injection-induced pain.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The drug Propofol, often used to put people to sleep before surgeries, can sometimes cause mild to severe pain when injected. In our study, we wanted to see if adding two different drugs, methylprednisolone and lignocaine, could reduce this pain. We tested this on patients about to undergo heart surgery.

WHAT WE DID
We had 165 adult patients who were going to have non-emergency heart surgery. We split them into three groups: one group was given a harmless saline solution (55 people), one was given 20 mg of lignocaine (55 people), and the last was given 125 mg of methylprednisolone (also 55 people). We administered the drugs after applying a tourniquet and let it stay for 1 min before giving 1/4th of the typical Propofol dose. We then asked the patients to rate their pain when the Propofol was injected.

RESULTS
About 71% of the patients given only the saline solution experienced pain. For the group given lignocaine, the pain was reduced to about 31%. And for those given methylprednisolone, the pain was further lowered to about 36%. The added drugs significantly reduced the pain when compared to just the saline solution (we used statistical tests to confirm this).

WHAT WE CONCLUDED
Adding the drug methylprednisolone to Propofol before surgery was as effective as adding lignocaine in reducing the pain of the injection.",How does this study control for bias?,"The study is double-blind, so neither the researchers nor the participants know which treatment each patient gets.",Background,5.1 - Experiment Protocol,,

Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) uses feedback from brain signals to guide stimulation. A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.

METHODS.
We applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of β activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0±0.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.

RESULTS.
UPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%. Levodopa was well tolerated during aDBS and led to further reductions in ToS.

CONCLUSION.
Bilateral aDBS can improve both axial and limb symptoms and can track the need for stimulation across drug states.","INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES.
This research is about a deep brain stimulation method, known as adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), where we use feedback from the brain to guide the process. From previous trials, we saw that aDBS had a strong positive impact on people with Parkinson's disease. Now, we wanted to check if these benefits can be achieved with bilateral aDBS (applied to both sides of the brain) when the patient is also on medication.

METHODS.
We used this therapy on 4 Parkinson's patients. The aDBS therapy was administered to both sides of their brains independently, depending on the level of their brain activity. We primarily looked at how this treatment affected the patients' movement and coordination, measured using a specific scoring system.

RESULTS. 
The treatment, aDBS, lead to a 43% improvement in the patients' coordination and movement scores. Interestingly, the improvements observed were achieved even though the treatment was used only 45% of the time. Furthermore, the commonly used Parkinson's disease medication (Levodopa) worked well with aDBS, leading to additional improvements.

CONCLUSION.
So, we conclude that using aDBS on both sides of the brain improves certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It's also able to adjust to the need for stimulation in patients taking medication.",What type of active deep brain stimulation was used in previous trials?,Previous trials found a positive impact of unilateral (only applied to one side of the brain) active deep brain stimulation on symptoms of Parkinson's disease.,Background,3 - Usual treatment,,

A population of breast cancer patients exists who, for various reasons, never received adjuvant post-operative tamoxifen (TAM). This study was aimed to evaluate the role of late TAM in these patients.

METHODS.
From 1997 to 2003, patients aged 35 to 75 years, operated more than 2 years previously for monolateral breast cancer without adjuvant TAM, with no signs of metastases and no contraindication to TAM were randomized to TAM 20 mg/day orally for 2 years or follow-up alone. Events were categorized as locoregional relapse, distant metastases, metachronous breast cancer, tumours other than breast cancer and death from any causes, whichever occurred first. The sample size (197 patients per arm, plus 10% allowance) was based on the assumption of a 30% decrease in the number of events occurring at a rate of 5% annually in the 10 years following randomization. Four hundred and thirty-three patients were randomized in the study (TAM 217, follow-up 216). Patients characteristics (TAM/follow-up) included: median age 55/55 years, median time from surgery 25/25 months (range, 25-288/25-294), in situ carcinoma 18/24, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive in 75/68, negative in 70/57, unknown in 72/91 patients. Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 month, mostly because of subjective intolerance. Eighty-three events (TAM 39, follow-up 44) occurred: locoregional relapse in 10/8, distant metastases in 14/16, metachronous breast cancer in 4/10, other tumours in 11/10 patients. Less ER-positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than in follow-up patients (1 vs 10, p = 0.005). Event-free survival was similar in both groups of patients.

CONCLUSIONS.
This 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous ER-positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients. No other statistically significant differences have emerged thus far.","BACKGROUND.
This study looked at breast cancer patients who, for different reasons, didn't receive a common follow-up treatment called Tamoxifen after their surgery. The aim was to see what role, if any, Tamoxifen could still play for these patients if given later.

METHODS.
Between 1997 and 2003, we looked at patients aged 35-75 who had had surgery for one-sided breast cancer more than 2 years before. These patients didn't have any signs of the cancer spreading and were healthy enough to take Tamoxifen. They were split into two groups: one received 20 mg/day of Tamoxifen for two years, and the other did not. We tracked various outcomes including local and distant cancer recurrence, new breast cancers, other types of cancer, and death. We based our sample size on the hypothesis that taking Tamoxifen would result in 30% fewer events occurring over 10 years. The study included 433 people, 217 took Tamoxifen while 216 did not. The patient's characteristics were very similar in both groups.

RESULTS.
Thirty-six patients stopped taking Tamoxifen after about a month, mainly due to not tolerating it well. Eighty-three significant events occurred: 10 local and 16 distant cancer recurrences, 14 new breast cancers, and 21 other cancers. In the Tamoxifen group, fewer patients developed new estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers (1 vs 10). However, the two groups showed similar overall health progress.

Effective control of postoperative pain remains one of the most important and pressing issues in the field of surgery and has a significant impact on our health care system. In too many patients, pain is treated inadequately, causing them needless suffering and they can develop complications as an indirect consequence of pain. Analgesic modalities, if properly applied, can prevent or at least minimize this needless suffering and these complications.

OBJECTIVES.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetic drugs by paravertebral and epidural routes in controlling postoperative pain in patients undergoing hip surgeries.

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
The study involved 60 patients who were undergoing hip surgery under the subarachnoid block. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 patients. Group I (paravertebral group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 2.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 mL/h in the paravertebral space. Group II (epidural group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 mL/hr in the epidural space for 48 hours in the postoperative period. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, vital statistics, rescue analgesia, and procedure time were compared with the corresponding times between the 2 groups by student's t-test and repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni. P ≺ 0.05 was considered significant. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding mean pain score in the first 48 hours.

RESULTS.
Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the epidural group compared with the paravertebral group from 2 hours after start of the infusion until 48 hrs. Regional anesthesia procedure time was significantly longer in the epidural group (P ≺ 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding frequency of postoperative complications and catheter-related problems.

CONCLUSIONS.
The results of our study indicate that for patients who are scheduled for hip surgery, both continuous paravertebral and continuous epidural analgesia are effective in controlling postoperative pain but that the former has several crucial advantages.","BACKGROUND.
Controlling pain after surgery is a big challenge in the world of health care. Too many patients do not have their pain effectively controlled, which not only causes them unnecessary suffering but could also lead to other health problems. Proper use of pain relief methods can prevent or at least decrease this unnecessary suffering and these extra health issues.

OBJECTIVES.
We wanted to compare how well two different methods of giving local anesthetic drugs continuously could control pain after hip surgery. The drugs were given either beside the spinal column (paravertebral) or into the space around the spinal column (epidural).

PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Our study involved 60 people getting hip surgery. They were split into 2 groups of 30. One group had a single dose of spinal anesthesia plus a continuous flow of the anesthetic drug beside the spinal column. The other group had the same single dose of spinal anesthesia but a continuous flow of the drug into the space around the spinal column instead. We then compared the levels of pain, basic health measurements, need for additional pain relief, and the time taken to do the procedure between the two groups.

RESULTS.
On average, the group getting the drug into the space around the spinal column had lower blood pressure from 2 hours after the drug was started until 48 hours later. It also took longer to give the anesthetic this way. However, there were no differences in the frequency of surgical complications between the two groups or in the problems related to where the drug was given.

Disabled multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often need intervention of multiple specialists, resulting in a complex organization of care. How this multidisciplinary care should be organized and structured has not been studied.

OBJECTIVE.
The objective of this article is to address the effectiveness of an integrated multidisciplinary approach versus usual care in MS patients.

METHODS.
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients. Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care. The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.

RESULTS.
Fifty MS patients were included. Median MSIS 29 score decreased over six months in the control group (−4.89) and increased in the IMD group (+2.00), with a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.03). However, in the multivariate analysis, after adjustment of HAD-D and INTERMED score, this difference was no longer significant.

CONCLUSIONS.
This prospective, randomized study is the first attempt to evaluate the multidisciplinary approach in MS patients. The results show that, contrary to our expectations, an integrated multidisciplinary approach is not superior to usual care on QoL.","BACKGROUND.
People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often require care from many different doctors, which can create a complex system for managing their health. We don't yet know the best way to organize this type of team-based care.

OBJECTIVE.
This study aims to find out if coordinating these multiple specialists in an integrated approach is more effective than the regular forms of care for MS patients.

METHODS.
We conducted a study with MS patients, comparing two different methods of care. The first method was a new, integrated team approach where the patients would spend a half-day at the MS clinic going through a comprehensive personal health assessment. The second method was the normal standard of care. We looked at how these two methods affected patients' quality of life (QoL), which was measured with a specific scale, at the start of the trial and after six months.

RESULTS.
We involved 50 MS patients in our study. At the end of six months, the regular care group's quality of life score decreased a little, while the integrated care group's quality of life score increased a little. This difference looked significant at first glance. But, when we adjusted for other variables, the difference didn't stand out.

Eighteen subjects (11 male and 7 female, aged 7.8–18.2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or etanercept. Inclusion criteria included age 3–18 years, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity, A1C ≻6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell count 3,000–10,000, platelets ≻100,000, and normal liver and renal function. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.

RESULTS.
A1C at week 24 was lower in the etanercept group (5.91 ± 0.5%) compared with that in the placebo group (6.98 ± 1.2%; P ≺ 0.05) with a higher percent decrease from baseline than in the placebo group (etanercept 0.41 ± 0.1 vs. placebo 0.18 ± 0.21; P ≺ 0.01). The percent change in C-peptide area under the curve from baseline to week 24 showed a 39% increase in the etanercept group and a 20% decrease in the placebo group (P ≺ 0.05). From baseline to week 24 insulin dose decreased 18% in the etanercept group compared with a 23% increase in the placebo group (P ≺ 0.05). Seventeen patients completed the study, and none withdrew because of adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS.
In this small pilot study, treatment of pediatric patients newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with etanercept resulted in lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of β-cell function. A larger study is needed to further explore safety and efficacy.","GOAL.
The goal of this study was to test if a drug called etanercept could help children with newly detected type 1 diabetes continue making their own insulin for longer.

STUDY DESIGN. 
This was a six-month experiment carried out at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo's Diabetes Center. A diverse group of 18 kids aged between 7.8-18.2 years participated. They were randomly split into two groups. One group received etanercept, and the other got a placebo (a substance with no therapeutic effect). The researchers used standard criteria, including age, health status, insulin injections, and general health markers to select the participants. They treated all participants equally whether they finished the study or not.

FINDINGS. 
At the end of the study, the group that received etanercept had a lower average blood sugar level and seemed to be making more of their own insulin than the placebo group. Their average insulin dose decreased by 18%, while the placebo group's average dose increased by 23%. Importantly, none of the patients dropped out due to side effects from the etanercept.

CONCLUSIONS. 
This small preliminary study suggests that etanercept might help children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes maintain their ability to produce insulin. Therefore, etanercept might delay the point at which patients need to rely entirely on insulin injections. More extensive research is needed to confirm this possibility and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this treatment approach.",What was the inclusion criteria?,"Participants included were between 3 and 18 years old, GAD-65 and/or islet cell antibody positivity (positive for antibodies that indicate an autoimmune disease), A1C (blood sugar level) >6%, three insulin injections per day, white blood cell (a part of the immune system) count 3,000 - 10,000, platelets (cells that form blood clots) >100,000, and normal liver and renal (kidney) function.",Methods,1.1 - Inclusion Criteria,,
