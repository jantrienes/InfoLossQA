Etanercept works by blocking the action of a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which is involved in the immune system's attack on the beta cells. By blocking TNF-alpha, etanercept helps to reduce inflammation and preserve beta cell function, which can help to improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of complications associated with type 1 diabetes.","predicted_highlighted":"<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Open Sans,Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;\">OBJECTIVE.\nTo gather preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">etanercept therapy<\/span> to prolong endogenous insulin production in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.\nThis was a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at the Diabetes Center, Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo.
