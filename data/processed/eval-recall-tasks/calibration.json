Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 \u00b1 2, 50 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.\n\nRESULTS.\nBIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.</pre>", "score": 0.06117168813943863, "bin": "(0.05, 0.1]"}, {"doc_id": 2556743, "model_name": "mistral-7b-instruct-one-shot", "reference_id": "22819c0f68725b12f466e161143f936c", "prediction_id": "f353874c57271014848ccd985af6b46e", "reference_question": "What type of major surgeries were being noted in the research?", "reference_answer": "High-risk surgeries.", "reference_highlighted": "<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Open Sans,Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;\">INTRODUCTION.\nSeveral studies have shown that maximizing stroke volume (or increasing it until a plateau is reached) by volume loading during <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">high-risk surgery</span> may improve post-operative outcome.

In the 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 group the mean decrease in the Partial Mayo UC Score was \u22120.5 \u00b1 1.5 (p = 0.38) compared to \u22121.3 \u00b1 2.9 (p = 0.19) in the 4,000 IU vitamin D3 group but this was not statistically significant. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">CRP levels decreased after 90 days of daily vitamin D3 in both the 2,000 IU group and 4,000 IU group by \u22123.0 \u00b1 9.4 (p = 0.4) and \u221210.8 \u00b1 35.0 (p = 0.36) respectively.</span>\n\nCONCLUSION.\nVitamin D3 at 4,000 IU/day is more effective than 2,000 IU/day in increasing vitamin D to sufficient levels in UC patients with hypovitaminosis D, however higher doses or treatment beyond ninety days may be required. Vitamin D3 may improve the quality of life in UC patients but clinically significant improvement is not yet established. The effect of vitamin D3 on UC disease activity is still unclear.

Patients were interviewed to assess nausea, vomiting, anti-emetic use, dizziness, sore throat, headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2, 24 and 48 hours post operatively. Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup.\n\nRESULTS.\nAt 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea (38.2 % vs 17.9%, P = 0.03) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively (1.49 \u00b1 0.3 vs 0.68 \u00b1 0.2, P = 0.028). The incidence of vomiting and anti-emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups.

The UBS group experienced hypercloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, worse acid\u2013base equilibrium and higher level of NGAL.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes, acid\u2013base equilibrium, kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti-inflammatory mechanisms triggering.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT01320891).</pre>", "score": 0.1935863196849823, "bin": "(0.15, 0.2]"}, {"doc_id": 2774638, "model_name": "gpt-4-0613-nli", "reference_id": "e919819fd66f3f836e96a093309f89ef", "prediction_id": "f87fca7f634cb2f46e8a32e207bfe9df", "reference_question": "What questionnaire was used for this study?\n", "reference_answer": "The 46-item calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) was used for this study.", "reference_highlighted": "<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Open Sans,Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;\">INTRODUCTION.\nBecause foods fortified with calcium are increasingly available, the calcium content of calcium-fortified foods may not be adequately captured in traditional assessments of dietary intake, such as dietary records analyzed with commercially available software.

On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0\u00b730, 95 % CI 0\u00b709, 1\u00b700, P= 0\u00b7049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH. Therefore, UK women of childbearing age need to improve their Se status.</pre>", "score": 0.22028592228889465, "bin": "(0.2, 0.25]"}, {"doc_id": 3570228, "model_name": "gpt-4-0613-nli", "reference_id": "abf1cbcb973135af23b1dd0162730cab", "prediction_id": "88d83414c887f4aac17ecd5949959c24", "reference_question": "What hormones related to stress were looked at during the study?", "reference_answer": "Norepinephrine (increases heart rate and blood pumping from the heart), epinephrine (helps you prepare for stressful or dangerous situations) and angiotensin II (increases blood pressure, tells the kidneys to retain sodium and water, and stimulates the release of more stress hormones) levels in plasma were measured during the study.

Levosimendan (10\u03bcgr/kg) started 4 h prior to operation and we stopped LS before the initiation of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">During the rewarming period, we started again levosimendan (10\u03bcgr/kg) in combination with SNP (0.1-0.2 \u03bcgr/kg/min).</span> If mean blood pressure decreased by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values, for corrected of mean arterial pressure, the volume loading was performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate. Hemodynamic variables, inotrophyc requirement, and laboratory values were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nFive patients died (7.14%) post-surgery (one from SG and 4 from PG) due to low cardiac out-put syndrome (LOS). At the postoperative period, cardiac output and stroke volume index was higher in SG (mean\u00b1sd;29.1\u00b16.3 vs. 18.4\u00b14.9 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122 (P\u227a0.0001)). Stroke volume index (SVI) decreased from 29\u00b110mL/m2 preoperatively to 22\u00b114mL/m2 in the early postoperative period in group 1. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.002). Cardiac index was higher in SG (320.7\u00b137.5 vs. 283.0\u00b183.9 mL/min\u22121/m\u22122 (P=0.009)). The postoperative inotrophyc requirement was less in SG (5.6\u00b12.7 vs. 10.4\u00b12.0 mg/kg, P\u227a 0.008), and postoperative cardiac enzyme levels were less in SG (P\u227a 0.01). Ten patients (28.5%) in SG and 21 patients (60%) in PG required inotrophyc support (P\u227a0.001). We used IABP in eight patients (22.8%) in SG and 17 patients (48.5%) in CG (P=0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis study showed that LS and SNP combination impressive increase in left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions including LVEF. The use of this combination achieved more less inotrophics and IABP requirement.

In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels</span>.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, EE housing was able to restore the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mTBI.</pre>", "score": 0.303335040807724, "bin": "(0.3, 0.35]"}, {"doc_id": 4937273, "model_name": "mistral-7b-instruct-one-shot", "reference_id": "c21834cd33e9fc03204b6a526a8b33b6", "prediction_id": "bc9d25d6a98ecb7794bcaa45948280d7", "reference_question": "What conclusion was drawn about the cholesterol-lowering drugs, besides the reduction in cholesterol?", "reference_answer": "The researchers concluded that the cholesterol-lowering drugs seemed to increase levels of PCSK9, which then increased the binding of the drug alirocumab.", "reference_highlighted": "<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Open Sans,Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;\">BACKGROUND.\nAlirocumab undergoes target\u2010mediated clearance via binding of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (\u22120.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (\u22120.20 to 0.63) \u03bcmol \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 in the HP and NP group.

Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients.\n\nRESULTS.\nThirty-six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 month, mostly because of subjective intolerance. Eighty-three events (TAM 39, follow-up 44) occurred: locoregional relapse in 10/8, distant metastases in 14/16, metachronous breast cancer in 4/10, other tumours in 11/10 patients. Less ER-positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than in follow-up patients (1 vs 10, p = 0.005). Event-free survival was similar in both groups of patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThis 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous ER-positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients.

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52\u201385 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine).</span> In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale\u2013Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI \u22656) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus \u22123 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (\u22123.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdd-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity.

The recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and width of the keratinized tissue (KT) were measured at baseline, at three and six month intervals.\n\nRESULTS.\nForty-six Miller's class I and II gingival recessions were treated. In the CAF + Type I collagen membrane (NEOMEM)-treated (Group B) sites the baseline gingival recession was 2.34 \u00b1 0.48 mm, while in the CAFtreated (Group A) sites it was 2.52 \u00b1 0.84 mm.

The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain.</span> This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 \u00b1 2, 50 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.\n\nRESULTS.\nBIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.</pre>", "score": 0.6291689872741699, "bin": "(0.6, 0.65]"}, {"doc_id": 3232074, "model_name": "gpt-4-0613-nli", "reference_id": "a50ff0d2a69dbcf80b8e677ce85d01dd", "prediction_id": "2e471064320131b1ded7c8d3b630237e", "reference_question": "What kind of tests were used to assess patients in this study?", "reference_answer": "Participants were assessed with laboratory tests, the United Kingdom screening test (a five question test to assess diabetic foot ulcers), the Michigan neuropathy screening score (a 15-item questionnaire filled out by the patient and an examination of the lower half of the body to assess diabetic foot ulcers), and the Michigan diabetic neuropathy score (which includes an exam of the nervous system and a test for how fast signals travel through the nervous system).

Maternal age, education and social class were positively associated with Se status. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">After adjustment, whole-blood Se concentration was higher in women consuming Brazil nuts (P= 0\u00b7040) and in those consuming more than two seafood portions per week (P= 0\u00b7054).</span> A stepwise logistic regression model revealed that among the Se-related risk factors, only toenail Se (OR 0\u00b738, 95 % CI 0\u00b717, 0\u00b787, P= 0\u00b7021) significantly affected the OR for PE/PIH. On excluding non-compliers with Se treatment, Se supplementation also significantly reduced the OR for PE/PIH (OR 0\u00b730, 95 % CI 0\u00b709, 1\u00b700, P= 0\u00b7049). In conclusion, UK women have low Se status that increases their risk of developing PE/PIH.

This suggests that nanoparticles in the respiratory tract induce systemic inflammation.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDutch Trial Register no. 2976. 11 July 2011. http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2976\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12890-017-0463-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</pre>", "score": 0.7441329956054688, "bin": "(0.7, 0.75]"}, {"doc_id": 5019463, "model_name": "gpt-4-0613-nli", "reference_id": "854289e08b5bbfd7f48507d94afff233", "prediction_id": "d38bbcb55255d19d5640bf71d5fbb372", "reference_question": "Which group received which level of appointment schedule support?", "reference_answer": "One group got their check-ups in their community with a patient navigator (Group 1), the next group got check-ups in an office with a navigator (Group 2), and the final group got office check-ups but without a navigator (Group 3).", "reference_highlighted": "<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Open Sans,Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;\">PURPOSE.\nPatients with glaucoma who do not keep their follow-up eye care appointments are at risk for developing more severe ocular disease.

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P \u227a .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P \u227a .001).

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P \u227a .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P \u227a .001). <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P \u227a .001) compared with the CFFFQ.</span> Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P \u227a .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P \u227a .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P \u227a .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P \u227a .001).

However, the PCF28 corrected for re-infection was lower, though not significantly, in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or the AS+CD groups (AS+AQ 18.3%; AL 24.2%; AS+CD 20.8%, p = 0.4) The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nAS+AQ is an appropriate first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Ghana and possibly in the neighbouring countries in West Africa. The effectiveness of AL in routine programme conditions needs to be studied further in West Africa.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00119145</pre>", "score": 0.8290771245956421, "bin": "(0.8, 0.85]"}, {"doc_id": 4599047, "model_name": "gpt-4-0613-one-shot", "reference_id": "7162cb4d5b6f53cbc048db9f3611f1b3", "prediction_id": "830a81fa5a82a71dfc67da6692eaf3cb", "reference_question": "What conditions did the patients included in the study have?", "reference_answer": "The patients included in the study were experiencing moderate lower back spinal degeneration in the L1 to L5 area of the back, including suffering from symptoms of intermittent neurogenic claudication (associated with spinal stenosis, which means the spinal canal begins to narrow in the lower part of the back).", "reference_highlighted": "<pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 12px; font-family: Roboto,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,Open Sans,Helvetica Neue,sans-serif;\">PURPOSE.\nThis report provides the 3-year clinical outcomes from the randomized, controlled US Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption trial of the Superion\u00ae for the treatment of moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe Superion\u00ae was evaluated in the treatment of subjects aged 45 years or older <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">suffering from symptoms of intermittent neurogenic claudication, secondary to a confirmed diagnosis of moderate degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis at one or two contiguous levels from L1 to L5.</span> Patients were treated between June 2008 and December 2011 at 31 investigational sites.

Properly designed controlled trials are necessary to assess the effectiveness of these practices. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early phase trial. Fifty patients seen at a fibromyalgia outpatient treatment program were randomly assigned to a daily soy or placebo (casein) shake. Outcome measures were scores of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. Analysis was with standard statistics based on the null hypothesis, and separation test for early phase CAM comparative trials. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">Use of standard statistics with intent-to-treat analysis showed that total FIQ scores decreased by 14% in the soy group (P = .02) and by 18% in the placebo group (P \u227a .001).</span> The difference in change in scores between the groups was not significant (P = .16).

We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of \u03b2 activity at the corresponding electrode. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: #ff725c;\">Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0\u00b10.1 volts.</span> Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.\n\nRESULTS.\nUPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation.

Taking into account the total number of patients recruited annually, treatment of patients on clinical trial protocols was associated with considerable cost savings across both the non-commercial and commercial portfolio.</pre>", "score": 0.9555395841598511, "bin": "(0.95, 1.0]"}, {"doc_id": 5125190, "model_name": "gpt-4-0613-one-shot", "reference_id": "200151efbb07acefb3ebd2f5a352a2d4", "prediction_id": "6f1e6073d04e45ce120c7d948236b5ec", "reference_question": "How was the pain evaluated?", "reference_answer": "Pain was evaluated verbally by patients on a four-point scale.

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P \u227a .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P \u227a .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P \u227a .001) compared with the CFFFQ.
