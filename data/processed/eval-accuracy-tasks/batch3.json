Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg, every 4\u20138 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1\u20132 weeks.\n\nPATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.\nPatients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, \u2265 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nNinety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77\u00b77%). Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae than with lanreotide microparticles (3\u00b78 (0\u00b75) vs 4\u00b73 (0\u00b75) ng/ml; P < 0\u00b7001). GH levels < 2\u00b75 ng/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH < 2\u00b75 ng/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and treatment was well accepted.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4\u20138 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7\u201314 days.", "target": "GOAL AND PLAN\nThe goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.\nWe asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogel\u00ae every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nNinety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the Autogel\u00ae than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the Autogel\u00ae and patients were happy with the treatment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks works just as well and is as well tolerated as using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every one to two weeks in treating acromegaly.", "question": "How many shots of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae were given to the participants?", "answer": "The participants received 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg."}, "predictions": [{"model_version": "info_loss_model", "score": 1, "result": [{"id": "0", "from_name": "source_label", "to_name": "source", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 582, "end": 655, "score": 1, "text": "Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg were administered.", "labels": ["omission"]}}]}]}, {"data": {"doc_id": 1868720, "edit_id": "e90a96e72bf1ceeebacec33792bf97f5", "source": "BACKGROUND.\nIt is unclear if objective selection of employees, for an intervention to prevent sickness absence, is more effective than subjective 'personal enlistment'.

The primary objective of our study was to design and test a calcium-focused food frequency questionnaire (CFFFQ) including foods naturally rich in calcium and calcium-fortified foods. Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P < .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg/d vs 800 [433] mg/d, P < .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes. For calcium classified by food groups, there was moderate correlation for dairy (r = 0.56, P < .001) and fruits (r = 0.43, P < .001). The CFFFQ overestimated mean total calcium compared with the 24-hour recall by 221 mg/d (P < .001), including within racial groups (195 mg/d for black women, P = .04, and 229 mg/d for white women, P < .001). Dairy was the primary calcium source for both groups (55% of intake for black women and 57% of intake for white women).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CFFFQ can be used to identify postmenopausal women with inadequate calcium intakes (<800 mg/d) and to identify key sources of dietary calcium. Older black women consume less daily calcium than do older white women.", "target": "INTRODUCTION:\nMore and more foods are being boosted with extra calcium. Because of this, it might be hard for traditional methods that measure how much calcium a person gets from their food to accurately work out how much they're really getting, especially if these methods are using off-the-shelf software. We wanted to create and test a special questionnaire that focused on calcium intake, which would also take into account foods naturally full of calcium and those that have extra calcium added to them. We also wanted to take a closer look at where black and white women going through menopause, in particular, get their calcium from and whether or not they're getting enough.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with a mixed group of 185 black and white women going through menopause, whose ages averaged around 70 years. They were asked to recall everything they've eaten in the last 24 hours and then answer our 46-item special calcium questionnaire. \n\nRESULTS:\nWe found that the daily calcium intake measured by our questionnaire strongly matched with the 24-hour food recall. Interestingly, our questionnaire showed a higher total daily calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall. As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall underestimated the amount of calcium intake compared to our questionnaire. Our results also showed that dairy was the main source of calcium for both black and white women. Though our questionnaire estimated a higher amount of calcium intake compared to the 24-hour recall, it was more accurate in identifying low calcium intakes.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur special questionnaire can be used to find out if women going through menopause are not getting enough calcium in their diet (less than 800 milligrams per day). Additionally, it can shed light on the main sources of dietary calcium.

We wanted to see if people with depression could use this technique to increase their brain's response to positive personal memories, and if this could affect their symptoms.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with people who have depression but are not taking medication. We divided these individuals into two groups: one was shown rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala and the other from a different brain area (as a comparison).

Subjects were presented working memory n-back task while the reaction time and accuracy were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nA repeated measures, mixed design ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the type of stimulation (sham vs. active) in anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC [F(1,55)= 5.29, P=0.019], but not the inverse polarity worsened accuracy in the 2-back working memory task. There were also no statistically significant changes in speed of working memory [F(1,55)= 0.458,P=0.502] related to type or order of stimulation.\n\nDISCUSSION.\nThe results would imply to a polarity dependence of bilateral tDCS of working memory. Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair working memory, while the reverser stimulation had no effect.

One area of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC), is particularly important for working memory.

We split them into two groups and used tDCS to stimulate different sides of their DLPFC. All participants were given tasks to test their working memory while we measured their speed and accuracy.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur analysis indicated that the type of stimulation mattered. When we stimulated the left side of the DLPFC and reduced activity on the right side, it clearly messed with participants' memory accuracy. However, doing the opposite didn't have any noticeable effect. No changes in speed were seen either way.\n\nDISCUSSION.\nOur results suggest that how we use tDCS on working memory matters, and that stimulating the left side of the DLPFC while reducing activity on the right could disrupt memory.

SI joint fusion can relieve pain and improve quality of life in patients who have failed nonoperative care. To date, no study has concurrently compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for chronic SI joint dysfunction.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of 148 subjects with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruptions who were assigned to either minimally invasive SI joint fusion with triangular titanium implants (N=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SI joint pain scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment commencement. Six-month success rates, defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a 20-mm improvement in SI joint pain in the absence of severe device-related or neurologic SI joint-related adverse events or surgical revision, were compared using Bayesian methods.\n\nRESULTS.\nSubjects (mean age 51, 70% women) were highly debilitated at baseline (mean SI joint VAS pain score 82, mean ODI score 62). Six-month follow-up was obtained in 97.3%.

Sometimes, this pain can be treated by using surgery to fuse or join together parts of this joint. However, we don't have any studies yet that have compared how patients do with this surgery versus without it.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe set up a study with 148 patients who had problems with their sacroiliac joint. We randomly picked some to get a special kind of low-impact surgery (102 people), while others (46 people) were treated without surgery. We measured how much pain and disability our patients were feeling when the study started. Then, we checked on them 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to see if there was an improvement. \n\nRESULTS.\nOur patients, most of whom were women and averaged 51 years of age, were having a lot of trouble with pain and disability at the start of the study.

A recent acute trial of unilateral aDBS showed that aDBS can lead to substantial improvements in contralateral hemibody Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and may be superior to conventional continuous DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). We test whether potential benefits are retained with bilateral aDBS and in the face of concurrent medication.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe applied bilateral aDBS in 4 patients with PD undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus. aDBS was delivered bilaterally with independent triggering of stimulation according to the amplitude of \u03b2 activity at the corresponding electrode. Mean stimulation voltage was 3.0\u00b10.1 volts. Motor assessments consisted of double-blinded video-taped motor UPDRS scores that included both limb and axial features.\n\nRESULTS.\nUPDRS scores were 43% (p=0.04; Cohen's d=1.62) better with aDBS than without stimulation. Motor improvement with aDBS occurred despite an average time on stimulation (ToS) of only 45%.

Linear regression revealed that the cognitive subtests of the WCJ-III test significantly predicted performance across dependent variable measures.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nListening effort is significantly affected by task complexity, regardless of age. Performance on the WCJ-III test may predict listening effort in adults and may assist speech-language pathologist (SLPs) to understand challenges faced by participants when subjected to noise.", "target": "PURPOSE.\nThis study aims to establish if a test we often use to assess thinking skills can also help us understand how hard adults of different ages find it to listen and do something else at the same time.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe had two groups of volunteers. The first group, made up of 14 people mostly women (11 out of 14), were aged between 41 and 61 years. The second group had 15 people, only nine women, aged between 63 and 81. We asked these people to do a few tests from the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III. This is an assessment tool we typically use to evaluate how the brain processes information. Then our volunteers had to do two tasks at the same time. These tasks were a bit different for each round, but the idea was always the same: listen to something while also watching something.\n\nRESULTS.\nLooking at the results, it became clear that the difficulty of the task influences how well people did in terms of hearing accurately, seeing accurately, and how quickly they processed information. Additionally, the certain thinking-related subtests from the taken test could potentially help predict how well people performed in complex tests.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIt turns out that the more difficult the task, the harder it can be for anyone, regardless of their age, to listen and do another task at the same time. Also, the better someone does on the specific Woodcock\u2013Johnson III test, the easier they might find doing two things at once. This information may help speech-language experts understand the problems individuals might run into when there's background noise.", "question": "How was the relationship between task complexity and performance measures determined?", "answer": "A repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to determine the relationship between task complexity and performance measures."}, "predictions": [{"model_version": "info_loss_model", "score": 1, "result": [{"id": "0", "from_name": "source_label", "to_name": "source", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 986, "end": 1165, "score": 1, "text": "A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that task complexity significantly affected the performance measures of auditory accuracy, visual accuracy, and processing speed.", "labels": ["concept"]}}, {"id": "1", "from_name": "target_label", "to_name": "target", "type": "labels", "value": {"start": 805, "end": 1002, "score": 1, "text": "Looking at the results, it became clear that the difficulty of the task influences how well people did in terms of hearing accurately, seeing accurately, and how quickly they processed information.", "labels": ["concept"]}}]}]}, {"data": {"doc_id": 5861369, "edit_id": "89a12110d163c168e09a3e1742f6863e", "source": "BACKGROUND/AIMS.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance, adrenal hyperactivity and decreased mental health.
