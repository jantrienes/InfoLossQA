[{"id": 5448649, "source": "Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed. In the current study, we conducted an open\u2010label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen\u2010specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients. Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25). A maximum of four HLA\u2010matched peptides were selected based on the pre\u2010existing peptide\u2010specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration. T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm. The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression\u2010free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm. The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL\u20106 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen\u2010specific T cell responses. These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL\u20106\u2010mediated immune suppression. Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.", "target": "Biliary tract cancer (aBTC), a type of liver cancer, has a very poor survival rate. To help improve this, we're researching new treatments, one of which includes therapies that strengthen the body's immune system. \n\nIn a recent study, we tested a treatment using low-dose cyclophosphamide (CPA), a type of drug often used in chemotherapy, combined with a personalised peptide vaccination (PPV). The PPV is tailored specifically to each patient's immune response. To test this combined treatment, we gave it to 24 patients and compared them to a group of 25 patients who received only the PPV. \n\nResults showed that those who received the combination of CPA and PPV had a stronger immune response and displayed slower cancer progression, living longer than those who received only PPV. We noticed that the combo treatment worked better because it prevented the release of IL-6 protein, a substance which can suppress the immune system. \n\nIn conclusion, the addition of low-dose CPA to PPV shows promise as a potential treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer patients. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}]
