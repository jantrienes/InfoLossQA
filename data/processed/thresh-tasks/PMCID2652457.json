[{"id": 2652457, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nPromoting awareness of autism in populations who work with children may result in an earlier diagnosis of the condition. In this study, a computer assisted learning (CAL) package, containing educationally appropriate knowledge about autism was developed; and the effectiveness of this CAL package was evaluated.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe CAL package was developed using computer software, \"Xerte\" and \"Flash Macromedia\". The effectiveness of the CAL package was evaluated in 32 childcare students in the UK, who were randomised to watch the CAL package or to read the information leaflet containing the same information (n = 16 in each group). Retention performance, level of enjoyment, and level of confidence to identify a child with autism, after the interventions, were evaluated. The data obtained from two studied groups was analysed using unpaired Student's t-test, 95% confidence interval, and effect size.\n\nRESULTS.\nStudents who watched the CAL package had superior retention performance percentage scores (p = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.83\u201312.19, effect size = 0.8) and level of enjoyment (p = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.03\u20132.75, effect size = 0.7) compared with students who read the information leaflet. However, there was no significant difference in level of confidence to identify a child with autism (p = 0.39, 95% CI = -1.80\u20130.72, effect size = -0.3).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe CAL package developed was an effective method of educating people who work with children about autism.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study was performed to show the importance of increasing autism awareness among those who work with children, as it could lead to an earlier diagnosis. For this, the researchers developed a computer program which teaches properly about autism and then checked how well it did the job.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe computer program, a learning tool, was created using two types of computer software. To test its effectiveness, they gave it to 32 childcare students in the UK. Half of these students got to learn with this computer program, while the other half read a leaflet containing the same information. To see how well they learned, the researchers checked how much they remembered, how much they enjoyed the process, and how confident they felt in recognizing a child with autism. Then, they used statistical methods to analyze the data from both groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nStudents who used the computer program remembered more information and enjoyed learning more as compared to students who read the leaflet. However, both groups had the same level of confidence in recognizing a child with autism.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFrom this study, the researchers concluded that the computer program they developed was a useful tool in teaching people who work with children about autism."}]
