Given this, it's important to explore ways of boosting their spiritual wellness. In this study, we examined the effects of religious programs based on Islam on improving spiritual health among elderly people with high blood pressure attending health clinics in Isfahan in 2014.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe carried out our experiment by selecting 52 older people with high blood pressure and splitting them randomly into two groups. One group attended an Islamic-based religious program for eight sessions in two health centers in Isfahan. A questionnaire designed to measure spiritual wellbeing was completed by both groups during three stages; before the program (pre-test), at the end of the program (post-test), and a month after the program (follow-up). We used statistical tests to analyze the data we collected.\n\nRESULTS.\nBefore the religious program, there was no significant difference between the spiritual wellbeing scores of the two groups. However, after the program and a month later, the group that attended the program had significantly higher spiritual wellbeing scores than the group that did not attend the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur findings suggest that an Islamic-based religious program can enhance the spiritual wellbeing of elderly people with high blood pressure. Therefore, health professionals like nurses can use such programs to improve their patients' spiritual health."}]
