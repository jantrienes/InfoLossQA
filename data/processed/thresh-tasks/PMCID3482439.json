[{"id": 3482439, "source": "This study is a randomized prospective study comparing two fracture fixation implants, the extramedullary sliding hip screw (SHS) and the dual lag screw cephalomedullary nail, in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures in the elderly. One hundred and sixty-five patients with low-energy intertrochanteric fractures, classified as AO/OTA 31A, were prospectively included during a 2-year period (2005\u20132006). Patients were randomized into two groups: group A included 79 hip fractures managed with sliding hip screws and group B included 86 fractures treated with cephalomedullary nails. Delay to surgery, duration of surgery, time of fluoroscopy, total hospital stay, implant-related complications, transfusion requirements, re-operation details, functional recovery, and mortality were recorded. The mean follow-up was 36 months (24\u201356 months). The mean surgical time was statistically significantly shorter and fluoroscopy time longer for the group B. No intraoperative femoral shaft fractures occurred. There was no statistically significant difference in the functional recovery score, reoperation, and mortality rates between the 2 groups. A new type of complication, the so-called Z-effect phenomenon, was noticed in the cephalomedullary nail group. There are no statistically significant differences between the two techniques in terms of type and rate of complications, functional outcome, reoperation and mortality rates when comparing the SHS and the cephalomedullary nail for low-energy AO/OTA 31A intertrochanteric fractures. Our data do not support recommendations for the use of one implant over the other.", "target": "This study compares two types of implants used to fix broken hips in older people. The research looked at 165 patients who had a specific type of hip fracture, over a two-year period. They were divided into two groups: group A had one type of implant (the sliding hip screw) and group B had a different type (cephalomedullary nails). We compared a number of factors including time until and duration of surgery, how long they stayed in the hospital, any complications related to the implants, whether they needed a blood transfusion, if the surgery had to be repeated, how well they recovered, and if they died during the time of the study. \n\nThe main findings were that surgery was faster but required more x-ray imaging for group B. There were no broken thigh bones during surgery. Both groups had similar scores for recovery, repeat surgery, and death rates. However, we noticed a new complication in the group treated with cephalomedullary nails, named as the Z-effect. \n\nAfter comparing these two types of implants, we didn't see any significant differences between the SHS and the cephalomedullary nail for this specific kind of hip fracture, including outcomes, complications, and death rates. Therefore, we can't recommend one implant over the other based on our study."}]
