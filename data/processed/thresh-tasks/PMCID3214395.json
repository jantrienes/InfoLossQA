[{"id": 3214395, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nInduction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (BIS) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting BIS monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target BIS (60 \u00b1 2, 50 \u00b1 2 and 40 \u00b1 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and BIS were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.\n\nRESULTS.\nBIS could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThese results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different BIS values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of BIS is required.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nGetting the right level of anesthesia for a surgery is very important. For children, the most common method is to have them breathe in the anesthetic. A tube may need to be put down the throat once the child is deeply asleep. It can be hard to tell exactly how deep the sleep is. One way to measure this is using something called a Bispectral index (BIS). In this study, we wanted to see how well the BIS can tell us when a child is asleep enough for the tube to be safely put in.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a test with ninety children who were aged 1 to 6 years and were about to have surgery. We started to monitor their BIS and separated them randomly into three groups. The anesthesia was started by gradually increasing the amount of anesthetic in a mix of oxygen and nitrous oxide. We kept increasing until the BIS reached certain target levels. After the tube was put in, we noted how long the process took, whether there were any complications like trouble breathing, if the child moved, and how long they stayed asleep. \n\nRESULTS.\nThe BIS didn't help us to know the best level of anesthesia for putting the tube in. There was no difference in how long it took, whether there were any problems, or how long the children stayed asleep between the three groups. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results showed that there wasn't a significant difference in problems related to putting in the tube at different BIS levels. To make sure the level of anesthesia is deep enough, we might need to aim for lower BIS values.\n"}]
