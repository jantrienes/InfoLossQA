[{"id": 5506592, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nDengue is a serious public health issue that affects households in endemic areas in terms of health and also economically, imposing costs for prevention and treatment of cases. The Camino Verde cluster-randomised controlled trial in Mexico and Nicaragua assessed the impact of evidence-based community engagement in dengue prevention. The Mexican arm of the trial was conducted in 90 randomly selected communities in three coastal regions of Guerrero State. This study reports an analysis of a secondary outcome of the trial: household use of and expenditure on anti-mosquito products. We examined whether the education and mobilisation activities of the trial motivated people to spend less on anti-mosquito products.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe carried out a household questionnaire survey in the trial communities in 2010 (12,312 households) and 2012 (5349 households in intervention clusters, 5142 households in control clusters), including questions about socio-economic status, self-reported dengue illness, and purchase of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products in the previous month. We examined expenditures on anti-mosquito products at baseline in relation to social vulnerability and we compared use of and expenditures on these products between intervention and control clusters in 2012.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn 2010, 44.2% of 12,312 households reported using anti-mosquito products, with a mean expenditure of USD4.61 per month among those who used them. Socially vulnerable households spent less on the products. In 2012, after the intervention, the proportion of households who purchased anti-mosquito products in the last month was significantly lower in intervention clusters (47.8%; 2503/5293) than in control clusters (53.3%; 2707/5079) (difference \u2212 0.05, 95% CIca \u22120.100 to \u22120.010). The mean expenditure on the products, among those households who bought them, was USD6.43; 30.4% in the intervention clusters and 36.7% in the control clusters spent more than this (difference \u2212 0.06, 95% CIca \u22120.12 to \u22120.01). These expenditures on anti-mosquito products represent 3.3% and 3.8% respectively of monthly household income for the poorest 10% of the population in 2012.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe Camino Verde community mobilisation intervention, as well as being effective in reducing dengue infections, was effective in reducing household use of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\n(ISRCTN27581154).", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nDengue is a major health problem that affects people's health and finances in areas where it's common, due to costs associated with prevention and treatment. A project called the Camino Verde trial in Mexico and Nicaragua looked at how educating communities about dengue prevention could help. One part of this project in Mexico involved 90 different communities across three coastal regions. This study focuses on whether the trial led households to spend less money on products to ward off mosquitoes.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted surveys in 2010 (12,312 households) and 2012 (approximately 10,500 households) asking about things like income, whether anyone had had dengue, and spending on mosquito-prevention products in the previous month. We compared spending on these products to social vulnerability and also looked at the difference in product use and spending between the households that received the intervention and those that did not in 2012. \n\nRESULTS.\nIn 2010, nearly half of the households used anti-mosquito products, spending on average $4.61 per month. Households that were more vulnerable socially spent less. In 2012, after the intervention, fewer households in the intervention group (47.8%) bought anti-mosquito products as compared to the control group (53.3%). Those who did buy them spent on average $6.43; more households in the control group spent above this amount as compared to the intervention group. These costs represented about 3.3% and 3.8% of the monthly income for the poorest 10% of the population in 2012.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe Camino Verde project, which aimed to educate communities about dengue prevention, not only helped reduce dengue infections but also decreased the money households spent on anti-mosquito products.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered with the identifier ISRCTN27581154."}]
