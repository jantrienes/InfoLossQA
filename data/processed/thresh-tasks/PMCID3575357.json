[{"id": 3575357, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nThe purpose is to assess cardiopulmonary function outcomes and quality of life values in inactive people that participated in the Physical Activity Promotion Programme (PAPP) against the control group that did not perform this program.\n\nMETHOD.\nA total of 100 subjects of both genders participated in the randomized controlled trial with systematic random sampling; all were aged 55 and older, from Torremolinos, Spain. Participants either received (n = 50) the PAPP for 60 minutes, twice a week during three months or (n = 50) they received health education. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured by general state of health the Short Form 12 health survey questionnaire, and the quality of life was determined with the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire. Cardiopulmonary function was measured with a spirometry and a walking test according to the Bruce protocol.\n\nRESULTS.\nThis pilot study had a significant impact on the quality of life (p = 0.05) in men, which increased. However, the quality of life in women did not improve. The average changes in the lung and cardiovascular function was not significant between groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nChanges in the quality of life measured with EQ-5D in the group of men who carried out the PAPP were statistically significant when comparing between groups. However changes in cardiopulmonary function were not as relevant when comparing between groups. There was a significant effect within each group in the pulmonary outcomes of values in men, within the experimental group.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nDeveloped by the University of M\u00e1laga.

We're comparing the results to a group of people who did not do the program.\n\nMETHOD.\nWe studied 100 people, men and women, from Torremolinos, Spain. Half of them did the PAPP for an hour twice a week for three months, the rest were given health education. We used questionnaires and health tests to measure how well their hearts and lungs were working, and how much their quality of life improved.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall, the program improved the quality of life in men, but not women. There wasn't a notable change in the heart and lung function for either group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe PAPP program was found to help improve quality of life for men but didn't show significant improvements in heart and lung function for anyone. Interestingly, men in the exercise group did see some improvements in lung outcomes.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study was conducted by the University of M\u00e1laga and you can find more details about it under the ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01172483."}]
