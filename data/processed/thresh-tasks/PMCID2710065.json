[{"id": 2710065, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nThe aim of this study was to prospectively compare single-dose intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis vs. no prophylaxis before minor cystoscopic procedures, including punch biopsy and transurethral resection (TUR) of small bladder tumors.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nA total of 200 patients with a mean age of 47.3 years old (range: 19\u201384 years old) with initial negative urine cultures were recruited. All patients underwent a diagnostic cystoscopy. Patients were then randomized into 2 groups: One group that did not receive antibiotics (100 patients) and the other group that received antibiotic treatment (100 patients with a single intravenous dose of cefoperazone). All patients had urine analysis and urine cultures on the second day after the operation. Additionally, clinical parameters including fever and dysuria were recorded. In 15% of the patients, incidental additional interventions such as punch biopsy or TUR of a small bladder tumor that were similarly distributed in both groups were performed.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn 1 patient from the antibiotic group and 2 patients from the no prophylaxis group, the urine cultures after cystoscopy were positive. No statistically significant difference was observed between these groups based on the microbiological and clinical parameters.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThe current study provides evidence that no antibiotic prophylaxis is required before diagnostic cystoscopy in patients without bacteriuria. But, the absolute risk of infection was small, suggesting that a much larger study is required.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study aimed to compare giving a single dose of antibiotics through an IV versus not giving any antibiotics before minor bladder procedures, such as a biopsy or small tumor removal.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe involved 200 patients who all had a bladder check-up procedure. The patients, who ranged in age from 19 to 84 years, were then split into two groups. One group didn't get any antibiotics and the other got a single dose of an antibiotic via an IV. All of them had their urine tested the day after the procedure. We also checked if they had any fever or painful urination. In 15% of the patients, other procedures like a biopsy or small tumor removal were also conducted.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found bacteria in the urine of 1 patient who got antibiotics and 2 who didn't. But this difference was too small to conclude anything significant. \n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings suggest that antibiotics might not be necessary before a bladder check-up in patients who don't have bacteria in urine. However, the risk of infection was very low to begin with, so we need a larger study to be sure."}]
