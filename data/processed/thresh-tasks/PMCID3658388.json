[{"id": 3658388, "source": "One purported use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is to promote healing in damaged cells. The effects of LLLT on hearing loss and tinnitus have received some study, but results have been equivocal. The purpose of this study was to determine if LLLT improved hearing, speech understanding, and/or cochlear function in adults with hearing loss. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects were assigned to a treatment, placebo, or control group. The treatment group was given LLLT, which consisted of shining low-level lasers onto the outer ear, head, and neck. Each laser treatment lasted approximately five minutes. Three treatments were applied within the course of one week. A battery of auditory tests was administered immediately before the first treatment and immediately after the third treatment. The battery consisted of pure-tone audiometry, the Connected Speech Test, and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions. Data were analyzed by comparing pre- and posttest results. No statistically significant differences were found between groups for any of the auditory tests. Additionally, no clinically significant differences were found in any individual subjects. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01820416).", "target": "Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been suggested as a method to promote healing in damaged cells. This includes the potential to help with hearing loss and tinnitus (a ringing or noise in the ears), although research so far has shown mixed results. Our study aimed to check if this treatment could improve hearing, understanding of speech, and general ear function in adults suffering from hearing loss.\n\nTo do this, we set up a study where subjects were sorted into three groups randomly. One group received the laser treatment, which involved shining low-level lasers onto their outer ear, head, and neck. Each laser treatment lasted about five minutes and was given three times in a week. Another group was given a placebo treatment, and the third group was not treated.\n\nWe ran a series of hearing tests on each participant right before the first treatment and right after the last one. Our tests checked how well they could hear, understand speech, and how well their ear was working overall (using what's called pure-tone audiometry, the Connected Speech Test, and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions). \n\nAfter comparing the before and after results of all the tests, we found that there were no significant differences in the hearing abilities among the three groups. Meaning, the laser treatment did not bring about any noticeable improvement. Similarly, no significant changes were noticed in the hearing abilities of any individual participant either.\n\nThis experiment has been officially registered with a database called ClinicalTrials.gov under the ID: NCT01820416."}]
