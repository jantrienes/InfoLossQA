[{"id": 5019971, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nThe increased risk of abacavir in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in HIV-infected patients is still being debated. Maraviroc, a CCR5 blocker, has been shown to decrease immune activation and monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques in murine experiments. Therefore, we examined the effect of maraviroc intensification on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in abacavir-treated HIV-infected patients and its effect on immunological and inflammatory parameters.\n\nMETHODS.\nA open-label prospective crossover study with a duration of 16 weeks: 8 weeks of intervention (maraviroc intensification) and 8 weeks of control (unchanged cART regimen). FMD, HIV-specific variables, expression of HIV co-receptors, markers of inflammation and coagulation and cellular markers of immune activation were measured at weeks 0, 8 and 16. The changes (\u0394) in these variables were compared between intervention and control periods using non-parametric tests. To evaluate the relation with the change in FMD, linear regression modeling was used.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-one male patients with suppressed plasma HIV-RNA, on cART, had a known HIV infection for 9.2 years (IQR 6.9\u201313.5) with abacavir use for 6.5 years (2.8\u20139.3). A significantly increased FMD of 0.73% (IQR \u22120.25 to 1.70) was seen after maraviroc intensification compared to a decrease of \u22120.42% (IQR \u22121.89 to 0.25; p = 0.049) in the control period. There was a negative relation between \u0394FMD with \u0394D-dimer (\u03b2 \u221222.70, 95% CI \u221239.27; \u22126.13, p = 0.011) and \u0394CD95+ CD4+ T cells (\u03b2 \u22120.16, 95% CI \u22120.28; \u22120.04, p = 0.013), adjusted for age and duration of HIV.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nMaraviroc intensification modestly improves endothelial function in HIV-infected patients on an abacavir-containing regimen.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT01389063.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40121-016-0115-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nThis is a study on the drug Maraviroc and its effects on HIV patients who are also taking the drug Abacavir, which some believe may increase their risk of heart disease. Maraviroc is known to decrease immune activation and inflammation in mouse experiments, so we wanted to see if it has similar effects in HIV patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a study for 16 weeks, with half of that time the patients were given extra Maraviroc in addition to their regular HIV medication, and the other half they didn't change anything in their treatment. We tested a range of health markers at the start, halfway and end of the study. We then compared the results from when the patients were given extra Maraviroc and when they weren't.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe study was carried out in 21 male patients who had been living with HIV for an average of 9.2 years and were taking Abacavir for an average of 6.5 years. We found that Maraviroc improved blood flow which is beneficial for heart health. Also, there was a negative relationship between improvements in blood flow and inflammation, as well as immune activation, which suggests Maraviroc might be protecting against inflammation and immune activation.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdding Maraviroc modestly improves blood flow in HIV patients on Abacavir.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nNCT01389063.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nFor those with access, there's additional information available online related to this study."}]
