Seventy-five premolar teeth were randomly divided into a control group and 4 experimental groups in accordance with the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions in the test solutions. After specimen preparation of the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups, all the specimens were submerged in each test solution for 15 minutes three times a day during 7 days. Microhardness tests on the Unexposed and Etched enamel subgroups were performed with 10 specimens from each group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests on the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups were performed with 5 specimens from each group. Microhardness changes in different groups were statistically compared using paired t-tests, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe microhardness changes were significantly different between the groups (p = 0.000). The microhardness changes in all experimental groups except Group 3 (low-level carbonated water with calcium ions) were significantly greater than those in the Control group. SEM showed that etched areas of the specimen were affected by carbonated water and the magnitude of destruction varied between groups. Adhesive material was partially removed in groups exposed to carbonated water.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nCarbonated water has negative effects on etched or sealed enamel, resulting in decreased microhardness and removal of the adhesive material.", "target": "GOAL:\nWe wanted to see how fizzy water affects the hard outer layer of your teeth, which we call 'enamel'. We also wanted to figure out whether the effect changes based on how fizzy the water is and whether or not it contains calcium.\n\nWHAT WE DID:\nWe made fizzy water with different levels of carbonation. We then took 75 pre-molar teeth and split them into a control group and four test groups. The groups were divided based on the fizziness of the water and whether or not it contained calcium. The first group was not exposed to anything, the second had its enamel etched (like being scratched), and the third was sealed. This process took place over seven days, with each group submerged in the fizzy water for fifteen minutes, three times a day. After that, we tested the hardness of the enamel and looked at the enamel under a high-powered microscope, using a selection of teeth from each group.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nEnamel hardness changed significantly across the groups. In all test groups, the hardness of the enamel decreased more than in the control group, except in the group exposed to lightly fizzy water with calcium. We found that fizzy water destroyed the etched areas of the teeth and the extent of this destruction differed between groups. The fizzy water also partially removed a sticky material we applied to the teeth.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS:\nOur research shows that fizzy water can harm the tough enamel layer of your teeth, making it softer and removing applied adhesive. The harm varies depending on how fizzy the water is and whether it contains calcium."}]
