[{"id": 4171519, "source": "Fracture risk in type 2 diabetes is increased despite normal or high bone mineral density, implicating poor bone quality as a risk factor. Raloxifene improves bone material and mechanical properties independent of bone mineral density. This study aimed to determine if raloxifene prevents the negative effects of diabetes on skeletal fragility in diabetes-prone rats. Adult Zucker Diabetic Sprague-Dawley (ZDSD) female rats (20-week-old, n = 24) were fed a diabetogenic high-fat diet and were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of raloxifene or vehicle for 12 weeks. Blood glucose was measured weekly and glycated hemoglobin was measured at baseline and 12 weeks. At sacrifice, femora and lumbar vertebrae were harvested for imaging and mechanical testing. Raloxifene-treated rats had a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with vehicle-treated rats. In addition, raloxifene-treated rats had blood glucose levels significantly lower than both diabetic vehicle-treated rats as well as vehicle-treated rats that did not become diabetic. Femoral toughness was greater in raloxifene-treated rats compared with both diabetic and non-diabetic vehicle-treated ZDSD rats, due to greater energy absorption in the post-yield region of the stress-strain curve. Similar differences between groups were observed for the structural (extrinsic) mechanical properties of energy-to-failure, post-yield energy-to-failure, and post-yield displacement. These results show that raloxifene is beneficial in preventing the onset of diabetes and improving bone material properties in the diabetes-prone ZDSD rat. This presents unique therapeutic potential for raloxifene in preserving bone quality in diabetes as well as in diabetes prevention, if these results can be supported by future experimental and clinical studies.", "target": "People with type 2 diabetes tend to have higher chances of bone fractures even though their bone density is normal or even higher than average. This indicates that the quality of their bone might be the real issue. Raloxifene is a drug recognized for increasing bone quality regardless of bone density. This study was conducted to see whether Raloxifene can offset the negative impact of diabetes on bone strength in rats that are prone to diabetes.\n\n24 adult rats which were likely to develop diabetes were chosen for this experiment. They were all females and were 20 weeks old. They were fed a high-fat diet that could lead to diabetes and divided randomly into two groups. One group received daily injections of Raloxifene for 12 weeks and the other group got a placebo. \n\nDuring this period, their blood sugar levels were checked every week. Hemoglobin levels which can give us an idea about long-term blood glucose levels were checked at the start and end of the experiments. The bones in their legs and back were tested after the rats were killed.\n\nThe group of rats that received Raloxifene saw fewer cases of diabetes compared to the placebo group. Additionally, their blood sugar levels were significantly lower than the other group. Importantly, the leg bones of the Raloxifene group were stronger, meaning they didn\u2019t break easily because they could absorb more energy before yielding. It was observed that this picture is similar when looking at the structural features of the bone like energy required to cause a break, the amount of energy beyond which breakage occurs and the distance for which it can stretch beyond this point.\n\nThese results suggest Raloxifene could be beneficial in preventing the start of diabetes and improving bone health in those susceptible to diabetes. If future experiments and patient tests confirm these results, it could be a new way to manage the quality of bone in diabetes patients and simultaneously prevent the onset of diabetes."}]
