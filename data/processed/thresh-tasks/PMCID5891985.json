[{"id": 5891985, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nIt has been suggested that liraglutide could have an impact on glucose and lipid metabolism disorder and adhesion molecule activation, which may play important roles in the vascular damage of diabetes. In this study, we examined the effects of liraglutide versus metformin on non-esterified free fatty acids, beta-cell insulin secretion, and adhesion molecule levels in patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn this study, 60 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 33.97 \u00b1 5.67 years) were randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide or oral metformin. Before the study and after the 8-week treatment period, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Plasma glucose, lipids and lipoprotein, plasma insulin, glycaemic and insulin responses, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter 8 weeks, 120 min of NEFA (155 \u00b1 125 vs 99 \u00b1 73 \u03bcmol/L, P = 0.026) and the levels of sVCAM-1 (465 \u00b1 136 vs 382 \u00b1 131 ng/ml, P = 0.013) significantly decreased, while the early phase insulin secretion index (24.94 [7.78, 38.89] vs. 31.13 [17.67, 59.09], P = 0.031), fasting plasma insulin (104 [51, 123] vs 113 [54, 171] mIU/L, P = 0.015), 60 min plasma insulin (326 [165, 441] vs 471 [334, 717] mIU/L, P = 0.005), 120 min plasma insulin (401 [193, 560] vs 500 [367, 960] mIU/L, P = 0.047), and insulin area under the curve (AUCins) (648 [321, 742] vs 738 [451, 1118] mIU/L, P = 0.005) remarkably increased for patients in the liraglutide treatment group. The levels of sVCAM-1 dramatically decreased after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment (503 \u00b1 182 vs 382 \u00b1 131 ng/ml, P = 0.046) compared to that of the metformin treatment group. At the same time, the differences before and after liraglutide treatment in 120 min of NEFA (\u2212 32 [\u2212 96, \u2212 5] vs 5 [\u2212 35, 38] \u03bcmol/L, P = 0.033) and AUCins (738 [451, 1118] vs 594 [357, 1216] mIU/L, P = 0.014) were remarkably enhanced compared to that of the metformin therapy. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in fasting NEFA after liraglutide or metformin treatment. The reduction of 120 min NEFA (\u0394NEFA) was positively correlated with the decrease of sVCAM-1 (\u0394sVCAM-1) after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment (r = 0.523, P = 0.003).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results demonstrate that liraglutide administration is more effective than metformin in reducing 120 min NEFA and suppressing sVCAM-1 levels for recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. We suggest that this outcome may be because liraglutide is associated with potentiating insulin secretion capacity, inhibiting vascular inflammatory cytokines, and antagonizing atherosclerosis.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12933-018-0701-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at how a drug called liraglutide might help treat type 2 diabetes. We wanted to see if it could improve how the body uses sugar and fats. We also wanted to see if the drug could reduce damage to the blood vessels, which is a common complication of diabetes. We compared the effects of liraglutide to another popular diabetes medication, metformin.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested 60 people who had just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Half of them were given liraglutide and the other half were given metformin. We did a sugar tolerance test before the study and after 8 weeks of treatment. We also measured levels of different substances in their blood, such as glucose, fats, insulin, and a particular molecule associated with blood vessel damage.\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter 8 weeks, those given liraglutide showed a good improvement. Their blood showed less of the harmful fats and of the molecule linked to blood vessel damage, and more insulin (which helps regulate sugar in the body). This group also had a better response to the sugar tolerance test. The people who took metformin didn't seem to improve as much.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLiraglutide seems to be a better option than metformin for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. It appears to help the body better manage sugar and fats, and it may reduce blood vessel inflammation and the risk of hardening of the arteries."}]
