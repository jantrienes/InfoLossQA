[{"id": 4069047, "source": "PURPOSE.\nA link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently been suggested. Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nThe effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52\u201385 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale\u2013Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.\n\nRESULTS.\nPatients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (P=0.004) and MMSE (P=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI \u22656) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (P=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus \u22123 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (\u22123.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAdd-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.", "target": "PURPOSE:\nIt has been suggested that a lack of good quality sleep might be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Since levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps control sleep, are often low in people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, we wanted to know if adding melatonin to their medication would help. We also wondered if these effects were related to whether or not these patients also had sleep disorders.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nWe tested the effects of adding prolonged-release melatonin (a slow-release form of the hormone) in 80 patients, roughly half men and half women, with an average age of 75 years. These patients had been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's and were already receiving standard treatment. Some of these patients also had insomnia. For the first two weeks, we tested these patients with a placebo, then for the next 24 weeks, we gave half of them 2 mg of melatonin each night and the other half the placebo. Following this, we gave all patients the placebo for 2 more weeks. We measured how well these patients were thinking, their sleep quality, daily activities, and how safe this treatment was.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe patients who received melatonin for 24 weeks generally thought better and slept more efficiently than those who received the placebo. The patients with insomnia who received melatonin saw a significant improvement in how well they could think and how well they slept. This treatment was safe and well-tolerated.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAdding melatonin to Alzheimer's medication has positive results on thinking ability and sleep, especially in patients who also have insomnia. Our findings suggest that bad sleep might lead to a decline in cognitive ability."}]
