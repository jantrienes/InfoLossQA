[{"id": 4574984, "source": "PURPOSE.\nThis randomized controlled, clinical prospective interventional trial was aimed at exploring the effect of patient empowerment on short- and long-term outcomes after major oncologic surgery in elderly cancer patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis trial was performed from February 2011 to January 2014 at two tertiary medical centers in Germany. The study included patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective surgery for gastro-intestinal, genitourinary, and thoracic cancer. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group, i.e. patient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping, or to the control group, which received standard care. Randomization was done by block randomization in blocks of four in order of enrollment. The primary outcome were 1,postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) and 2. long-term global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) one year postoperatively. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative stress and complications. Further objectives were the identification of predictors of LOS, and HRQoL at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall 652 patients were included. The mean age was 72 \u00b1 4.9 years, and the majority of patients were male (68.6%, n = 447). The ^median of postoperative length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7\u201314 day). There were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups in postoperative LOS (p = 0.99) or global HRQoL after one year (women: p = 0.54, men: p = 0.94). While overall complications and major complications occurred in 74% and 24% of the cases, respectively, frequency and severity of complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly less postoperative pain (p = 0.03) than the control group. Independent predictors for LOS were identified as severity of surgery, length of anesthesia, major postoperative complications, nutritional state, and pre-operative physical functional capacity measured by the Timed Up and Go-test by multiple robust regressions.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nPatient empowerment through information booklet and diary keeping did not shorten the postoperative LOS in elderly onco-surgical patients, but improved quality of care regarding postoperative pain. Postoperative length of stay is influenced by pre-operative nutritional state, pre-operative functional impairment, severity of surgery, and length of anesthesia.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nClinicaltrials.gov. Identifier NCT01278537", "target": "PURPOSE.\nThis research was designed to see if educating older cancer patients about their surgery would affect their recovery time or their health and quality of life one year after their procedure.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween February 2011 and January 2014, the research took place in two major medical centers in Germany. We had patients who were 65 years or older who were getting surgery for stomach, urinary, and chest cancer. We randomly put these patients into two groups. One group received an information booklet and kept a diary\u2014a way to give more power to the patient. The other group was given the usual care. We measured how long they had to stay in the hospital after their surgery and their health and life quality after a year. We also looked at their stress and any complications after surgery. Lastly, we wanted to identify any factors that could predict their hospital stay and life quality at 12 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had 652 patients with an average age of around 72, and most were men. On average, patients stayed in the hospital for 9 days after their surgery. There wasn't a significant difference in hospital stay or life quality after a year between the two groups. While three out of four people had some kind of complication after the surgery, the frequency and severity were the same in both groups. However, those who received the information booklet and kept a diary reported having less pain after their surgery. The factors that determined how long patients stayed in the hospital were how severe the surgery was, how long the anesthesia lasted, any major complications after surgery, a patient's nutrition level, and their physical ability before surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nGiving patients more information about their surgery and having them keep a diary did not shorten their hospital stay. However, it did result in less reported pain after surgery. How long a patient had to stay in the hospital was determined by their nutrition level, physical ability, the severity of the surgery, and how long the anesthesia lasted.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT01278537."}]
