[{"id": 3893439, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nPersistent neuroinflammation and disruptions in brain energy metabolism is commonly seen in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because of the lack of success of most TBI interventions and the documented benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our study on use of EE in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK and uMtCK (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur results showed that EE: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mTBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and uMtCK levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur data demonstrated the potential of EE to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mTBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, EE housing was able to restore the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mTBI.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nBrain injuries often lead to long-lasting inflammation and energy disruptions in brain activities. Despite several medical treatments, their effectiveness has been limited. However, it is known that environment enrichment (EE) - an uplifting environment - can help in boosting brain recovery. This study therefore looked into how EE can help in reducing inflammation and restoring energy balance in the brain after a minor brain injury. We conducted our study on adult male rats, which either had a minor brain injury or a fake surgery. These rats were then placed in either an EE or normal living conditions. After four weeks, we tested their cognitive abilities and measured the levels of inflammatory proteins in their brain. We also checked for levels of certain proteins that regulate brain energy balance.\n\nRESULTS.\nOur findings showed that EE: (1) reduced the inflammation-causing proteins and increased healing proteins following a minor brain injury; (2) lessened the cognitive problems caused by the minor brain injury; and (3) diminished the decline in energy regulating proteins from the minor brain injury.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur study suggests that EE can help to control persistent: (1) inflammation in the brain after a minor brain injury, and (2) the ongoing disruption in brain energy balance. Through these effects, EE could help to fix the energy imbalance and improve brain recovery after a minor injury."}]
