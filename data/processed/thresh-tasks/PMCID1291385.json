[{"id": 1291385, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nThe apparent interactions between the mechanisms of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and steroids suggest that co-therapy may provide beneficial inflammatory and pain relief in the absence of side effects. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of co-administered dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium (diclofenac K) with diclofenac K alone on the postoperative pain, swelling and trismus after surgical removal of third molars.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nA prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. A total of 100 patients were randomly allocated to two treatment groups of dexamethasone (prophylactic 8 mg and postoperative 4 mg IV) and diclofenac K (50 mg Oral before and after surgery), and diclofenac K alone (as with first group). The overall analgesic efficacy of the drug combinations was assessed postoperatively by determination of pain intensity using a category rating scale. Facial swelling was measured using a tape measure placed from tragus to gonion to tragus, while interincisal mouth-opening of patients was measured using a vernier calibrated caliper pre-operatively and post-operatively.\n\nRESULTS.\nCo-administration of dexamethasone and diclofenac K was significantly superior to diclofenac alone for the relief of pain (P \u227a 0.05), and facial swelling up to post-operative 48 hour (P \u227a 0.05). However, there was no significant difference for trismus relief between the two medication protocols (P \u227b 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis study illustrates enhanced effects of co-administered dexamethasone and diclofenac K on short-term post-operative pain and swelling, compared to diclofenac potassium alone in third molar surgery.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nThis research aims to see if combining two types of medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids, can result in better relief from inflammation and pain after surgery, and with fewer side effects. The study focused on the effects of a steroid (dexamethasone) and an anti-inflammatory (diclofenac potassium) when used together, compared to just using diclofenac potassium alone. The effects were measured on patients undergoing the surgical removal of their third molars, more commonly known as wisdom teeth.\n\nRESEARCH METHODS.\nThis was a study where patients didn't know which treatment they were getting to ensure an unbiased result. It was done at a hospital in Nigeria. One hundred patients who were having their wisdom teeth removed were randomly selected and divided into two groups. One group received both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium, while the other group only received diclofenac potassium. The researchers then measured the overall effectiveness of the medications for relief from pain. They also measured the swelling of the patients' faces and the ability of their mouths to open before and after the operation.\n\nRESULTS.\nUsing both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together was found to provide significantly better relief from pain and facial swelling in the first 48 hours post-surgery compared to using diclofenac potassium alone. However, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the patient's mouth-opening ability.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAccording to this study, using both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together improves short-term relief from post-surgery pain and swelling, compared to using diclofenac potassium alone in patients getting their wisdom teeth removed."}]
