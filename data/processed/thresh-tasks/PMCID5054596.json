Body-powered prostheses are controlled through a harness connected by a cable that might provide for limited proprioceptive feedback. This study aims to test transfer of training basic tasks to functional tasks and to describe the changes over time in kinematics of basic tasks of novice body-powered prosthesis users.\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty able-bodied participants and 17 controls participated in the study, using a body-powered prosthetic simulator. Participants in the training group were divided over four groups and practiced during a 2-week-period either direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination of these tasks. Deformable objects with different compliances had to be manipulated while kinematic variables and grip force control were assessed. Functional performance was measured with the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) prior to and after the training sessions, and after 2 weeks and 3 months retention. The control group only performed the SHAP tests.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll four training groups and the control group improved on the SHAP, also after a period of non-use. Type of training had a small but significant influence on the improvements of the SHAP score. On a kinematic level movement times decreased and hook closing velocities increased over time. The indirect grasping group showed significantly shorter plateau times than the other training groups. Grip force control only improved a little over training.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTraining action-perception couplings of body-powered prosthesis in basic tasks transferred to functional tasks and this lasted after a period of non-use. During training movement times decreased and the indirect grasping group showed advantages. It is advisable to start body-powered training with indirect grasping tasks but also to practice hook-object orientations.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12984-016-0197-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "target": "Background:\nThis study looked at how people learn to use a body-powered prosthetic device. These devices are controlled by a harness and cable, and provide limited feedback to the user about limb position. The aim was to understand how practicing basic tasks could be applied to real-world tasks, and how this learning changes over time in new users of such prosthetics.\n\nMethods:\nThe study involved 30 regular people and 17 controls; all of them used a simulated prosthetic device for the study. Those in the training group were split into four sub-groups and practiced either direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination for two weeks. They had to manipulate soft objects of different hardness while researchers measured their movement and grip strength. Performance was measured before and after the training sessions, and then again after two weeks and three months of no practice. The control group only did the performance tests.\n\nResults:\nAll four training groups and the control group improved on the performance tests, even after they stopped using the device. The type of training did slightly affect how much they improved. Overall, they became faster with their movements and increased the speed at which they closed the device's hook over time. The group that practiced indirect grasping improved faster than the other groups. Grip strength didn't improve much with training.\n\nConclusions:\nPracticing basic tasks with a body-powered prosthetic device can help users get better at real-world tasks, even after they've stopped practicing. Users got faster and the group that practiced indirect grasping progressed faster. It's recommended that new users of such devices start practicing with indirect grasping tasks and also practice different ways to orient the hook.\n\nElectronic Supplementary Material:\nMore information related to the study is available online for those who are authorized to view it."}]
