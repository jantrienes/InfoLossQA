[{"id": 3921228, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nAmygdala hemodynamic responses to positive stimuli are attenuated in major depressive disorder (MDD), and normalize with remission. Real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) offers a non-invasive method to modulate this regional activity. We examined whether depressed participants can use rtfMRI-nf to enhance amygdala responses to positive autobiographical memories, and whether this ability alters symptom severity.\n\nMETHODS.\nUnmedicated MDD subjects were assigned to receive rtfMRI-nf from either left amygdala (LA; experimental group, n = 14) or the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS; control group, n = 7) and instructed to contemplate happy autobiographical memories (AMs) to raise the level of a bar representing the hemodynamic signal from the target region to a target level. This 40s Happy condition alternated with 40s blocks of rest and counting backwards. A final Transfer run without neurofeedback information was included.\n\nRESULTS.\nParticipants in the experimental group upregulated their amygdala responses during positive AM recall. Significant pre-post scan decreases in anxiety ratings and increases in happiness ratings were evident in the experimental versus control group. A whole brain analysis showed that during the transfer run, participants in the experimental group had increased activity compared to the control group in left superior temporal gyrus and temporal polar cortex, and right thalamus.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala during recall of positive AMs, depressed subjects were able to self-regulate their amygdala response, resulting in improved mood. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest that rtfMRI-nf training with positive AM recall holds potential as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of depression.", "target": "BACKGROUND:\nCertain parts of the brain called the amygdala respond less to happy things in people with depression, but this can improve when they start feeling better. One way to boost this activity in the brain is by using a special type of MRI (a brain imaging technique) known as real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf). We wanted to see if people with depression could use this technique to increase their brain's response to positive personal memories, and if this could affect their symptoms.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe worked with people who have depression but are not taking medication. We divided these individuals into two groups: one was shown rtfMRI-nf from the left amygdala and the other from a different brain area (as a comparison). These individuals were asked to think about happy personal memories to increase the level of a certain signal in the targeted brain area. They did this activity for 40 seconds, followed by rest and counting backwards. Lastly, they did another brain scan without feedback information.\n\nRESULTS:\nPeople in the first group were able to increase their amygdala's response when remembering positive personal memories. Compared to the second group, these individuals also showed a significant decrease in anxiety and an increase in happiness after scanning. When they were not given feedback, their brain activity in certain areas was increased compared to the control group.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur research suggests that people with depression were able to control their brain's response to happy memories using this special type of MRI known as rtfMRI-nf. This resulted in an improved mood. These findings provide preliminary evidence that such brain training using positive memory recall could potentially be a new way to treat depression."}]
