[{"id": 2967098, "source": "The apparent rationale for the popular use of high doses of neuroleptics in psychotic patients is to increase the degree and speed of therapeutic response .However, several recent reports have questioned these claims. The present study was undertaken with the aim to compare the efficacy of high and low oral doses of haloperidol in the treatment of acute and transient psychotic disorders. The sample comprised of forty patients of both sexes diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic disorder who were randomly assigned to high dose (20 mg/day) and low dose (5 mg /day) haloperidol groups with equal number of subjects (n=20) in both groups. Weekly assessment was done on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Haloperidol Side-effects Check List (day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 & 42). Both groups showed significant improvement in BPRS from baseline scores on all assessments. Comparison of the improvement rate in both study groups revealed no significant difference.", "target": "This study is about testing whether high or low doses of a drug called haloperidol are more effective at treating short-lasting mental illnesses. The researchers started out thinking that high doses might work better and faster, but some recent studies have disagreed with this idea. They decided to test it out themselves.\n\n40 patients - both male and female - who were experiencing a brief bout of mental illness were chosen for this study. These patients were randomly split into two groups, with one group receiving a high dose (20 mg/day) and the other receiving a low dose (5 mg/day) of haloperidol. Over a six-week period, the groups were checked weekly for any improvement in their symptoms and side effects from the drug.\n\nIn the end, both groups showed significant recovery from their initial symptoms at every check-up. When they compared the two groups, the researchers found no notable difference in how much the patients improved. So, it didn't really matter whether they were given a high or low dose - they ended up getting better around the same amount."}]
