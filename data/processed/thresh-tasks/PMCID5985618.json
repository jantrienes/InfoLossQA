[{"id": 5985618, "source": "INTRODUCTION.\nHalitosis and foreign body sensation are two common and disturbing symptoms of chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency (TC-RF) tonsil ablation with CO2-laser cryptolysis (CO2-LC) in the treatment of patients with halitosis caused by CCT.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nSixty-two patients who suffered from halitosis and/or foreign body sensation due to CCT were enrolled in the present randomized clinical trial, and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A underwent TC-RF tonsil ablation and Group B received CO2-LC. The severity of symptoms including halitosis and foreign body sensation was reported 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. Patient pain levels and amount of bleeding were evaluated as safety outcome measures. Pain levels were evaluated during the intervention, and at Day 1, 3, and 7 following the procedure using a visual analog scale (VAS).\n\nRESULTS.\nMean rank of pain score in the RF tonsil ablation group was found to be higher than in the CO2-LC group at all measured timepoints following the procedure. The amount of bleeding in the LC group was found to be significantly less than in the RF group (P\u227a0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding duration of procedure (P=0.157).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth procedures were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of CT-associated halitosis. However, LC showed better results based on lower pain levels, lower incidence of bleeding, and faster progression to a routine diet.", "target": "INTRODUCTION.\nBad breath and a sensation of a foreign body are common symptoms of a chronic issue called tonsillitis where there's a cheesy substance in the throat. This study aimed to compare two treatments: one using controlled temperature radio waves and the other using a type of laser, to treat bad breath caused by this condition.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nWe had 62 people in the study who had bad breath and/or these feelings from their throat issue. They were split into two groups. One group received the treatment with radio waves and the other with the laser. We monitored how severe the symptoms were after a week, a month, and then six months after treatment. We also noted any pain suffered and any bleeding as measures of how safe it was. The pain was measured when the treatment was happening and on days 1, 3, and 7 after the treatment using a rating scale.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that the group treated with radio waves suffered more pain than the laser group at all times we checked after the procedure. The laser group had less bleeding than the radio wave group, a significant difference. However, the time for both procedures to complete wasn't significantly different.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBoth treatments were found to be effective and safe for treating chronic tonsillitis-associated bad breath. However, the laser showed better results as it caused less pain, less bleeding, and allowed patients to return to their normal diet sooner."}]
