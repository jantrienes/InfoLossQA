[{"id": 165418, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nDepression is prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes and affects both glycemic control and overall quality of life. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the antidepressant paroxetine on metabolic control, quality of life and mental well-being in mildly depressed women with type 2 diabetes.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe randomised 15 mildly depressed women with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes to a 10-week single-blind treatment with either paroxetine 20 mg per day or placebo. Primary efficacy measurements were glycemic control and quality of life. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (GHbA1c) was used as a measure of glycemic control. Quality of life was evaluated using RAND-36. Mental state was assessed using two clinician-rated scoring instruments, Hamilton's Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg's Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and a patient-rated scoring instrument, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI).\n\nRESULTS.\nAt the end of the study no significant difference between groups in improvement of quality of life was found. A trend towards a superior improvement in glycemic control was found in the paroxetine group (p = 0.08). A superior increase in sex-hormone-binding-globuline (SHBG) levels was evidenced in the paroxetine group (p = 0.01) as a sign of improved insulin sensitivity. There was also a trend for superior efficacy of paroxetine in investigator-rated anxiety and depression. This notion was supported by a trend for superior decrease of serum cortisol levels in the paroxetine group (p = 0.06).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nParoxetine has a beneficial effect on measures of insulin sensitivity and may improve glycemic control. Larger studies of longer duration are needed to verify the benefits of paroxetine in type 2 diabetes. While waiting for more conclusive evidence it seems sensible to augment standard care of type 2 diabetes with paroxetine even in patients who do not fulfil routine psychiatric criteria for initiation of antidepressant drug treatment.", "target": "BACKGROUND:\nPeople with type 2 diabetes often also struggle with depression. This depression can make it harder for them to keep their blood sugar levels in check and reduce their quality of life. This study wanted to see if an antidepressant drug called paroxetine could help these people by improving their blood sugar control, quality of life, and mental health.\n\nMETHODS:\nThe study included 15 women with type 2 diabetes who were a little depressed and not succeeding at controlling their blood sugar. These women were randomly picked to take paroxetine or a placebo for 10 weeks. The researchers then checked to see how well their blood sugar was controlled and their quality of life using several techniques including a blood test, a popular health survey, and mental health evaluations.\n\nRESULTS:\nAt the end of the study, there wasn't a big difference in the quality of life improvements between the two groups. However, the group taking paroxetine seemed to have slightly better blood sugar control. They also saw an increase in a protein that indicates improved insulin sensitivity, meaning their bodies could use insulin more effectively. Additionally, the paroxetine group showed signs of reduced anxiety and depression, as well as a decrease in a stress hormone.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nParoxetine might help improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Larger and longer studies are needed to confirm these benefits. But until then, it might make sense to add paroxetine to the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes patients, even if they're not extremely depressed."}]
