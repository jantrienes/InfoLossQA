[{"id": 4984916, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nIn the United Kingdom, totally implantable venous access systems (TIVAS) are not routinely used. Compared with Hickman catheters, these devices are more expensive and complex to insert. However, it is unclear whether the higher costs may be offset by perceived greater health benefits. This pilot trial aimed to generate relevant data to inform the design of a larger definitive randomised controlled trial.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis was a phase II prospective, randomised, open trial from two UK oncology centres. The primary end point was overall complication rate. Secondary end points included individual complication rates, time to first complication and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. An economic evaluation was also carried out.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 100 patients were randomised in a 3 : 1 ratio to receive a Hickman or a TIVAS. Overall, 54% of patients in the Hickman arm suffered one or more complications compared with 38% in the TIVAS arm (one-sided P=0.068). In the Hickman arm, 28% of the devices were removed prematurely due to a complication compared with 4% in the TIVAS arm. Quality of life based on the device-specific questionnaire was greater in the TIVAS arm for 13 of the 16 questions. The economic evaluation showed that Hickman arm was associated with greater mean cost per patient \u00a31803 (95% CI 462, 3215), but similar quality-adjusted life years \u22120.01 (95% CI \u22120.15, 0.15) than the TIVAS arm. However, there is much uncertainty associated with the results.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nCompared with Hickman catheters, TIVAS may be the cost-effective option. A larger multicentre trial is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nIn the UK, we don't often use totally implantable venous access systems (TIVAS). These are devices that allow doctors to access your veins for treatments or taking blood samples. They're more expensive and trickier to put in than the usually used Hickman catheters. We're not sure if the extra costs of TIVAS might be worth it because of possible health benefits. We ran a small trial to get more information and help design a bigger, more detailed trial later.\n\nMETHODS.\nThis trial involved two cancer centres in the UK and was organized to observe and compare the use of Hickman catheters and TIVAS. We looked at how many problems arose overall and for each treatment, how long it took for the first problem to happen, and how patients\u2019 quality of life was affected. We also looked at the economic impact of each treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had 100 patients divide into two groups for the trial. More than half of those with the Hickman catheter had one or more problems, while less than half with the TIVAS system did. In the Hickman group, about a third had to have their catheter removed early because of problems, while only a tiny portion in the TIVAS group did. Based on a questionnaire, patients with TIVAS were happier with their treatment in most areas. Cost-wise, using the Hickman catheter was more expensive per person. However, when we consider quality of life adjustment, the costs were about the same. But again, these results are not confirmed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTIVAS devices might be the more cost-effective option compared to Hickman catheters. We need to do a larger trial in more centres to be more sure of these findings."}]
