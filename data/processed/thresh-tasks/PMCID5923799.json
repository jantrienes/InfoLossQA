[{"id": 5923799, "source": "Purpose: Children from multicultural families face physical, social, mental, and intellectual hurdles; however, relative interventions are lacking in South Korea (hereafter Korea) in this regard. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of regular Taekwondo (TKD) training on physical fitness, mood, sociability, and cognitive functions in these children. Methods: This study included 30 children from multicultural families in Korea who were randomly assigned to a TKD group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). The children in TKD group underwent 16 weeks of TKD training once a week for 60 min. Each participant underwent a basic fitness test and sociability questionnaire before and after the intervention. Furthermore, we examined the changes in the mood and cognitive function by determining the profile of mood states (POMS), and Stroop color and word test, respectively. Results: Results of the Stork test of balance were significantly higher in the TKD group after intervention (p \u227a 0.05). In terms of sub-variables, POMS, tension, and depression scores were significantly lower (p \u227a 0.05) after the intervention, while the vigor score was significantly higher in the intervention group than those in the control group (p \u227a 0.05). Furthermore, sociability and 'being left out' score, a sub-variable of sociability, was significantly lower (p \u227a 0.05) after the intervention, while sociability score was significantly higher (p \u227a 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that participation in regular TKD training can be effective for balanced improvements in variables of basic fitness and that it exerts a positive effect on the mood and development of sociability.", "target": "Purpose: In South Korea, children from families with diverse cultural backgrounds often face challenges regarding their physical, social, mental, and intellectual development. Not enough action is taken to see if activities like Taekwondo can improve these areas. We wanted to find out if regular Taekwondo classes can improve fitness, mood, social skills, and thinking abilities in these children. \n\nMethods: For our study, we had 30 children from multicultural families. We divided them into two groups: 15 children attended Taekwondo sessions once a week for 16 weeks, and the other 15 children didn't. We measured their fitness levels and how well they socialize by using questionnaires before and after the Taekwondo classes. We also evaluated changes in their mood and ability to think by examining their state of mind and their performance in a color and word test. \n\nResults: The balance of the children who participated in Taekwondo improved significantly. They experienced less tension and depression, as well as increased energy levels compared to the other group. Their social skills also improved, and they felt less left out after the Taekwondo program. \n\nConclusions: The results suggest that regular Taekwondo training can improve basic fitness levels, mood, and social abilities in children from families with multiple cultural backgrounds."}]
