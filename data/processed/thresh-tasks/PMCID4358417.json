[{"id": 4358417, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nObesity has become a great problem all over the world. We repeatedly screened to find an effective food to treat obesity and discovered that rosehip extract shows potent anti-obesity effects. Investigations in mice have demonstrated that rosehip extract inhibits body weight gain and decreases visceral fat. Thus, the present study examined the effect of rosehip extract on human body fat in preobese subjects.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a 12-week, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 32 subjects who had a body mass index of \u226525 but \u227a30. The subjects were assigned to two random groups, and they received one tablet of placebo or rosehip that contained 100 mg of rosehip extract once each day for 12 weeks with no dietary intervention. Abdominal fat area and body fat percent were measured as primary outcomes. The other outcomes were body weight and body mass index.\n\nRESULTS.\nAbdominal total fat area, abdominal visceral fat area, body weight, and body mass index decreased significantly in the rosehip group at week 12 compared with their baseline levels (P\u227a0.01) after receiving the rosehip tablet intake, and the decreases in these parameters were significantly higher when compared with those in the placebo group. Additionally, body fat percent tended to decrease compared with the placebo group and their baseline level. Moreover, the abdominal subcutaneous fat area was significantly lower in the rosehip group than in the placebo group at week 12 after the initiation of intake (P\u227a0.05). In addition, there were no abnormalities, subjective symptoms, and findings that may indicate clinical problems during the study period.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThese results suggest that rosehip extract may be a good candidate food material for preventing obesity.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nObesity is a big issue worldwide. In our search for food that can help tackle obesity, we found that rosehip extract can help reduce weight gain and cut down belly fat, as shown in tests on mice. Now, we want to see if it works on humans too, in people who are a little overweight.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe ran a 12-week experiment involving 32 people who were slightly overweight. They were divided into two groups, with one group given a placebo (dummy pill), and the other given a rosehip tablet containing 100mg of rosehip extract. They took one pill every day for 12 weeks, and didn\u2019t change their eating habits. We looked at changes in belly fat and body fat percentage mainly, as well as any changes in body weight and BMI (body mass index).\n\nRESULTS.\nThose in the rosehip group lost a significant amount of belly fat, weight, and had a lower BMI by the end of the 12 weeks. These reductions were much more significant compared to the placebo group. There was also a trend towards a lower body fat percentage in the rosehip group. Moreover, the fat just under the skin in the belly area was significantly lower in the rosehip group than the placebo group by week 12. Also, there were no health problems reported during the study.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThese findings suggest that rosehip extract might be a good potential food item to help prevent obesity."}]
