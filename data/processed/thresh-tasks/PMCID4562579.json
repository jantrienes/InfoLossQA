[{"id": 4562579, "source": "Step-reduction (SR) in older adults results in muscle atrophy and an attenuated rise in postprandial muscle protein synthesis (MPS): anabolic resistance. Knowing that resistance exercise (RT) can enhance MPS, we examined whether RT could enhance MPS following 2 weeks of SR. In addition, as we postulated that SR may impair feeding-induced vasodilation limiting nutrient delivery to muscle, we also examined whether citrulline (CIT), as an arginine and nitric oxide precursor, could attenuate muscle anabolic resistance accompanying SR. We used a unilateral leg model to compare older subjects' who had undergone SR to a loaded condition of SR plus RT (SR + RT). Thirty older men (70 \u00b1 1 years) underwent 14 days of SR (\u227a1500 steps/day) with supplementation of either 5 g/day CIT or glycine placebo. Throughout SR, subjects performed unilateral low-load RT thrice weekly. We assessed muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive and postprandial state (20 g whey isolate plus 15 g glycine or as micellar-whey with 5 g CIT or 15 g glycine, n = 10/group). As MPS was similar after ingestion of either whey isolate, micellar-whey, or micellar-whey + CIT data related to different dietary groups were collapsed to compare SR and SR + RT legs. Subjects' daily steps were reduced by 80 \u00b1 2% during SR (P \u227a 0.001) compared with baseline. Leg fat-free mass decreased with SR (\u2212124 \u00b1 61 g) and increased in the SR + RT (+126 \u00b1 68 g; P = 0.003). Myofibrillar FSR was lower (P \u227a 0.0001) in the SR as compared with the SR + RT leg in the postabsorptive (0.026 \u00b1 0.001%/h vs. 0.045 \u00b1 0.001%/h) and postprandial states (0.055 \u00b1 0.002%/h vs. 0.115 \u00b1 0.003%/h). We conclude that low-load RT, but not supplementation with CIT, can attenuate the deleterious effects of SR in aging muscle.", "target": "This study explores how taking fewer steps (called Step-Reduction or SR) can make older adults' muscles weaker, and slow down the process of their bodies making proteins after eating - a process known as \"anabolic resistance\". The researchers wanted to know if doing resistance exercises (like lifting weights) could help boost this protein creation process, especially after a period of reduced activity. They also wondered if consuming citrulline (a substance that helps widen blood vessels) could counteract the negative impact of less movement by improving nutrient delivery to the muscles.\n\n30 older men (around 70 years old) were asked to reduce their daily steps to less than 1500 for two weeks. They were given either citrulline or a placebo (a substance with no effect), and did light resistance exercise with one of their legs. After the two weeks, the researchers checked the protein creation in their muscles both before and after meals, using different protein supplements.\n\nThe results showed that doing resistance exercise helped curb the negative effects of taking fewer steps, such as muscle loss, and improved the protein creation process after meals. However, taking citrulline didn't have any significant effect. The study suggests that resistance exercise can help older adults maintain healthy muscles, even if they are less active."}]
