[{"id": 3659039, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nEicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are functionally the most important omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Oral supply of these fatty acids increases their levels in plasma and cell membranes, often at the expense of the omega-6 PUFAs arachidonic acid (ARA) and linoleic acid. This results in an altered pattern of lipid mediator production to one which is less pro-inflammatory. We investigated whether short term intravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs could change the levels of EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid in plasma and erythrocytes in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwenty patients were randomised to receive a 72 hour infusion of total parenteral nutrition with (treatment group) or without (control group) omega-3 PUFAs. EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid were measured in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) and erythrocytes at several times points up to the end of infusion and 5 to 12 days (mean 9 days) after stopping the infusion.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe treatment group showed increases in plasma PC EPA and DHA and erythrocyte EPA and decreases in plasma PC and erythrocyte linoleic acid, with effects most evident late in the infusion period. Plasma PC and erythrocyte EPA and linoleic acid all returned to baseline levels after the 5\u201312 day washout. Plasma PC DHA remained elevated above baseline after washout.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIntravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs results in a rapid increase of EPA and DHA in plasma PC and of EPA in erythrocytes. These findings suggest that infusion of omega-3 PUFAs could be used to induce a rapid effect especially in targeting inflammation.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nhttp://www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00942292", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nOmega-3 fatty acids, such as Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are very important for our body. When we take these acids orally, their levels increase in our blood and cell walls, which reduces inflammation. This study examined whether giving omega-3 fatty acids directly into a patient's veins could change the amounts of EPA, DHA, and other fatty acids in the blood of patients with liver cancer that originated from the colon or rectum.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwenty patients were chosen at random to receive a 3-day intravenous nutrition treatment, either with or without (control group) omega-3 fatty acids. The fatty acids EPA, DHA, and others were measured in the blood plasma and red blood cells several times during and after the treatment.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe group of patients who received omega-3 fatty acids showed increases in EPA and DHA levels and decreases in other fatty acid levels. These changes were have been found to be most significant late in the treatment period. Except for DHA levels, all others returned to normal 5-12 days after stopping the treatment. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nGiving omega-3 fatty acids directly into a patient's veins leads to a quick increase in some fatty acids, which suggests that this method could be used to quickly target inflammation especially.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis trial was officially registered with the identifier NCT00942292 at www.clinicaltrials.gov."}]
