[{"id": 5506697, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nWe examined the efficacy of olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) in improving health-related quality of life (QoL) in the treatment of bipolar depression in children and adolescents.\n\nMETHODS.\nPatients aged 10\u201317 years with bipolar I disorder, depressed episode, baseline children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) total score \u226540, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score \u226415, and YMRS-item 1 \u2264 2 were randomized to OFC (6/25\u201312/50 mg/day olanzapine/fluoxetine; n = 170) or placebo (n = 85) for up to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Patients and parents completed the revised KINDL questionnaire for measuring health-related QoL in children and adolescents (KINDL-R) at baseline and endpoint. The mean change in CDRS-R total and item scores were used to compare improvement in symptomatology in patients taking OFC and placebo. Tests were 2-sided using a Type I error cutoff of 0.05, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.\n\nRESULTS.\nBaseline QoL as measured by the KINDL-R was substantially impaired relative to published norms for a healthy school-based sample. OFC-treated patients demonstrated an improvement over placebo at endpoint with respect to mean change from baseline in the patient-rated KINDL-R Self-esteem subscale score (p = 0.028), and in the parent KINDL-R ratings of emotional well-being (p = 0.020), Self-esteem (p = 0.030), and Family (p = 0.006). At endpoint, OFC-treated patients still had a lower QoL compared to the normative population. OFC showed significant improvement (p \u2264 0.05) versus placebo on the CDRS-R total score and on 7 of the 17 CDRS-R items.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nPatients aged 10\u201317 years with an acute episode of bipolar depression and their parents reported greater improvements (parents noticed improvements in more areas than did their offspring) on some aspects of QoL when treated with OFC compared with placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, KINDL-R endpoint scores remained lower than those of the, presumably healthy, control population.  \nClinical trial registration information A Study for Assessing Treatment of Patients Ages 10\u201317 with Bipolar Depression; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00844857", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looked at whether a combination of two drugs, olanzapine and fluoxetine (OFC), is effective in helping improve the life quality of kids and teenagers suffering from bipolar depression. \n\nMETHODS.\nPatients between the ages of 10 and 17 who have bipolar I disorder and are currently in a depressive phase were selected for this study. These patients were then divided into two groups: one received the drug combination (OFC), and the other received a placebo (a substance with no treatment effect). They were treated for up to 8 weeks. Using a questionnaire filled out by both patients and their parents at the beginning and end of the study, we were able to measure their life quality. We also checked the degree of depression symptoms by comparing scores of specific scales before and after treatment. \n\nRESULTS.\nAt the start of the study, the patients' quality of life was much lower than what you'd expect from a healthy child or teenager of the same age. After treatment, those who received the drug combination showed improvement in how they felt about themselves and in their emotional well-being, according to both the children and their parents. The parents also noted improvements in family dynamics. However, even after treatment, these patients' quality of life remained lower than that of a typical healthy child or teenager. The group that received the drug combination also demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared to the placebo group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nBased on the study, children and teenagers experiencing a depressive phase of bipolar disorder, as well as their parents, reported better improvements in some aspects of life quality when treated with the drug combination than with the placebo. However, after 8 weeks of treatment, their life quality was still lower than that of their healthy peers.
