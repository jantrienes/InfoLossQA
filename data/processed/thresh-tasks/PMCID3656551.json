[{"id": 3656551, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nImproved influenza vaccine strategies for infants and preschool children are a high priority.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe immunological response and safety of a thimerosal-free trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine at 2 different doses (0.50 mL vs 0.25 mL) was evaluated in children aged 6\u201335 months. The study was randomized, observer blind, multicenter, and stratified by age (6\u201323 months and 24\u201335 months), and it accounted for prior influenza immunization status.\n\nRESULTS.\nThree hundred seventy-four children were in the total vaccinated cohort (study vaccine 0.25-mL dose, n = 164; 0.50-mL dose, n = 167; comparator 0.25 mL, n = 43). Regulatory criteria for immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in adults were met for all virus strains and doses for both age strata. A modest but not statistically significant improvement in immune responses was observed with the higher dose and reactogenicity, and safety of the 2 doses was not significantly different.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe 0.5-mL dose of the study vaccine, when administered to children aged 6\u201335 months, resulted in a modest but not statistically significant improvement in immunogenicity with clinically similar safety and reactogenicity compared with the 0.25-mL dose. Further studies comparing full- and half-dose influenza vaccine in young children are needed.\n\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION.\nNCT00778895.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nWe're trying to find better ways to vaccinate babies and young children against the flu.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe tested a flu vaccine (that doesn't contain a preservative called thimerosal) at two different amounts (0.50ml and 0.25ml) in kids aged between 6 and 35 months. Our study was designed and conducted carefully, with the researcher not knowing who received what amount of the vaccine. We also considered what flu shots the children had had before.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe tested the vaccine on 374 children. The effectiveness (how well it boosts the immune system) of the vaccine for all three virus strains in the vaccine met the standards set for adults, and it didn't matter how much of the vaccine the kids got or how old they were. We found a small improvement in the immune response with the larger dose, but the difference wasn't significant. The two different doses had similar safety levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nGiving kids aged 6-35 months the larger dose (0.5ml) of this flu vaccine made a small improvement, but it wasn't a significant difference. Importantly, it was equally safe and well-tolerated as the smaller dose (0.25ml). We need more studies testing larger and smaller amounts of flu vaccine in young children.\n\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION.\nYou can look up the details of our study using the identifier NCT00778895."}]
