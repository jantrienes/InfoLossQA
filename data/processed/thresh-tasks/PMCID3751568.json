[{"id": 3751568, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nKnee pain in children with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) is traditionally managed with exercise, however the supporting evidence for this is scarce. No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed affects outcomes.\n\nMETHODS.\nA prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment. Assessors were blinded to the participants\u2019 treatment allocation and participants blinded to the difference in the treatments.\n\nRESULTS.\nChildren with JHS and knee pain (n=26) aged 7-16 years were randomly assigned to the hypermobile (n=12) or neutral (n=14) treatment group. Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 \u2013 23.8 mm, p=0.003). Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only to neutral (p=0.037). No other differences were found between groups and no adverse events occurred.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParents perceive improved child psychosocial health when children exercise into the hypermobile range, while exercising to neutral only is perceived to favour the child\u2019s physical health. A physiotherapist prescribed, supervised, individualised and progressed exercise programme effectively reduces knee pain in children with JHS.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nAustralia & New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ACTRN12606000109505.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nHypermobile joints (joints that can move beyond normal limits) can cause knee pain in children. While exercise is the usual way to help with this condition, not much solid proof supports this approach. This study had two goals: to see if a knee-strength exercise program, designed by a physiotherapist, can reduce knee pain compared to doing nothing, and to check if the specific way exercises are performed influences how they work.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe study took place in a major hospital in Sydney, Australia, and involved a group of children who were put into two separate exercise programs for eight weeks. One group did exercises into their hypermobile range, and the other group did exercises following their normal movement range. The study period started after at least two weeks of no treatment. The kids were put into groups randomly by a computer program. The main measure was how much knee pain the child reported. We also measured quality of life, leg strength, and function in three stages: before the study, after the initial no treatment period, and after the exercise program ended. The people assessing the results didn't know which group the children were in, and the kids didn't know the differences between the two treatments.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe 26 children participating, aged between 7-16, were split into the hypermobile (12 children) or neutral (14 children) movement groups. Both groups reported that their knee pain lessened significantly after treatment\u2014an average of 14.5 units decrease on the pain scale. In terms of emotional health, parents reported that kids who exercised into the hypermobile range had better self-esteem, emotional health, and behavior. As for physical health, parents thought kids who kept to their normal movement range were better off. There were no other significant differences between the two groups and no bad side effects happened.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIt appears that parents observe improved emotional health in children who exercise in their hypermobile range, while exercising within normal range seems to benefit the child\u2019s physical wellbeing. Therefore, a knee-strength exercise program supervised by a physiotherapist can effectively reduce knee pain for kids having hypermobile joints.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry."}]
