[{"id": 5682159, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nPatient-reported outcomes are important measures when assessing the efficacy of aesthetic procedures.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nTo compare outcomes between 2 volumizing hyaluronic acid fillers.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nSubjects with moderate-to-severe volume loss in the cheeks were randomized in a split-face design to malar enhancement with Cohesive Polydensified Matrix 26 mg/ml HA (CPM-26) and Vycross 20 mg/ml HA (VYC-20). The same injection technique and injection volume were applied for both sides of the face. Anesthetics, overcorrection, and touch-ups were not permitted. Blinded subjects assessed aesthetic improvements using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale and treatment satisfaction by confirming their willingness to repeat treatment or recommend it to friends. Follow-up was 18 months.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 45 subjects received a single 2 mL injection of CPM-26 on one side and VYC-20 on the contralateral side of the face. The proportion of subjects reporting improvement on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale compared with baseline for CPM-26 and VYC-20 was 97.7% and 88.6%, respectively, at 3 months, 73.8% and 71.1% at 12 months, and 61.0% and 56.7% at 18 months. Treatment satisfaction was high, with the majority of subjects stating that they would repeat treatment and recommend it to friends, but at each time point, a higher proportion of subjects was more satisfied with the CPM-26-treated side of the face.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn this first direct comparison of CPM-26 and VYC-20, the majority of subjects were satisfied with both treatments throughout the study. Patient-reported outcome measures identified a trend in favor of CPM-26.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nThis study looks at the results of different face-enhancing treatments based on patient\u2019s feedback, which is really important to know if a beauty procedure works or not.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThe aim is to see which of two specific face fillers gives better outcomes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nPeople who had some loss of plumpness in their cheeks were divided evenly: one side of the face was treated with a filler called CPM-26, and the other with a filler called VYC-20. The same amount of filler was used on both sides of the face, without using any extra anesthetics, fillers or touch-ups later. People were then asked to judge how much better they looked and whether they were happy with the treatment and would use it again or suggest it to others. The study followed up with them for 18 months.\n\nRESULTS.\n45 people took part in the research and received a single injection of 2ml of each filler on both sides of the face. When they compared their looks before and after the treatment, at 3 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years, more people were pleased with the results of CPM-26. They were also more likely to say they would use the same treatment again or recommend it to friends. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nFirst-time comparison of these two fillers shows that most people were happy with both of them. But the one called CPM-26 was slightly more preferred by the patients."}]
