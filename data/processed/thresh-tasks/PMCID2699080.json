[{"id": 2699080, "source": "BACKGROUND.\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) causes hydronephrosis and progressive renal impairment may ensue if left uncorrected. Open pyeloplasty remains the standard against which new technique must be compared. We compared laparoscopic (LP) and open pyeloplasty (OP) in a randomized prospective trial.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS.\nA prospective randomized study was done from January 2004 to January 2007 in which a total of 28 laparoscopic and 34 open pyeloplasty were done. All laparoscopic pyeloplasties were performed transperitoneally. Standard open Anderson Hynes pyeloplasty, spiral flap or VY plasty was done depending on anatomic consideration. Patients were followed with DTPA scan at three months and IVP at six months. Perioperative parameters including operative time, analgesic use, hospital stay, and complication and success rates were compared.\n\nRESULTS.\nMean total operative time with stent placement in LP group was 244.2 min (188-300 min) compared to 122 min (100-140 min) in OP group. Compared to OP group, the post operative diclofenac requirement was significantly less in LP group (mean 107.14 mg) and OP group required mean of (682.35 mg). The duration of analgesic requirement was also significantly less in LP group. The postoperative hospital stay in LP was mean 3.14 Days (2-7 days) significantly less than the open group mean of 8.29 days (7-11 days).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nLP has a minimal level of morbidity and short hospital stay compared to open approach. Although, laparoscopic pyeloplasty has the disadvantages of longer operative time and requires significant skill of intracorporeal knotting but it is here to stay and represents an emerging standard of care.", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is a condition that can lead to kidney problems if not treated. The traditional treatment is a type of surgery known as open pyeloplasty. In this study, we compared this traditional treatment to a newer technique called laparoscopic pyeloplasty.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, we performed 28 laparoscopic and 34 open pyeloplasty surgeries. The laparoscopic surgeries were performed through the abdominal cavity. The traditional surgeries were done based on the patient's specific needs. After surgery, we monitored patients with scans. We also compared how long the surgeries took, how much pain medication was used, how long patients stayed in the hospital, and the rates of complications and success.\n\nRESULTS.\nOn average, the laparoscopic surgeries took longer. However, the patients who had laparoscopic surgery needed significantly less pain medication and stayed in the hospital for a shorter amount of time.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nLaparoscopic surgery has some downsides, such as the longer surgery time and the advanced skills required. However, these surgeries have lower risks and quicker recovery times. Thus, laparoscopic surgery is becoming a new standard for treating this condition."}]
