[{"id": 4231047, "source": "BACKGROUND/AIM.\nTargeted radiotherapy of liver malignancies has found to be effective in selected patients. A key limiting factor of these therapies is the relatively low tolerance of the liver parenchyma to radiation. We sought to assess the preventive effects of a combined regimen of pentoxifylline (PTX), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on focal radiation-induced liver injury (fRILI).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS.\nPatients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma who were scheduled for local ablation by radiotherapy (image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy) were prospectively randomized to receive PTX, UDCA and LMWH for 8 weeks (treatment) or no medication (control). Focal RILI at follow-up was assessed using functional hepatobiliary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A minimal threshold dose, i.e. the dose to which the outer rim of the fRILI was formerly exposed to, was quantified by merging MRI and dosimetry data.\n\nRESULTS.\nResults from an intended interim-analysis made a premature termination necessary. Twenty-two patients were included in the per-protocol analysis. Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in the study treatment-group compared with the control (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). Qualitative evidence of fRILI by MRI at 6 weeks was observed in 45.5% of patients in the treatment versus 90.9% of the control group. No significant differences between the groups were observed at the 12-week follow-up.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe post-therapeutic application of PTX, UDCA and low-dose LMWH significantly reduced the extent and incidence fRILI at 6 weeks after radiotherapy. The development of subsequent fRILI at 12 weeks (4 weeks after cessation of PTX, UDCA and LMWH during weeks 1\u20138) in the treatment group was comparable to the control group thus supporting the observation that the agents mitigated fRILI.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nEU clinical trials register 2008-002985-70 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01149304", "target": "BACKGROUND.\nUsing targeted radiation to treat liver cancers can be effective in some patients. However, the liver can only handle a limited amount of radiation before it starts to get damaged. We looked into whether a combination treatment of three drugs - pentoxifylline (PTX), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) - could prevent radiation-induced liver injury.\n\nMETHODS.\nPeople with liver cancer spread from colon cancer who were set for radiation treatment were included. They were randomly chosen to receive either the combination treatment for 8 weeks or no extra medication. We looked for signs of radiation-induced liver injury using a specific type of MRI scan. We also calculated the smallest radiation dose that caused injury by combining MRI results and radiation dose data.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had to stop the study early due to early results. We included 22 patients in the final report. The smallest dose that caused liver injury 6 weeks after radiation treatment was significantly higher in the group receiving the combination treatment compared to the group without (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). At 6 weeks, 45.5% of the treated group showed signs of liver injury compared with 90.9% of the untreated group. There were no noticeable differences between the groups at 12 weeks.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTaking PTX, UDCA and low-dose LMWH after radiation treatment considerably reduced liver injury at 6 weeks after radiation treatment. However, 4 weeks after stopping the drug combination (which was given during weeks 1-8), incidences of liver injury in the treated group were like those in the control group. This supports the notion that these drugs can minimize radiation-induced liver injury. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in the EU clinical trials register (2008-002985-70) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01149304)."}]
