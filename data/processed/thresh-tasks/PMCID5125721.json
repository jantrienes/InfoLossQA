[{"id": 5125721, "source": "Tartary buckwheat (TB) has been reported to be associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and T2DM has had a major impact on the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Thus, the hypothesis that a daily intake of TB will improve DKD risk factors, including urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), urea nitrogen (UN), serum creatinine, and uric acid was tested. In a parallel, randomized, open-label controlled trial, 104 T2DM patients were randomly assigned to a diet control group (systematic diet plans and intensive nutritional education) or a TB intervention group (daily replacement of a portion of staple foods with TB foods). Blood samples and dietary information were collected at baseline and the end of the 4-week study. The primary outcomes were that TB significantly decreased the rela tive changes in UACR (2.43\u20132.35, logarithmic transformed mg/g creatinine) and UN (5.12\u20134.91 mmol/L) in the TB intervention group vs the diet control group at 4 weeks (P\u227a0.05), without obvious effect on blood glucose during the 4-week study. In addition, subgroup analyses based on different DKD stages also showed a significant reduction in UACR and UN for the T2DM patients with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria (P\u227a0.05). These results support the hypothesis that TB as a replacement of staple food probably alleviates renal dysfunction in T2DM patients.", "target": "Tartary buckwheat (TB) is a food that may help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Since type 2 diabetes can often lead to kidney disease, it could be that eating TB on a daily basis can help improve the chances of not getting kidney disease.\n\nIn this study, 104 people with type 2 diabetes were divided into two groups. One group stuck to their normal diet but had lessons on nutrition and food. The other group replaced some of their daily food with TB. After four weeks of this, blood samples and food diaries were collected from all participants.\n\nThe results showed that eating TB everyday lowered some of the markers that indicates risk of kidney disease for those people in the TB food group. These markers were the 'urinary albumin to creatinine ratio' and 'urea nitrogen'. However, it did not seem to impact blood sugar levels over this four weeks. Further checks on sub groups based on their stage of kidney disease also showed a similar result. \n\nSo, the study supports the idea that replacing some daily food with TB can likely reduce kidney problems in people with type 2 diabetes. It seems like a simple and effective way for diabetes patients to improve their kidney health."}]
