[{"title":"Metabolic effect of telmisartan and losartan in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nMetabolic syndrome is a cluster of common cardiovascular risk factors that includes hypertension and insulin resistance. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are frequent comorbidities and, like metabolic syndrome, increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Telmisartan, an antihypertensive agent with evidence of partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) activity, may improve insulin sensitivity and lipid profile in patients with metabolic syndrome.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized study, patients with World Health Organization criteria for metabolic syndrome received once-daily doses of telmisartan (80 mg, n = 20) or losartan (50 mg, n = 20) for 3 months. At baseline and end of treatment, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity, glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) and 24-hour mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were determined.\n\nRESULTS.\nTelmisartan, but not losartan, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced free plasma glucose, free plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and HbAic. Following treatment, plasma glucose and insulin were reduced during the oral glucose tolerance test by telmisartan, but not by losartan. Telmisartan also significantly reduced 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05) compared with losartan.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAs well as providing superior 24-hour blood pressure control, telmisartan, unlike losartan, displayed insulin-sensitizing activity, which may be explained by its partial PPAR\u03b3 activity.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":1174877,"simplification":"BACKGROUND.\nMetabolic syndrome is a mix of health conditions that can put you at risk of heart disease. It includes things like high blood pressure and the body's resistance to insulin, a hormone that manages the sugar in your body. Both high blood pressure and a type of diabetes are often found with metabolic syndrome and they make the risk of heart disease even higher. Telmisartan is a medication taken to lower high blood pressure, and it might also help the body respond better to insulin and improve blood fat levels in people with metabolic syndrome.\n\nMETHODS.\nIn a study which kept the patients and researchers blind to the treatment received, people with metabolic syndrome criteria defined by the World Health Organization were given either Telmisartan or another high blood pressure medication called Losartan daily for three months. At the beginning and end of treatment, we measured fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, insulin responsiveness, the percentage of sugar coating on red blood cells (HbA1c), and average blood pressures throughout a day.\n\nRESULTS.\nTelmisartan was found to notably lower fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin, the measure of insulin resistance, and HbA1c. After taking Telmisartan, patients had lower blood sugar and insulin levels after eating sugar, which wasn't the case with Losartan. Telmisartan also significantly lowered the average blood pressure throughout the day, more so than Losartan.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nBesides better control of blood pressure throughout the day, Telmisartan was found to enhance the body's insulin response while Losartan did not. This could be related to Telmisartan's potential to partially provoke a specific activity in the body (PPAR\u03b3)."},{"title":"Effects of co-administered dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium on pain, swelling and trismus following third molar surgery","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nThe apparent interactions between the mechanisms of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and steroids suggest that co-therapy may provide beneficial inflammatory and pain relief in the absence of side effects. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of co-administered dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium (diclofenac K) with diclofenac K alone on the postoperative pain, swelling and trismus after surgical removal of third molars.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS.\nA prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. A total of 100 patients were randomly allocated to two treatment groups of dexamethasone (prophylactic 8 mg and postoperative 4 mg IV) and diclofenac K (50 mg Oral before and after surgery), and diclofenac K alone (as with first group). The overall analgesic efficacy of the drug combinations was assessed postoperatively by determination of pain intensity using a category rating scale. Facial swelling was measured using a tape measure placed from tragus to gonion to tragus, while interincisal mouth-opening of patients was measured using a vernier calibrated caliper pre-operatively and post-operatively.\n\nRESULTS.\nCo-administration of dexamethasone and diclofenac K was significantly superior to diclofenac alone for the relief of pain (P < 0.05), and facial swelling up to post-operative 48 hour (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference for trismus relief between the two medication protocols (P > 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nThis study illustrates enhanced effects of co-administered dexamethasone and diclofenac K on short-term post-operative pain and swelling, compared to diclofenac potassium alone in third molar surgery.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":1291385,"simplification":"BACKGROUND.\nThis research aims to see if combining two types of medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids, can result in better relief from inflammation and pain after surgery, and with fewer side effects. The study focused on the effects of a steroid (dexamethasone) and an anti-inflammatory (diclofenac potassium) when used together, compared to just using diclofenac potassium alone. The effects were measured on patients undergoing the surgical removal of their third molars, more commonly known as wisdom teeth.\n\nRESEARCH METHODS.\nThis was a study where patients didn't know which treatment they were getting to ensure an unbiased result. It was done at a hospital in Nigeria. One hundred patients who were having their wisdom teeth removed were randomly selected and divided into two groups. One group received both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium, while the other group only received diclofenac potassium. The researchers then measured the overall effectiveness of the medications for relief from pain. They also measured the swelling of the patients' faces and the ability of their mouths to open before and after the operation.\n\nRESULTS.\nUsing both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together was found to provide significantly better relief from pain and facial swelling in the first 48 hours post-surgery compared to using diclofenac potassium alone. However, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the patient's mouth-opening ability.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nAccording to this study, using both dexamethasone and diclofenac potassium together improves short-term relief from post-surgery pain and swelling, compared to using diclofenac potassium alone in patients getting their wisdom teeth removed."},{"title":"Efficacy of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae administered every 4\u20138 weeks in patients with acromegaly previously responsive to lanreotide microparticles 30 mg: a phase III trial","abstract":"OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN.\nDepot somatostatin analogues are well accepted as either adjuvant or primary therapy for acromegaly, and their long dosage intervals facilitate adherence to treatment. Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg, every 4\u20138 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1\u20132 weeks.\n\nPATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.\nPatients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, \u2265 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nNinety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77\u00b77%). Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae than with lanreotide microparticles (3\u00b78 (0\u00b75) vs 4\u00b73 (0\u00b75) ng\/ml; P < 0\u00b7001). GH levels < 2\u00b75 ng\/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH < 2\u00b75 ng\/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide Autogel\u00ae and treatment was well accepted.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4\u20138 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7\u201314 days.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":1618957,"simplification":"GOAL AND PLAN\nThe goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.\nWe asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogel\u00ae every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nNinety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the Autogel\u00ae than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the Autogel\u00ae and patients were happy with the treatment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing lanreotide Autogel\u00ae 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks works just as well and is as well tolerated as using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every one to two weeks in treating acromegaly."},{"title":"Quality of life and metabolic status in mildly depressed women with type 2 diabetes treated with paroxetine: A single-blind randomised placebo controlled trial","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nDepression is prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes and affects both glycemic control and overall quality of life. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the antidepressant paroxetine on metabolic control, quality of life and mental well-being in mildly depressed women with type 2 diabetes.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe randomised 15 mildly depressed women with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes to a 10-week single-blind treatment with either paroxetine 20 mg per day or placebo. Primary efficacy measurements were glycemic control and quality of life. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (GHbA1c) was used as a measure of glycemic control. Quality of life was evaluated using RAND-36. Mental state was assessed using two clinician-rated scoring instruments, Hamilton's Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Montgomery-A\u030asberg's Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and a patient-rated scoring instrument, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI).\n\nRESULTS.\nAt the end of the study no significant difference between groups in improvement of quality of life was found. A trend towards a superior improvement in glycemic control was found in the paroxetine group (p = 0.08). A superior increase in sex-hormone-binding-globuline (SHBG) levels was evidenced in the paroxetine group (p = 0.01) as a sign of improved insulin sensitivity. There was also a trend for superior efficacy of paroxetine in investigator-rated anxiety and depression. This notion was supported by a trend for superior decrease of serum cortisol levels in the paroxetine group (p = 0.06).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nParoxetine has a beneficial effect on measures of insulin sensitivity and may improve glycemic control. Larger studies of longer duration are needed to verify the benefits of paroxetine in type 2 diabetes. While waiting for more conclusive evidence it seems sensible to augment standard care of type 2 diabetes with paroxetine even in patients who do not fulfil routine psychiatric criteria for initiation of antidepressant drug treatment.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":165418,"simplification":"BACKGROUND:\nPeople with type 2 diabetes often also struggle with depression. This depression can make it harder for them to keep their blood sugar levels in check and reduce their quality of life. This study wanted to see if an antidepressant drug called paroxetine could help these people by improving their blood sugar control, quality of life, and mental health.\n\nMETHODS:\nThe study included 15 women with type 2 diabetes who were a little depressed and not succeeding at controlling their blood sugar. These women were randomly picked to take paroxetine or a placebo for 10 weeks. The researchers then checked to see how well their blood sugar was controlled and their quality of life using several techniques including a blood test, a popular health survey, and mental health evaluations.\n\nRESULTS:\nAt the end of the study, there wasn't a big difference in the quality of life improvements between the two groups. However, the group taking paroxetine seemed to have slightly better blood sugar control. They also saw an increase in a protein that indicates improved insulin sensitivity, meaning their bodies could use insulin more effectively. Additionally, the paroxetine group showed signs of reduced anxiety and depression, as well as a decrease in a stress hormone.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nParoxetine might help improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Larger and longer studies are needed to confirm these benefits. But until then, it might make sense to add paroxetine to the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes patients, even if they're not extremely depressed."},{"title":"Buprenorphine versus dihydrocodeine for opiate detoxification in primary care: a randomised controlled trial","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nMany drug users present to primary care requesting detoxification from illicit opiates.

Sixty consenting adults using illicit opiates received either daily sublingual buprenorphine or daily oral dihydrocodeine. Reducing regimens for both interventions were at the discretion of prescribing doctor within a standard regimen of not more than 15 days. Primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opiates at final prescription as indicated by a urine sample. Secondary outcomes during detoxification period and at three and six months post detoxification were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nOnly 23% completed the prescribed course of detoxification medication and gave a urine sample on collection of their final prescription.

We hypothesize that objectively selected employees are 'at risk' for sickness absence and eligible to participate in the intervention program.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe dispatch of 8603 screening instruments forms the starting point of the objective selection process. Different stages of this process, throughout which employees either dropped out or were excluded, were described and compared with the subjective selection process. Characteristics of ineligible and ultimately selected employees, for a randomized trial, were described and quantified using sickness absence data.\n\nRESULTS.\nOverall response rate on the screening instrument was 42.0%. Response bias was found for the parameters sex and age, but not for sickness absence. Sickness absence was higher in the 'at risk' (N = 212) group (42%) compared to the 'not at risk' (N = 2503) group (25%) (OR 2.17 CI 1.63\u20132.89; p = 0.000).

Parasitological and clinical failures and adverse events were compared between the study groups.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS.\nIn a per-protocol analysis, the parasitological and clinical failure rate at day 28 post treatment (PCF28) was lower in the AS+AQ group compared to the AL or AS+CD groups (corrected for re-infections: 6.6% vs 13.8% and 13.8% respectively, p = 0.08; uncorrected: 14.6% vs 27.6% and 28.1% respectively, p = 0.005). In the intention to treat analysis, the rate of early treatment failure was high in all three groups (AS+AQ 13.3%; AL 15.2%; and AS+CD 9.3%, p = 0.2) primarily due to vomiting.

The children were divided into three groups, each receiving one of the drug combinations. They were watched closely by our project staff who delivered the medicines. We checked on them several times after the treatment - 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days later. We were looking for whether the medication failed to get rid of the malaria, and if any child had negative side effects from the medication.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS.\nWhen comparing the results, less children in the AS+AQ group had failed treatments and signs of malaria compared to the other two groups. However, many children in all three groups threw up after taking the medication. It should be noted that the AS+AQ group's treatment failure rate was lower, though not significantly.

We tested this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized, single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the length of postoperative stay in hospital.\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-three patients undergoing high-risk surgery were randomized either to a control group (group C, n = 16) or to an intervention group (group I, n = 17).

One way to achieve this is by using a ventilator to regulate the pressure changes in the blood vessels during these operations. Our research aimed to find out if this method could shorten the length of a patient's stay in the hospital after surgery.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe did a study that involved 33 patients who were due for major surgery. They were divided into two groups. The first group, made up of 16 patients, was treated normally and served as our basis for comparison. In the second group of 17 patients, we kept track of their blood pressure changes using a special monitor during surgery, and ensured that these changes remained small by giving them a lot of fluids.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe two patient groups were similar in their demographic data, overall health condition, type of surgery, and surgery duration. Throughout the surgery, we noticed that the second group received more fluid and experienced a decline in their blood pressure changes. Also, this group generally spent less time in the hospital after surgery (7 days instead of 17). They also had fewer complications, spent less time on ventilators (1 day instead of 5), and stayed in the ICU for a shorter period (3 days instead of 9). \n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur findings suggest that if we carefully monitor and control blood pressure changes by giving plenty of fluids during major surgery, it can improve the recovery outcomes.

Secondary objectives were to review calcium sources and adequacy of intake in black and in white postmenopausal women.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied a convenience sample of 46 black and 139 white postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age 69.4 [5.8] years). Subjects completed a multiple-pass interview for 24-hour recall of foods eaten and the 46-item CFFFQ.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe correlation between measures for total daily calcium intake was moderately strong (r = 0.53, P < .001). The CFFFQ estimated greater total daily calcium intake than did the 24-hour recall (mean [SD], 1,021 [624] mg\/d vs 800 [433] mg\/d, P < .001). As daily calcium intake increased, the 24-hour recall increasingly underreported calcium (r = 0.41, P < .001) compared with the CFFFQ. Cross-tabulation and \u03a72 analyses found that the CFFFQ had greater specificity for lower calcium intakes.

Recent studies have shown that electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) may be an alternative to active exercise in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with myopathy. The aim of our study was to investigate the EMS effects on muscle mass preservation of critically ill patients with the use of ultrasonography (US).\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-nine critically ill patients (age: 59 \u00b1 21 years) with an APACHE II admission score \u226513 were randomly assigned after stratification upon admission to receive daily EMS sessions of both lower extremities (EMS-group) or to the control group (control group). Muscle mass was evaluated with US, by measuring the cross sectional diameter (CSD) of the vastus intermedius and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps muscle.\n\nRESULTS.\nTwenty-six patients were finally evaluated. Right rectus femoris and right vastus intermedius CSD decreased in both groups (EMS group: from 1.42 \u00b1 0.48 to 1.31 \u00b1 0.45 cm, P = 0.001 control group: from 1.59 \u00b1 0.53 to 1.37 \u00b1 0.5 cm, P = 0.002; EMS group: from 0.91 \u00b1 0.39 to 0.81 \u00b1 0.38 cm, P = 0.001 control group: from 1.40 \u00b1 0.64 to 1.11 \u00b1 0.56 cm, P = 0.004, respectively). However, the CSD of the right rectus femoris decreased significantly less in the EMS group (-0.11 \u00b1 0.06 cm, -8 \u00b1 3.9%) as compared to the control group (-0.21 \u00b1 0.10 cm, -13.9 \u00b1 6.4%; P < 0.05) and the CSD of the right vastus intermedius decreased significantly less in the EMS group (-0.10 \u00b1 0.05 cm, -12.5 \u00b1 7.4%) as compared to the control group (-0.29 \u00b1 0.28 cm, -21.5 \u00b1 15.3%; P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEMS is well tolerated and seems to preserve the muscle mass of critically ill patients.

Some studies have suggested that electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), a procedure that uses small electrical currents to make the muscles contract, could be a good substitute for exercise in patients with chronic lung or heart disease who also suffer from muscle weakness. Our study was designed to find out if EMS can help seriously ill patients keep their muscle mass, measured using ultrasound.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied 49 very sick patients, around 59 years old on average, who scored 13 or more on a scale measuring severity of illness. The patients were randomly divided into two groups when they arrived at the hospital: one that received daily EMS treatment on both legs, and a control group that did not receive the treatment. To evaluate the muscle mass, we used ultrasound to measure the thickness of two muscles in the thigh.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn the end, 26 patients were fully evaluated. Both groups lost some muscle mass, but the group treated with EMS lost significantly less muscle mass than the control group. Specifically, the two thigh muscles we measured shrank less in the EMS group than in the control group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nEMS appears to be well received by patients and seems to help very sick patients maintain their muscle mass. This suggests that it could be a useful tool to prevent muscle loss and help with rehabilitation in this patient group. However, we need to do further research to fully understand its potential uses.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThis clinical trial has been registered: NCT00882830."},{"title":"Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus chloroquine to treat vivax malaria in Afghanistan: an open randomized, non-inferiority, trial","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nAfghanistan's national guidelines recommend chloroquine for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection, the parasite responsible for the majority of its malaria burden. Chloroquine resistance in P. vivax is emerging in Asia. Therapeutic responses across Afghanistan have not been evaluated in detail.\n\nMETHODS.\nBetween July 2007 and February 2009, an open-label, randomized controlled trial of chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in patients aged three months and over with slide-confirmed P. vivax mono-infections was conducted. Consistent with current national guidelines, primaquine was not administered. Subjects were followed up daily during the acute phase of illness (days 0-3) and weekly until day 56. The primary endpoint was the overall cumulative parasitological failure rate at day 56 after the start of treatment, with the hypothesis being that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was non-inferior compared to chloroquine (\u0394 = 5% difference in proportion of failures).\n\nRESULTS.\nOf 2,182 individuals with positive blood films for P. vivax, 536 were enrolled in the trial. The day 28 cure rate was 100% in both treatment groups. Parasite clearance was more rapid with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine than chloroquine. At day 56, there were more recurrent infections in the chloroquine arm (8.9%, 95% CI 6.0-13.1%) than the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine arm (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-5.8%), a difference in cumulative recurrence rate of 6.1% (2-sided 90%CI +2.6 to +9.7%). The log-rank test comparing the survival curves confirmed the superiority of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over chloroquine (p = 0.003).

Transient rises in extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine have important signaling roles; and acting through purinergic receptors, can increase blood flow and oxygenation of tissues; and act as neurotransmitters. Increased blood flow not only increases substrate availability but may also aid in recovery through removal of metabolic waste products allowing muscles to accomplish more work with less fatigue.

This is a common procedure that affects both the woman and the health care system. One way to reduce the impact, is to carry out the procedure in an outpatient setting, meaning the patient can go home after the procedure instead of staying at the hospital.

Oral supply of these fatty acids increases their levels in plasma and cell membranes, often at the expense of the omega-6 PUFAs arachidonic acid (ARA) and linoleic acid. This results in an altered pattern of lipid mediator production to one which is less pro-inflammatory. We investigated whether short term intravenous supply of omega-3 PUFAs could change the levels of EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid in plasma and erythrocytes in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases.\n\nMETHODS.\nTwenty patients were randomised to receive a 72 hour infusion of total parenteral nutrition with (treatment group) or without (control group) omega-3 PUFAs. EPA, DHA, ARA and linoleic acid were measured in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) and erythrocytes at several times points up to the end of infusion and 5 to 12 days (mean 9 days) after stopping the infusion.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe treatment group showed increases in plasma PC EPA and DHA and erythrocyte EPA and decreases in plasma PC and erythrocyte linoleic acid, with effects most evident late in the infusion period.

Treating patients in trials incurs additional costs over and above standard of care (SOC), but the extent of the cost burden is not known. We undertook a retrospective cost attribution analysis to quantitate the treatment costs associated with cancer clinical trial protocols conducted over a 2 year period.\n\nMETHODS.\nAll patients entered into oncology (non-haematology) clinical trials involving investigational medicinal products in 2009 and 2010 in a single UK institution were identified. The trial protocols on which they were treated were analysed to identify the treatment costs for the experimental arm(s) of the trial and the equivalent SOC had the patient not been entered in the trial. The treatment cost difference was calculated by subtracting the experimental treatment cost from SOC cost. For randomised trials, an average treatment cost was estimated by taking into account the number of arms and randomisation ratio. An estimate of the annual treatment costs was calculated.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 357 adult oncology patients were treated on 53 different trial protocols: 40 phase III, 2 randomised II\/III and 11 phase II design. A total of 27 trials were academic, non-commercial sponsored trials and 26 were commercial sponsored trials. When compared with SOC, the average treatment cost per patient was an excess of \u00a3431 for a non-commercial trial (range \u00a36393 excess to \u00a36005 saving) and a saving of \u00a39294 for a commercial trial (range \u00a30 to \u00a371 480). There was an overall treatment cost saving of \u00a3388 719 in 2009 and \u00a3496 556 in 2010, largely attributable to pharmaceutical company provision of free drug supplies.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOn an average, non-commercial trial protocols were associated with a small per patient excess treatment cost, whereas commercial trials were associated with a substantially higher cost saving. Taking into account the total number of patients recruited annually, treatment of patients on clinical trial protocols was associated with considerable cost savings across both the non-commercial and commercial portfolio.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":3798949,"simplification":"BACKGROUND\nClinical trials are part of regular medical care.

We compared the cost of the treatments in the trials and the usual treatments the patients could have received. We figured out the difference in cost between these two. For studies that compared treatments, we estimated the average treatment cost. We also estimated the yearly costs.\n\nRESULTS\nDuring those two years, 357 adult cancer patients took part in 53 different research studies. Some of these were designed by universities and other non-profit groups, while others were sponsored by drug companies. On average, the university trials cost an extra \u00a3431 per patient. The drug company trials, on the other hand, saved an average of \u00a39294 per patient. This is largely because these companies supplied the drugs for free. In total, these trials saved about \u00a3885,275 over the two years.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn general, trials designed by universities cost a little more per patient. Drug company trials, though, saved much more money. Given the large number of patients that take part in these trials every year, they can lead to big savings, regardless of who runs them."},{"title":"Vitrification of immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes: effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and warming time on cleavage and embryo development","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nThe present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs).\n\nMETHODS.\nTwo experiments were conducted.

Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild TBI (mTBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: EE housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured.

Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and stiffness index (\u03b2) were remarkably greater (8.388 \u00b1 3.254 m\/s vs. 7.269 \u00b1 1.332 m\/s; 12.51 \u00b1 14.16 vs.9.279 \u00b1 2.871), while compliance coefficient (CC) decreased significantly in the diabetes group (0.802 \u00b1 0.3094 mm2\/Kpa vs. 0.968 \u00b1 0.3992 mm2\/Kpa) (P < 0.05). The displacement difference of radial (RD-D), longitudinal (LD-D) and rotation (ROT-D) directions were significantly different between two groups' comparison (P = 0.0212, P = 0.0235 and P = 0.0072, respectively). The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) and the time of radial peak strain rate (RSR-T) were found to be significantly different between the two groups (341.9 \u00b1 77.56 ms vs. 369.0 \u00b1 78.26 ms, P = 0.0494; 142.7 \u00b1 22.43 ms vs. 136.2 \u00b1 30.70 ms, P = 0.0474). CS-TD and RSR-T were also found to be positively correlated with CC value (r = 0.3908, P < 0.005 and r = 0.3027, P = 0.0326, respectively). Finally, PWV was negatively correlated with CC with (r = \u20130.6177, P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn type 2 diabetes, the functional changes in CCA can be identified using the methods presented in this article earlier than the structural changes. Arterial stiffness values provided by QAS and X-strain analysis can be used as indicators of CCA functional lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":3932017,"simplification":"BACKGROUND.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are more likely to suffer from heart diseases because diabetes can cause the arteries to become stiff. This particular study attempts to study these arterial changes in detail by using two different techniques that use sound waves.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe test involved 91 individuals who were divided into two groups: one with diabetes and one without (the control group). By using a device that transmitted sound waves, we studied changes in the wall of an artery in the neck known as the carotid artery. We then compared the findings of the two groups.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe thickness of the wall of the carotid artery was pretty similar in both groups. However, the speed at which the pulse travelled and the stiffness of the artery were notably higher in the group with diabetes, whereas the artery's flexibility was significantly lower. The differences in how the arteries moved and adjusted were also significant between the two groups. Additionally, the time taken for certain changes to happen in the arteries were significantly different between the two groups. These time measures were also found to be linked positively with the flexibility of the arteries, whereas the pulse speed was linked negatively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, we can identify functional changes in the carotid artery earlier than structural changes by using the methods described in this study. This suggests the degree of stiffness and elasticity of the artery can serve as indicators of functional issues in patients with type 2 diabetes."},{"title":"The Role of Chest Physiotherapy in Prevention of Postextubation Atelectasis in Pediatric Patients with Neuromuscular Diseases","abstract":"OBJECTIVE.\nThere are controversial findings in the literature on the effects of chest physiotherapy on postextubation lung collapse in pediatric age group.

Although several studies have shown positive outcomes in response to spinal flexibility training programs, little is known about the management of sets and repetitions in training protocols. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8-week specific and standardized flexibility training program on the range of spinal motion in elderly women.\n\nMETHODS.\nParticipants were recruited in a senior center of Palermo and randomly assigned in two groups: trained group (TG) and control group (CG), which included 19 and 18 women, respectively. TG was trained for 8 weeks at two sessions\/week. In particular, every session included three phases: warm up (~10 minutes), central period (~50 minutes), and cool down (~10 minutes). CG did not perform any physical activity during the experimental period. Spinal ranges of motion (ROM) were measured from neutral standing position to maximum bending position and from neutral standing position to maximum extension position before and after the experimental period, using a SpinalMouse\u00ae device (Idiag, Volkerswill, Switzerland).\n\nRESULTS.\nAfter the training period, TG showed an increase in spinal inclination by 16.4% (P<0.05), in sacral\/hip ROM by 29.2% (P<0.05), and in thoracic ROM by 22.5% (P>0.05) compared with CG from maximum extension position to maximum bending position.

This study was undertaken to clarify the effects of citrulline on expressions of specific transporters such as ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 and ABCG1, and the cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I or HDL in vitro and ex vivo. Citrulline increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA and protein levels in THP-1 macrophages, translating into enhanced apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. In the human crossover study, 8 healthy male volunteers (age 30\u201349 years) consumed either 3.2 g\/day citrulline or placebo for 1 week. Citrulline consumption brought about significant increases in plasma levels of citrulline and arginine. Supporting the in vitro data, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated under autologous post-citrulline sera demonstrated enhancement of both apoA-I- and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux through increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 expressions, compared to MDM differentiated under pre-citrulline sera. However, the placebo did not modulate these parameters. Therefore, in addition to improving endothelium function, citrulline might have an anti-atherogenic property by increasing RCT of HDL.","sectioned":false,"PMCID":4078065,"simplification":"The process of moving cholesterol from the body's tissues back to the liver, known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), is important for preventing heart disease.

However, we didn't know if citrulline could impact RCT. \n\nIn this study, we investigated if citrulline could influence some transport mechanisms related to RCT, specifically two proteins (ABCA1 and ABCG1) which help in the process. Also, we examined if citrulline had any effect on how well cholesterol is removed from immune cells (called macrophages) by a protein, apolipoprotein A-I, or by HDL (good cholesterol), both in the lab and in the human body. \n\nWe found that adding citrulline did increase the level of the two important proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1, in the macrophages. This led to better removal of cholesterol by apolipoprotein A-I and HDL. \n\nNext, we looked at people's response to citrulline. Eight healthy men, aged 30-49, were given either citrulline or a placebo (a substance with no effect) for a week. After consuming citrulline, their blood levels of citrulline and another amino acid, arginine, went up significantly. Checking their immune cells again, we saw that the cells were now better at releasing cholesterol, thanks to higher levels of those two proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1. No such changes were observed with the placebo.\n\nOur results suggest that, apart from helping blood vessels stay healthy, citrulline could also reduce the risk of heart disease by boosting the RCT process."},{"title":"Effects of Substituting Soybean Meal for Sunflower Cake in the Diet on the Growth and Carcass Traits of Crossbred Boer Goat Kids","abstract":"The present study was conducted to determine the best level of substitution of soybean meal by sunflower cake in diets for kids through the evaluation of quantitative carcass traits.

We sought to assess the preventive effects of a combined regimen of pentoxifylline (PTX), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on focal radiation-induced liver injury (fRILI).\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS.\nPatients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma who were scheduled for local ablation by radiotherapy (image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy) were prospectively randomized to receive PTX, UDCA and LMWH for 8 weeks (treatment) or no medication (control). Focal RILI at follow-up was assessed using functional hepatobiliary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A minimal threshold dose, i.e. the dose to which the outer rim of the fRILI was formerly exposed to, was quantified by merging MRI and dosimetry data.\n\nRESULTS.\nResults from an intended interim-analysis made a premature termination necessary. Twenty-two patients were included in the per-protocol analysis. Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in the study treatment-group compared with the control (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). Qualitative evidence of fRILI by MRI at 6 weeks was observed in 45.5% of patients in the treatment versus 90.9% of the control group. No significant differences between the groups were observed at the 12-week follow-up.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe post-therapeutic application of PTX, UDCA and low-dose LMWH significantly reduced the extent and incidence fRILI at 6 weeks after radiotherapy. The development of subsequent fRILI at 12 weeks (4 weeks after cessation of PTX, UDCA and LMWH during weeks 1\u20138) in the treatment group was comparable to the control group thus supporting the observation that the agents mitigated fRILI.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nEU clinical trials register 2008-002985-70 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01149304","sectioned":true,"PMCID":4231047,"simplification":"BACKGROUND.\nUsing targeted radiation to treat liver cancers can be effective in some patients. However, the liver can only handle a limited amount of radiation before it starts to get damaged. We looked into whether a combination treatment of three drugs - pentoxifylline (PTX), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) - could prevent radiation-induced liver injury.\n\nMETHODS.\nPeople with liver cancer spread from colon cancer who were set for radiation treatment were included. They were randomly chosen to receive either the combination treatment for 8 weeks or no extra medication. We looked for signs of radiation-induced liver injury using a specific type of MRI scan. We also calculated the smallest radiation dose that caused injury by combining MRI results and radiation dose data.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe had to stop the study early due to early results. We included 22 patients in the final report. The smallest dose that caused liver injury 6 weeks after radiation treatment was significantly higher in the group receiving the combination treatment compared to the group without (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). At 6 weeks, 45.5% of the treated group showed signs of liver injury compared with 90.9% of the untreated group. There were no noticeable differences between the groups at 12 weeks.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTaking PTX, UDCA and low-dose LMWH after radiation treatment considerably reduced liver injury at 6 weeks after radiation treatment. However, 4 weeks after stopping the drug combination (which was given during weeks 1-8), incidences of liver injury in the treated group were like those in the control group. This supports the notion that these drugs can minimize radiation-induced liver injury. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe trial was registered in the EU clinical trials register (2008-002985-70) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01149304)."},{"title":"A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Scalable Weight Loss Treatments in Primary Care","abstract":"OBJECTIVE.\nPrimary-care (PC) settings may be an opportune place to deliver obesity interventions.

Caregivers in the experimental group (N = 149) were compared to caregivers who received a minimal intervention consisting of e-bulletins (N = 96). Outcomes were symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS-A). All data were collected via the Internet, and an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.\n\nRESULTS.\nAlmost all caregivers were spouses or children (in-law). They were predominantly female and lived with the care recipient in the same household. Age of the caregivers varied from 26 to 87 years. Level of education varied from primary school to university, with almost half of them holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Regression analyses showed that caregivers in the experimental group showed significantly lower symptoms of depression (p = .034) and anxiety (p = .007) post intervention after adjustment for baseline differences in the primary outcome scores and the functional status of the patients with dementia. Effect sizes were moderate for symptoms of anxiety (.48) and small for depressive symptoms (.26).\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe Internet course 'Mastery over Dementia' offers an effective treatment for family caregivers of people with dementia reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results of this study justify further development of Internet interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia and suggest that such interventions are promising for keeping support for family caregivers accessible and affordable.

This is due to the growing number of people who have dementia and the negative effects on the mental health of the family members who care for them.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe ran a study to see if an online program called 'Mastery over Dementia' could help. We had 251 caregivers participate, but 6 dropped out right at the beginning. The caregivers were randomly split into two groups. One group (149 people) used the online program and we compared them to the second group (96 people) who only received informational emails. We wanted to see if there was a change in signs of depression and anxiety. The caregivers answered all our questions through the internet and we made sure to include everyone's data in the final analysis.\n\nRESULTS:\nMost of the caregivers were husbands, wives, or children of the person with dementia. Most of them were women who lived in the same house as the person they were caring for. Their ages ranged from 26 to 87 and their education background varied greatly, with about half having at least a college degree. We discovered that the caregivers who used the online program had noticeably less signs of depression and anxiety after using the program.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur study shows that the 'Mastery over Dementia' online program can be a useful tool for family caregivers of people with dementia since it reduces signs of depression and anxiety. This suggests that developing more online resources like this could be beneficial for family caregivers, making support more accessible and financially manageable. This is promising for the future generations of caregivers who will likely be familiar with using the internet.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nYou can find more details about this study in the Dutch Trial Register under the code NTR-2051."},{"title":"Increased functional connectivity in the resting-state basal ganglia network after acute heroin substitution","abstract":"Reinforcement signals in the striatum are known to be crucial for mediating the subjective rewarding effects of acute drug intake. It is proposed that these effects may be more involved in early phases of drug addiction, whereas negative reinforcement effects may occur more in later stages of the illness. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore whether acute heroin substitution also induced positive reinforcement effects in striatal brain regions of protracted heroin-maintained patients. Using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach, we compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) strengths within the basal ganglia\/limbic network across a group of heroin-dependent patients receiving both an acute infusion of heroin and placebo and 20 healthy subjects who received placebo only. Subsequent correlation analyses were performed to test whether the rsFC strength under heroin exposure correlated with the subjective rewarding effect and with plasma concentrations of heroin and its main metabolites morphine. Relative to the placebo treatment in patients, heroin significantly increased rsFC of the left putamen within the basal ganglia\/limbic network, the extent of which correlated positively with patients' feelings of rush and with the plasma level of morphine. Furthermore, healthy controls revealed increased rsFC of the posterior cingulate cortex\/precuneus in this network relative to the placebo treatment in patients. Our results indicate that acute heroin substitution induces a subjective rewarding effect via increased striatal connectivity in heroin-dependent patients, suggesting that positive reinforcement effects in the striatum still occur after protracted maintenance therapy.","sectioned":false,"PMCID":4354356,"simplification":"This study looked into how heroin use affects the brain, specifically the striatal brain regions. It's known that when someone first starts using drugs, a part of the brain known as the striatum assists in creating a feeling of reward.

They compared the brain activity of these patients when they took heroin and when they took a placebo, to a group of healthy individuals who only took a placebo. \n\nThey found that heroin increased the connectivity in a part of the brain called the left putamen, which led the patients to feel a \"rush\". This feeling was positively linked to the level of morphine (derived from heroin) in their blood. However, in healthy individuals, a different part of the brain became more active compared to the patients when they took placebo.\n\nIn conclusion, their findings suggest that the feeling of reward after using heroin still occurs in long-term users, because of increased connectivity in certain parts of the brain."},{"title":"Randomized Comparison of Selective Internal Radiotherapy (SIRT) Versus Drug-Eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma","abstract":"PURPOSE.\nTo prospectively compare SIRT and DEB-TACE for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\nMETHODS.\nFrom 04\/2010\u201307\/2012, 24 patients with histologically proven unresectable N0, M0 HCCs were randomized 1:1 to receive SIRT or DEB-TACE. SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6 weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment. Patients were followed-up by MRI every 3 months; the final evaluation was 05\/2013.\n\nRESULTS.\nBoth groups were comparable in demographics (SIRT: 8males\/4females, mean age 72 \u00b1 7 years; TACE: 10males\/2females, mean age 71 \u00b1 9 years), initial tumor load (1 patient \u226525 % in each group), and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage (SIRT: 12\u00d7B; TACE 1\u00d7A, 11\u00d7B).

Previous studies indicated that using earplugs and eye masks can improve REM sleep in healthy subjects in simulated ICU environment, and improve sleep quality in ICU patients. This study aimed to determine the effects of using earplugs and eye masks with relaxing background music on sleep, melatonin and cortisol levels in ICU patients.\n\nMETHODS.\nFifty patients who underwent a scheduled cardiac surgery and were expected to stay at least 2 nights in Cardiac Surgical ICU (CSICU) were included. They were randomized to sleep with or without earplugs and eye masks combined with 30-minute relaxing music during the postoperative nights in CSICU. Urine was analyzed for nocturnal melatonin and cortisol levels. Subjective sleep quality was evaluated using the Chinese version of Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (a visual analog scale, ranging 0\u2013100).\n\nRESULTS.\nData from 45 patients (20 in intervention group, 25 in control group) were analyzed. Significant differences were found between groups in depth of sleep, falling asleep, awakenings, falling asleep again after awakening and overall sleep quality (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Perceived sleep quality was better in the intervention group. No group differences were found in urinary melatonin levels and cortisol levels for the night before surgery, and the first and second nights post-surgery (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The urinary melatonin levels of the first and second postoperative nights were significantly lower than those of the night before surgery (P\u2009=\u20090.01).

Half of these patients were given pure oxygen for 3 hours while the other half simply breathed in normal room air. We performed scans on their brains just after the surgery and 24 hours afterwards. Without knowing who had received the oxygen treatment, we assessed the change in air volume in their brains and the air absorption rate 24 hours after the surgery. Our findings suggest that the air build-up reduced more in the patients who received the oxygen treatment. This effect was especially pronounced in patients who were above 52 years old. However, there was no significant difference in attention levels (measured by a test) between the two groups. The alertness level differed between the two groups, with the oxygen-treated patients had increased alertness.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe oxygen treatment administered through a tube after brain surgery is safe and effective in reducing air build-up in the brain.

If cervical ripening using a prostaglandin is required, a pre-labour overnight hospitalisation and separation from family and support companions is necessary. Recent evidence shows that balloon catheter cervical ripening is just as effective as prostaglandins, but does not cause uterine stimulation. For women with low risk pregnancies, this offers the possibility of undergoing the overnight ripening process in their own home. We conducted a pilot randomised trial to assess the outcomes, clinical pathways and acceptability to both women and clinicians of outpatient balloon catheter ripening compared with usual inpatient care.\n\nMETHODS.\nForty-eight women with low risk term pregnancies were randomised (2:1) to either outpatient (n = 33) or inpatient double-balloon catheter (n = 15) cervical ripening. Although not powered for statistically significant differences, the study explored potential direction of effect for key clinical outcomes such as oxytocin use, caesarean section and morbidities. Feedback on acceptability was sought from women at catheter insertion and 4 weeks after the birth, and from midwives and doctors, at the end of the study.\n\nRESULTS.\nClinical and perinatal outcomes were similar. Most women required oxytocin (77 %). The outpatient group were 24 % less likely to require oxytocin (risk difference \u221223.6 %, 95 % CI \u221243.8 to \u22123.5). There were no failed inductions, infections or uterine hyperstimulation attributable to the catheter in either group. Most women in both groups reported discomfort with insertion and wearing the catheter, but were equally satisfied with their care and felt the baby was safe (91 % both groups). Outpatient women reported feeling less isolated or emotionally alone. Most midwives and doctors (n = 90) agreed that they are more comfortable in sending home a woman with a catheter than prostaglandins and 90 % supported offering outpatient ripening to eligible women.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOutpatient balloon catheter ripening should be further investigated as an option for women in an adequately powered randomised trial.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nProspectively registered, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612001184864.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":4450858,"simplification":"BACKGROUND.\nIn Australia, one out of four births are induced, or started artificially. Usually, this requires a woman to stay in a hospital overnight for a procedure involving a hormone called prostaglandin. However, new studies show that a balloon catheter, a tube with an inflatable section, can also be used for something called cervical ripening and is just as effective as prostaglandins. The bonus is that it doesn't cause stimulation of the womb. For low-risk pregnancies, this method allows women to have the procedure at home. We conducted an initial small-scale study to compare this at-home method with the usual in-hospital procedure in terms of results, how it's done, and how acceptable it is to both women and clinicians.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe had 48 women with low-risk pregnancies take part in the study. Two thirds of them tried the at-home method while one third stayed in the hospital. We looked at a few key things, like whether labor-inducing drugs were needed, if a C-section was performed, and any health problems. We also got feedback on how acceptable this procedure was both from women and healthcare professionals.\n\nRESULTS.\nOutcomes for mother and baby were similar in both groups. Most women, 77%, needed labor-inducing drugs. However, the group at home was 24% less likely to need these drugs.

The serum levels of CagA, interleukin (IL)-10, E-selectin, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups, as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B, were matched and comparable.

Knowing that resistance exercise (RT) can enhance MPS, we examined whether RT could enhance MPS following 2 weeks of SR. In addition, as we postulated that SR may impair feeding-induced vasodilation limiting nutrient delivery to muscle, we also examined whether citrulline (CIT), as an arginine and nitric oxide precursor, could attenuate muscle anabolic resistance accompanying SR. We used a unilateral leg model to compare older subjects' who had undergone SR to a loaded condition of SR plus RT (SR + RT). Thirty older men (70 \u00b1 1 years) underwent 14 days of SR (<1500 steps\/day) with supplementation of either 5 g\/day CIT or glycine placebo.

Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) for sustained virological response (SVR), we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon\/ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS.\nTreatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon \u03b1-2a (180 \u03bcg\/week) and ribavirin (800\u20131,200 mg, according to weight) for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved an RVR, which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 (<50 IU), were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment (24- and 48-week treatment groups, respectively). The primary outcome measure was SVR. From January 2011 to June 2014, 152(152\/210, 72.4%) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group.

We examined engagement generated by content based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) in a motivationally tailored smoking cessation intervention on Facebook.\n\nOBJECTIVE.\nThis study aimed to identify which intervention content based on the TTM (Decisional Balance and 10 processes of change) generated the highest engagement among participants in pre-action stages of change (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation).\n\nMETHODS.\nParticipants (N=79, 20% female, mean age 20.8) were assessed for readiness to quit smoking and assigned to one of 7 secret Facebook groups tailored to their stage of change. Daily postings to the groups based on TTM Decisional Balance and the 10 processes of change were made by research staff over 3 months. Engagement was operationalized as the number of participant comments to each post. TTM content-based predictors of number of comments were analyzed and stratified by baseline stage of change, using negative binomial regression analyses with and without zero inflation.\n\nRESULTS.\nA total of 512 TTM-based posts generated 630 individual comments. In Precontemplation and Contemplation groups, Decisional Balance posts generated above average engagement (P=.01 and P<.001). In Contemplation groups, posts based on the TTM processes Dramatic Relief and Self-Liberation resulted in below average engagement (P=.01 and P=.005). In Preparation groups, posts based on Consciousness Raising generated above average engagement (P=.009). Participant engagement decreased over time and differed between groups within Precontemplation and Contemplation stages, but was independent of day of the week and time of day the content was posted to the groups. No participant baseline characteristics significantly predicted engagement.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParticipants not ready to quit in the next 30 days (in Precontemplation or Contemplation) engaged most when prompted to think about the pros and cons of behavior change, while those in the Preparation stage engaged most when posts increased awareness about smoking and smoking cessation.

They were assessed to find out how ready they were to quit smoking, then put into one of 7 private Facebook groups. These groups were tailored to their readiness to quit. A member of the research team would post daily content matching their readiness level for three months. We measured the success of the posts by how many comments they got.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe 512 posts got a total of 630 comments. For those who weren't planning on quitting within the month, posts asking them to weigh the pros and cons of changing their behavior got the most comments. For people who were getting ready to quit, posts raising awareness about smoking issues got the most comments. No matter what time or day the posts were published, the engagement levels dropped over time and varied between the different groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nParticipants who weren't planning to quit anytime soon engaged the most with posts asking them to think about the good and bad sides of changing their behavior. Those getting ready to quit liked posts about facts related to smoking and how to quit. This supports the idea of using material based on how ready someone is to quit smoking.

Our study aims to investigate the effect of controlled limited formula usage during birth hospitalisation on breastfeeding, using the primary hypothesis that early limited formula feeds in infants with early weight loss will not adversely affect the rate of exclusive or any breastfeeding as measured at discharge, 3 and 6 months of age.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS.\nWe randomly assigned 104 healthy term infants, 24 to 48 hours old, with \u2265 5% loss of birth weight to controlled limited formula (CLF) intervention (10 ml formula by syringe after each breastfeeding, discontinued at onset of lactation) or control group (standard approach, SA). Groups were compared for demographic data and breastfeeding rates at discharge, 3 months and 6 months of age (p-values adjusted for multiple testing).\n\nRESULTS.\nFifty newborns were analysed in CLF and 50 in SA group. There were no differences in demographic data or clinical characteristics between groups. We found no evidence of difference between treatment groups in the rates of exclusive as well as any breastfeeding at discharge (p-value 0.2 and >0.99 respectively), 3 months (p-value 0.12 and 0.10) and 6 months of infants\u2019 age (p-value 0.45 and 0.34 respectively).

We tested the effects of OSS on workload and 12 facility performance indicators for emergency triage assessment and treatment, HIV testing, and malaria and pneumonia case management among outpatients by two subgroups: 1) mid-level practitioners (MLP) who attended IMID training (IMID-MLP) and 2) health workers who did not (No-IMID).\n\nMETHODS.\nThirty-six health facilities participated in the IDCAP trial, with 18 randomly assigned to Arm A and 18 to Arm B. Two MLP in both arms received IMID. All providers at Arm A facilities received nine monthly OSS visits from April to December 2010 while Arm B did not. From November 2009 to December 2010, 777,667 outpatient visits occurred. We analyzed 669,580 (86.1 %) outpatient visits, where provider cadre was reported. Treatment was provided by 64 IMID-MLP and 1,515 No-IMID providers. The effect of OSS was measured by the difference in pre\/post changes across arms after controlling for covariates (adjusted ratio of relative risks = a RRR).\n\nRESULTS.\nThe effect of OSS on patients-per-provider-per-day (workload) among IMID-MLP (aRRR = 1.21; p = 0.48) and No-IMID (aRRR = 0.90; p = 0.44) was not statistically significant. Among IMID-MLP, OSS was effective for three indicators: malaria cases receiving an appropriate antimalarial (aRRR = 1.26, 99 % CI = 1.02-1.56), patients with negative malaria test result prescribed an antimalarial (aRRR = 0.49, 99 % CI = 0.26-0.92), and patients with acid-fast bacilli smear negative result receiving empiric treatment for acute respiratory infection (aRRR = 2.04, 99 % CI = 1.06-3.94). Among No-IMID, OSS was effective for two indicators: emergency and priority patients admitted, detained or referred (aRRR = 2.12, 99 % CI = 1.05-4.28) and emergency patients receiving at least one appropriate treatment (aRRR = 1.98, 99 % CI = 1.21-3.24).\n\nCONCLUSION.\nEffects of OSS on workload were not statistically significant. Significant OSS effects on facility performance across subgroups were heterogeneous. OSS supported MLP who diagnosed and treated patients to apply IMID knowledge.

This evidence on OSS effectiveness could inform interventions to improve health workers' capacity to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article 10.1186\/s12889-016-3375-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":4972969,"simplification":"BACKGROUND.\nThis study was about how we can improve how health workers diagnose and treat infectious diseases. We tried two different methods: a special classroom training that covered all aspects of managing infectious diseases, and on-the-job, hands-on guidance. The aim was to see if the hands-on guidance, or On-Site Support (OSS), made a difference in how health workers handled emergency cases, HIV testing, and treatment of malaria and pneumonia patients. Specifically, we wanted to compare how health workers who had gone through the classroom training performed against those who hadn't.\n\nMETHODS.\n36 health facilities took part in the study, split evenly into two groups. Two health workers from each group were chosen to go through the special classroom training. Everyone in one group got hands-on guidance for nine months, while the other group did not. We analyzed almost a year's worth of outpatient visits (over 669,000) in which the care provider was mentioned, to see what effect the hands-on guidance had.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found that having on-site guidance didn't significantly change the number of patients a health worker saw each day. But for health workers who had been through the classroom training, the guidance helped in three areas: treating malaria correctly, not prescribing antimalarial drugs if a test was negative, and treating respiratory infections in people who tested negative for tuberculosis. For health workers who hadn't been through the special classroom training, the guidance was helpful in managing emergency patients better.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nWhile on-site guidance didn't change how many patients a healthcare worker saw, it did show positive effects on how they managed patients, especially in emergency situations. This sort of hands-on guidance seems to help health workers use their training better, and improve care. These findings could help improve interventions to improve the capacity of health workers to deliver better quality infectious diseases care.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nThere is more material related to this study available online for those with proper authorization."},{"title":"Hickman catheter and implantable port devices for the delivery of chemotherapy: a phase II randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nIn the United Kingdom, totally implantable venous access systems (TIVAS) are not routinely used.

LS and SNP combination was administered in 35 patients (study group, SG). In the remaining patients, normal saline solution was given (placebo group, PG). Levosimendan (10\u03bcgr\/kg) started 4 h prior to operation and we stopped LS before the initiation of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). During the rewarming period, we started again levosimendan (10\u03bcgr\/kg) in combination with SNP (0.1-0.2 \u03bcgr\/kg\/min). If mean blood pressure decreased by more than 25% compared with pre-infusion values, for corrected of mean arterial pressure, the volume loading was performed using a 500 ml ringer lactate. Hemodynamic variables, inotrophyc requirement, and laboratory values were recorded.\n\nRESULTS.\nFive patients died (7.14%) post-surgery (one from SG and 4 from PG) due to low cardiac out-put syndrome (LOS).

We gave half the patients the drug combination and the other half a harmless salt solution (as a comparison group). The levosimendan was started 4 hours before surgery and stopped before the start of the heart bypass; during the last part of surgery, levosimendan was restarted along with SNP. If a patient's blood pressure dropped significantly during this process, a volume increasing solution was given to correct it. We recorded many patients' blood measurements, their need for heart-strengthening drugs, and laboratory test results.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND:\nAfter surgery, 5 patients died due to heart complications (one from the drug group and four from the comparison group). Patients given the drugs had stronger heart function stats compared to those who weren't. These patients also needed less supportive drugs and less interventional equipment post-surgery. Various measurements like cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac index were better in the drug group. Also, fewer people in the drug group needed help from heart-strengthening drugs or equipment post-surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe study shows that the LS and SNP combination really improved heart function during and after surgery. Using these drugs led to less need for other supporting drugs or equipment. Thus, we suggest using this drug combination before and during surgery."},{"title":"Effects of a balance-based exergaming intervention using the Kinect sensor on posture stability in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nThe present study examined the effects of a balance-based exergaming intervention using the Kinect sensor on postural stability and balance in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).\n\nMETHODS.\nWe conducted a subject-blinded, randomized controlled study.

Participants in the training group were divided over four groups and practiced during a 2-week-period either direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination of these tasks. Deformable objects with different compliances had to be manipulated while kinematic variables and grip force control were assessed. Functional performance was measured with the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) prior to and after the training sessions, and after 2 weeks and 3 months retention. The control group only performed the SHAP tests.\n\nRESULTS.\nAll four training groups and the control group improved on the SHAP, also after a period of non-use. Type of training had a small but significant influence on the improvements of the SHAP score. On a kinematic level movement times decreased and hook closing velocities increased over time. The indirect grasping group showed significantly shorter plateau times than the other training groups. Grip force control only improved a little over training.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nTraining action-perception couplings of body-powered prosthesis in basic tasks transferred to functional tasks and this lasted after a period of non-use. During training movement times decreased and the indirect grasping group showed advantages. It is advisable to start body-powered training with indirect grasping tasks but also to practice hook-object orientations.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186\/s12984-016-0197-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":5054596,"simplification":"Background:\nThis study looked at how people learn to use a body-powered prosthetic device. These devices are controlled by a harness and cable, and provide limited feedback to the user about limb position. The aim was to understand how practicing basic tasks could be applied to real-world tasks, and how this learning changes over time in new users of such prosthetics.\n\nMethods:\nThe study involved 30 regular people and 17 controls; all of them used a simulated prosthetic device for the study. Those in the training group were split into four sub-groups and practiced either direct grasping, indirect grasping, fixation, or a combination for two weeks. They had to manipulate soft objects of different hardness while researchers measured their movement and grip strength. Performance was measured before and after the training sessions, and then again after two weeks and three months of no practice. The control group only did the performance tests.\n\nResults:\nAll four training groups and the control group improved on the performance tests, even after they stopped using the device. The type of training did slightly affect how much they improved. Overall, they became faster with their movements and increased the speed at which they closed the device's hook over time. The group that practiced indirect grasping improved faster than the other groups. Grip strength didn't improve much with training.\n\nConclusions:\nPracticing basic tasks with a body-powered prosthetic device can help users get better at real-world tasks, even after they've stopped practicing. Users got faster and the group that practiced indirect grasping progressed faster. It's recommended that new users of such devices start practicing with indirect grasping tasks and also practice different ways to orient the hook.\n\nElectronic Supplementary Material:\nMore information related to the study is available online for those who are authorized to view it."},{"title":"The timing of administration of intravenous dexmedetomidine during lower limb surgery: a randomized controlled trial","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nDexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2 agonist, has sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects without respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine can cause a biphasic cardiovascular response, and induce transient hypertension. Hypotension is a common complication of spinal anesthesia. Decreasing anxiety of patients before procedure is important for high quality of procedure. This study aimed to compare the incidence of hypotension and patients' anxiety and comfort levels when dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered before and after spinal anesthesia.\n\nMETHODS.\nSeventy-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II were randomly allocated into two groups. Spinal anesthesia was performed using 12 mg of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine. In Group A, 1 \u03bcg\/kg of dexmedetomidine was intravenously administered for 10 min, followed by the maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2 \u03bcg\/kg\/hr after 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Patients in Group B received same dose of dexmedetomidine by intravenous administration before 5 min of intrathecal bupivacaine injection. Perioperative vital signs, anxiety (using the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and comfort (using the numerical rating scale) were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in Group A (16.1%) than in Group B (48.4%) during infusion of dexmedetomidine (p = 0.01).

They didn't see any differences in heart rate, blood pressure, or overall life satisfaction related to urinary symptoms across the three groups.\n\nHowever, they found two key differences among the groups. The patients who inhaled linalyl acetate reported less pain and less discomfort from remnants of the bladder tube than the other groups. \n\nIn simple words, the study suggests that inhaling linalyl acetate can help manage pain and discomfort related to bladder tube removal after colorectal cancer surgery."},{"title":"Effect of Islam-based religious program on spiritual wellbeing in elderly with hypertension","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nLack of spiritual health in patients with hypertension leads to many mental, social, and physical effects, On the other hand, considering the prevalence of hypertension among the elderly, interventions to enhance their spiritual wellbeing is essential.

Most were women, white, and with normal brain function. On average, they were around 78 years old. At the start of the study, half of them were taking two or more anticholinergic drugs. After the study,  the group that received extra care saw improved medication appropriateness and reduced their use of anticholinergic drugs. \n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results suggest that the additional support from a doctor and pharmacist team can help older adults reduce their use of potentially harmful medications. This finding is an important step toward helping older adults take only the medications that benefit them the most. \n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION.\nThe study has been legally registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. \n\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL.\nMore information about this study can be found online if you're authorized to access it."},{"title":"A randomized phase","abstract":"Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.

So, there's been a lot of focus on how to manage this pain. One method is known as a paravertebral block (PVB), which has been shown to help with pain from other types of surgeries, like thoracotomy and mastectomy. But we don't know as much about how PVB can reduce pain after gallbladder removal. Our goal here was to see if a one-time PVB injection could lessen the intensity of pain, reduce the need for strong pain medications (opioids), and extend the time before a patient needed more pain relief.\n\nMETHODS.\nWe studied 50 people who had their gallbladders removed in an open surgery. They were split into two groups: one group received the PVB, the other did not (they were our control group). We then looked at how bad their pain was, how much opioid medication they needed, and how long it took before they asked for more pain relief in the first 24 hours following surgery.\n\nRESULTS.\nWe found some promising results! The PVB group reported less pain 24 hours after their surgery than the control group did. They took less opioid medication and waited longer before asking for more pain relief.

All patients received primary surgical resection of their malignancy. Patients were risk-stratified by adverse features, and overall survival rates were determined. Patients were considered high risk if they had extracapsular extension and\/or positive margin after resection. Patients were considered intermediate risk if they did not meet the criteria for high risk but had pT3-T4 disease, pN+ disease, lymphovascular space invasion, adenoid cystic histology, or grade 2-3 disease. Patients who did not meet criteria for high or intermediate risk were considered low risk.

Patients with UC and a serum 25(OH)D level <30\u00a0ng\/ml were eligible for the study. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive either 2,000 IU or 4,000 IU of oral vitamin D3 daily for a total of 90 days. The Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) for quality of life, the Partial Mayo Score for UC disease activity and serum lab tests were compared between the two treatment groups. Matched pair t-tests were computed to assess differences between the vitamin D levels, CRP, UC disease activity and SIBDQ scores before and after vitamin D3 therapy using SPSS version 21.\n\nRESULTS.\nEight UC patients received 2,000 IU\/daily and ten UC patients received 4,000 IU\/daily of vitamin D3 for 90 days. Vitamin D levels increased after 90 days of oral vitamin D3 in both dose groups. However, the increase in vitamin D levels after 90 days of oral vitamin D3, in the 4,000 IU group was significantly higher 16.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.15 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to the 2,000 IU group of vitamin D 5.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.12 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Normal vitamin D levels (>30 ng\/dl) were achieved in four out of the ten UC patients (40%) in the 4,000 IU group and in one out of the eight UC patients (12%) in the 2,000 IU group. In the group receiving 4,000 IU\/day of vitamin D3 the increase in quality life scores (SIBDQ) was significant 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) but not in the 2,000 IU vitamin D3 group 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.87).

The aim of this study was to establish a standard chemoradiotherapy treatment regimen in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS.\nThe CONVERT trial was an open-label, phase 3, randomised superiority trial. We enrolled adult patients (aged \u226518 years) who had cytologically or histologically confirmed limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0\u20132, and adequate pulmonary function. Patients were recruited from 73 centres in eight countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 45 Gy radiotherapy in 30 twice-daily fractions of 1\u00b75 Gy over 19 days, or 66 Gy in 33 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy over 45 days, starting on day 22 after commencing cisplatin\u2013etoposide chemotherapy (given as four to six cycles every 3 weeks in both groups). The allocation method used was minimisation with a random element, stratified by institution, planned number of chemotherapy cycles, and performance status. Treatment group assignments were not masked. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time from randomisation until death from any cause, analysed by modified intention-to-treat. A 12% higher overall survival at 2 years in the once-daily group versus the twice-daily group was considered to be clinically significant to show superiority of the once-daily regimen. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00433563) and is currently in follow-up.\n\nFINDINGS.\nBetween April 7, 2008, and Nov 29, 2013, 547 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive twice-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (274 patients) or once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy (273 patients). Four patients (one in the twice-daily group and three in the once-daily group) did not return their case report forms and were lost to follow-up; these patients were not included in our analyses. At a median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 35\u201358), median overall survival was 30 months (95% CI 24\u201334) in the twice-daily group versus 25 months (21\u201331) in the once-daily group (hazard ratio for death in the once daily group 1\u00b718 [95% CI 0\u00b795\u20131\u00b745]; p=0\u00b714). 2-year overall survival was 56% (95% CI 50\u201362) in the twice-daily group and 51% (45\u201357) in the once-daily group (absolute difference between the treatment groups 5\u00b73% [95% CI \u22123\u00b72% to 13\u00b77%]). The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse event in patients evaluated for chemotherapy toxicity was neutropenia (197 [74%] of 266 patients in the twice-daily group vs 170 [65%] of 263 in the once-daily group). Most toxicities were similar between the groups, except there was significantly more grade 4 neutropenia with twice-daily radiotherapy (129 [49%] vs 101 [38%]; p=0\u00b705). In patients assessed for radiotherapy toxicity, was no difference in grade 3\u20134 oesophagitis between the groups (47 [19%] of 254 patients in the twice-daily group vs 47 [19%] of 246 in the once-daily group; p=0\u00b785) and grade 3\u20134 radiation pneumonitis (4 [3%] of 254 vs 4 [2%] of 246; p=0\u00b770). 11 patients died from treatment-related causes (three in the twice-daily group and eight in the once-daily group).\n\nINTERPRETATION.\nSurvival outcomes did not differ between twice-daily and once-daily concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, and toxicity was similar and lower than expected with both regimens.

The order of the fourth explorations was randomly assigned. During these explorations, we measured blood glucose every 15 min for 4 h and compared the mean and glycemic fluctuations for each test. A resting ECG was performed before and after quinine infusion in each participant.\n\nRESULTS.\nThe mean glycemic level during the 4-h infusion was 83 \u00b1 5 mg\/dl without quinine versus 74 \u00b1 5 \u200b\u200bmg\/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) using saline solute versus 92 \u00b1 7 mg\/dl without quinine versus 82 \u00b1 5 mg\/dl with quinine (p < 0.001) when associated with the glucose solute.

We then took 75 pre-molar teeth and split them into a control group and four test groups. The groups were divided based on the fizziness of the water and whether or not it contained calcium. The first group was not exposed to anything, the second had its enamel etched (like being scratched), and the third was sealed.

Group 1 consisted of 14 listeners (number of females\u2009=\u200911) who were 41\u201361 years old [mean\u2009=\u200953.18; standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u20095.97].

The first group, made up of 14 people mostly women (11 out of 14), were aged between 41 and 61 years. The second group had 15 people, only nine women, aged between 63 and 81. We asked these people to do a few tests from the Woodcock\u2013Johnson III. This is an assessment tool we typically use to evaluate how the brain processes information. Then our volunteers had to do two tasks at the same time. These tasks were a bit different for each round, but the idea was always the same: listen to something while also watching something.\n\nRESULTS.\nLooking at the results, it became clear that the difficulty of the task influences how well people did in terms of hearing accurately, seeing accurately, and how quickly they processed information. Additionally, the certain thinking-related subtests from the taken test could potentially help predict how well people performed in complex tests.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nIt turns out that the more difficult the task, the harder it can be for anyone, regardless of their age, to listen and do another task at the same time.

Between April 2014 and January 2015, sixty-nine patients with 74 HCCs were randomly treated with RFA using either internally cooled-wet (ICW) electrodes in SB mode (SB-RFA, n = 36) or SC electrodes in SM mode (SM-RFA, n = 38). Technical parameters including the number of ablations, ablation time, volume, energy delivery, and complications were evaluated. Thereafter, 1-year and 2-year local tumor progression (LTP) free survival rates were compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\nRESULTS.\nIn the SB-RFA group, less number of ablations were required (1.72\u00b10.70 vs. 2.31\u00b11.37, P = 0.039), the ablation time was shorter (10.9\u00b13.9 vs.14.3\u00b15.0 min, p = 0.004), and energy delivery was smaller (13.1\u00b16.3 vs.23.4\u00b112.8 kcal, p<0.001) compared to SM-RFA.

Despite reports of stigma by sexual violence survivors, limited evidence exists on effective strategies to reduce stigma, particularly in conflict-affected settings. We sought to assess the effect of group Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) on stigma and the extent to which stigma might moderate the effectiveness of CPT in treating mental health problems among survivors of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMETHODS.\nData were drawn from 405 adult female survivors of sexual violence reporting mental distress and poor functioning in North and South Kivu. Women were recruited through organizations providing psychosocial support and then cluster randomized to group CPT or individual support. Women were assessed at baseline, the end of treatment, and again six months later. Assessors were masked to women's treatment assignment. Linear mixed-effect regression models were used to estimate (1) the effect of CPT on feelings of perceived and internalized (felt) stigma, and (2) whether felt stigma and discrimination (enacted stigma) moderated the effects of CPT on combined depression and anxiety symptoms, posttraumatic stress, and functional impairment.\n\nRESULTS.\nParticipants receiving CPT experienced moderate reductions in felt stigma relative to those in individual support (Cohen's D = 0.44, p = value = 0.02) following the end of treatment, though this difference was no longer significant six-months later (Cohen's D = 0.45, p = value = 0.12).

Patients were randomized into three groups. Patients were premedicated intravenously with normal saline in group 1, 50 \u00b5g fentanyl in group 2, and 0.5 mg\/kg ketamine in group 3. All patients received intravenous propofol for sedation. Propofol consumption in mg\/kg\/h was noted. The incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, desaturation, and coughing was noted. The time to achieve a Post Anesthesia Discharge Score (PADS) of 10 was also noted.\n\nRESULTS.\nThere were 68 patients in group 1, 70 in group 2, and 72 in group 3. The amount of propofol consumed was significantly higher in group 1 (9.25 [7.3\u201313.2]) than in group 2 (8.8 [6.8\u201312.2]) and group 3 (7.6 [5.7\u20139.8]).

The most effective diabetes prevention method in prediabetic adults is lifestyle modification. However, despite the benefits of lifestyle change, diabetes prevalence continues to increase. Maintaining a regular exercise routine and a healthy eating plan may be difficult because of the negative emotional barriers (i.e., stress, mood) that a prediabetic individual faces. This is particularly evident in older individuals when you combine that with decreases in mobility and geriatric syndromes. A potential treatment for these emotional barriers is a natural supplement called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). In the current study, the group included 154 participants, both men and women, ranging between the ages of 41 to 71 years old. The study design was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group study. The Psychosocial Depressive Symptoms Questionnaire (PDS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to examine the effect of two doses of 5-ALA (15 mg and 50 mg) on various components of mood (i.e., hopefulness, loneliness, and motivation) and coping ability. Using SAS software, an ordered logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between the dose groups (control, 15 mg, and 50 mg) and the responses to the two questionnaires, the PDS and PSS, used in this study. An integrative literature review, using the PubMed database, searched for studies on the relationship between 5-ALA administration and mood and coping ability. Our literature review resulted in zero published articles. Next, we found that the intake of 5-ALA was significantly associated with improved coping ability (p = 0.004) and improved self-perception of effort spent (p = 0.002). Finally, we found a significant dose-dependent relationship for the association of 5-ALA intake on measures of effort (p = 0.003), loneliness (p = 0.006), and coping ability (p = 0.003). The 50 mg dose was more effective than the 15 mg dose in improving these measures. In conclusion, after 12 weeks of taking 5-ALA, we found significant improvements in self-perception of effort spent, loneliness, and coping ability in prediabetic middle age and older adults. Improved mood and coping ability may allow prediabetic individuals to overcome the emotional obstacles preventing them from maintaining a healthy lifestyle and ultimately, help them to avoid the development of diabetes.","sectioned":false,"PMCID":5976501,"simplification":"In 2010, around 79 million Americans, over half of whom were over 65, had a condition called prediabetes.

However, the laser showed better results as it caused less pain, less bleeding, and allowed patients to return to their normal diet sooner."},{"title":"Effects of Whey Protein Supplementation Pre- or Post-Resistance Training on Muscle Mass, Muscular Strength, and Functional Capacity in Pre-Conditioned Older Women: A Randomized Clinical Trial","abstract":"Aging is associated with sarcopenia and dynapenia, with both processes contributing to functional dependence and mortality in older adults. Resistance training (RT) and increased protein intake are strategies that may contribute to health improvements in older adults. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the effects of whey protein (WP) supplementation consumed either immediately pre- or post-RT on skeletal muscle mass (SMM), muscular strength, and functional capacity in pre-conditioned older women. Seventy older women participated in this investigation and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: whey protein pre-RT and placebo post-RT (WP-PLA, n = 24), placebo pre-RT and whey protein post-RT (PLA-WP, n = 23), and placebo pre- and post-RT (PLA-PLA, n = 23). Each group ingested 35 g of WP or PLA. The RT program was carried out over 12 weeks (three times per week; 3 \u00d7 8\u201312 repetition maximum). Body composition, muscular strength, functional capacity, and dietary intake were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for repeated measures, with baseline scores as covariates were used for data analysis. A time vs. group interaction (p < 0.05) was observed with WP-PLA and PLA-WP presenting greater increases compared with PLA-PLA for SMM (WP-PLA = 3.4%; PLA-WP = 4.2%; PLA-PLA = 2.0%), strength (WP-PLA = 8.1%; PLA-WP = 8.3%; PLA-PLA = 7.0%), and the 10-m walk test (WP-PLA = \u221210.8%; PLA-WP = \u221211.8%; PLA-PLA = \u22124.3%). Whey protein supplementation was effective in promoting increases in SMM, muscular strength, and functional capacity in pre-conditioned older women, regardless of supplementation timing. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03247192.","sectioned":false,"PMCID":5986443,"simplification":"As people get older, they may experience a loss of muscle mass and strength, which can affect their independence and increase their risk of death. One study looked at how weight training and taking whey protein could help improve health in older women. \n\nSeventy women took part in the study and were placed in one of three groups. The first group took whey protein before weight training and a placebo after, the second group took a placebo before weight training and whey protein after, and the final group took a placebo before and after weight training. All groups carried out weight training three times a week for 12 weeks.\n\nThe study found that the groups that took whey protein (either before or after training) saw better improvements in muscle mass, strength, and walk time compared to the groups who only took a placebo. This suggests that consuming whey protein, no matter when it's taken, can help improve muscle mass, strength and overall health in older women. The study has been registered and can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03247192."},{"title":"LDL-cholesterol lowering effect of a generic product of simvastatin compared to simvastatin (Zocor\u2122) in Thai hypercholesterolemic subjects \u2013 a randomized crossover study, the first report from Thailand","abstract":"BACKGROUND.\nIt is commonly agreed that people with a high blood LDL-cholesterol will have a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) than people with low blood LDL-cholesterol. Due to the increasingly high costs of medication in Thailand, the government has set up several measures to combat the problem. One of such strategies is to promote the utilization of locally manufactured drug products, especially those contained in the National Drug List. Simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is listed as an essential drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Here, we reported the study on the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of a generic simvastatin product in comparison with the Zocor\u00a9, in 43 healthy thai  volunteers.\n\nMETHOD.\nThe generic product tested  was Eucor\u00a9, locally manufactured by Greater Pharma Ltd., Part, Thailand, and the reference product was Zocor\u00a9 (Merck Sharp & Dohme, USA). The two products were administered as 10-mg single oral doses in a two-period crossover design. After drug administration, serial blood samples were collected every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. The major parameter monitored in this study was blood LDL-cholesterol.\n\nRESULT.\nAfter taking the drugs for the first 8 weeks, no statistically significant difference was dedected in blood LDL-cholesterol between the first (Zocor\u00a9-treated) and the second (Eucor\u00a9-treated) groups. After crossover and taking drugs for further 8 weeks, a similar result was obtained, i.e., no significant difference in blood LDL-cholesterol between the first (Eucor\u00a9-treated) and the second (Zocor\u00a9-treated) groups was observed. Upon completion of the 16-week study, there was also no statisticaly significant difference in the changes of all tested blood parameters between the two products (randomized block ANOVA, N = 37). Only minor side effects, mainly dizziness and nausea, were observed in both products.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nOur study demonstrated no significant differences in the therapeutic effect and safety between the generic and original simvastatin products.","sectioned":true,"PMCID":65514,"simplification":"BACKGROUND\nPeople with high levels of \"bad\" cholesterol, known as LDL-cholesterol, have a greater chance of getting heart disease. In Thailand, the cost of medicines is getting very high, so the government is encouraging people to take medications that are made locally, which are cheaper. One such drug is Simvastatin, which is used to lower high cholesterol levels. In this study, we compared how effective and safe a local version of Simvastatin is compared to an international one, in 43 healthy Thai people.\n\nMETHOD\nThe local Simvastatin we used was Eucor\u00a9, made by Thai company Greater Pharma Ltd. The international version was Zocor\u00a9, made by Merck Sharp & Dohme in the USA. Both versions of the drug were given to the participants once in the form of a 10-mg pill. We then took blood samples from them every 4 weeks for 16 weeks to see how much \"bad\" cholesterol was in their blood.\n\nRESULT\nThere was no significant difference in the amount of \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood of the people who took the local drug versus the international drug. Similarly, after switching the drugs between the groups halfway through the study, we again found no significant difference. At the end of the 16-week study, we found no remarkable differences between the two drugs in all tested blood parameters. There were minor side effects from both drugs - mainly dizziness and nausea.\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study found that the local Simvastatin (Eucor\u00a9) is just as safe and effective at lowering \"bad\" cholesterol as the international Simvastatin (Zocor\u00a9)."}]
