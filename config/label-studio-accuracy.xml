    "data": {
      "source": "OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN.\nDepot somatostatin analogues are well accepted as either adjuvant or primary therapy for acromegaly, and their long dosage intervals facilitate adherence to treatment. Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg, every 4â€“8 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1â€“2 weeks.\n\nPATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.\nPatients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, â‰¥ 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.\n\nRESULTS.\nNinety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77Â·7%). Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide AutogelÂ® than with lanreotide microparticles (3Â·8 (0Â·5) vs 4Â·3 (0Â·5) ng/ml; P < 0Â·001). GH levels < 2Â·5 ng/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH < 2Â·5 ng/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide AutogelÂ® and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide AutogelÂ® and treatment was well accepted.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nLanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg every 4â€“8 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7â€“14 days.",
      "target": "GOAL AND PLAN\nThe goal of this study was to see if giving lanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks worked as well as giving lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every week or two for treating acromegaly, a condition that makes the body produce too much growth hormone. Giving medicine less often could make it easier for people to stick with treatment.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND WHAT WE MEASURED.\nWe asked people to join this study if they had been using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg in the past, and it had worked for them. We gave the patients 3 to 5 shots of lanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg. If they had been getting lanreotide microparticles each week before the study, we gave them lanreotide autogelÂ® every 4 weeks. We adjusted the timing based on how often they were getting their old medication. We checked their growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels after their last shots.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND.\nNinety-eight patients joined the study and 93 finished it. The amount of growth hormone in their bodies showed that both formulas worked about the same. On average, the growth hormone levels were slightly lower with the AutogelÂ® than the microparticles. Symptoms were better controlled with the AutogelÂ® and patients were happy with the treatment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\nUsing lanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg every 4 to 8 weeks works just as well and is as well tolerated as using lanreotide microparticles 30 mg every one to two weeks in treating acromegaly.",
      "question": "What is the motivation for this study about the effect of giving lanreotide at a higher dose with longer interval will have on acromegaly.",
      "answer": "Drugs called depot somatostatin analogues (which slow the production of hormones and include lanreotide) are often used as an additional or the initial treatment for acromegaly."
